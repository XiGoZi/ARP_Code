✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Abu Dhabi to Baku,Jul-24,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," My dissatisfaction with the airport transfer service provided by Wizz Air in Baku, Azerbaijan. Unfortunately, our experience was far from satisfactory, and I feel compelled to share the issues we encountered. Despite the voucher indicating that the driver would wait at the arrival area, we found no one there upon our arrival. My partner called the contact number provided, only to be told that they were unaware of our scheduled transfer. After sending the confirmation voucher via WhatsApp, we had to wait for over an hour before the car finally arrived. The vehicle that arrived was old, broken, and lacked air conditioning. We paid AED 241 (approximately AZN 111.55) for this service, which is quite expensive. Considering the high cost, we expected a better experience. In comparison, using the local app BOLT, the same journey would have cost just 7 manats. Our experience with Wizz Air's airport transfer service was highly disappointing and not worth the expense. I hope that you will take this feedback seriously and take the necessary steps to improve your services to prevent other customers from having a similar experience.",negative,-0.650168,0,20,8.531707,5.905089

Wizz Air unlawfully charged me and refused my refund claim request also even due to their having both system error, website issues and Wizz Air app technical issues today they have the audacity to send an email update stating that their system is working again for people to use and book further flights.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bucharest to Birmingham,Jul-24,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," On the 04.07.2024 I had my flight back to UK from Romania at 06:10 morning time. All good until the boarding was complete. The flight departure was settled for 06:10 and after 30 min of delay I activated the service button so I can ask one of the crew members about how long the delay will be. A lady from the crew came and she didn’t had an answer regarding how long the delay will be, I asked to be kept informed about this issue and she replied that she will ask the pilot to make an announcement. Nothing happened. No messages from Wizz Air company regarding the delay, no information provided by the crew members. I was just waiting knowing nothing. After another 20 min of waiting I see other lady from the crew coming out from the pilot cabin. Thinking that she may know something by now, especially because she stayed with the Capitan, I activated again the service button so I can ask her about the delay. She then came to me asking me straight away if I speak Romanian to which I replied yes. Then she asked me again if I'm sure I speak Romanian and I replied that for the last 40 years I keep on talking Romanian daily as I'm a Romanian citizen. This questions put me in such embarrassment and discomfort. I felt like a child at the kindergarten. The lady crew member then told me that “this is not a bus to answer how long the delay will be” to which I replied that I know and as well I haven't paid £1 for the ticket. Then, the lady crew member saw that I was having my mobile phone in my hand and told me that filming the crew is not allowed and asked me to delete the video. I replied to her that I did not film the crew or the cabin to which she demanded to handle my phone to her so she could check if there is any video with the crew. I refused to give her my personal item because she doesn't have the legal right to ask me this and only the competent authorities can ask for this. She then called the Frontier Police to escort me out from the plane. I need to specify that during the whole interaction between me and the lady crew member I had a decent language, I didn't engage other passengers, I wasn't aggressive with anyone, I wasn’t under the influence of any substance and I did no damage. Even being escorted I kept my calm. The lady crew member gave me a paper called “the final warning” in which she mentioned the fact that I was talking loud and bad towards the crew and I refused to delete the video with the crew. Which video, which bad words? I did not had the right to reply or to agree or disagree with what she wrote down on the “the final warning” sheet. The Frontier Police said that not even they are allowed to ask me to handle my personal item. This lady crew member attitude put me in such a big discomfort from all points of view. And as an end to my story, as an advice I would say: For your mental and social health avoid Wizz Air!!

Very limited in flight service, so no food or drinks etc. They change flight times and your seat number online, without notice, leading to several confrontations.

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Abu Dhabi to Salalah,Jul-24,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"   My recent experience with Wizz Air was incredibly frustrating due to their poorly highlighted online check-in process. There is no prominent information indicating that passengers need to complete online check-in before arriving at the counter, or they will face a penalty. This detail is buried at the bottom of the page, which many people, especially first-time travelers, may not notice. As a result, I found myself in a long queue at the airport only to be informed that I had to pay a penalty of AED 190 for not checking in online. This was a huge disappointment and a stressful experience. I strongly urge Wizz Air to update their website and app to clearly inform passengers about the necessity of online check-in to avoid such penalties. In addition to the check-in issue, Wizz Air has numerous hidden clauses and additional charges that passengers need to be aware of. While the initial ticket price appears low, they start adding various fees, such as admin fees and charges for baggage over 10 kg. This deceptive practice results in a much higher final cost than initially advertised. I booked with Wizz Air only once, and I will never make that mistake again. I do not recommend this airline to anyone. If you have to spend a little more, consider other airlines to avoid the dissatisfaction and hidden fees associated with Wizz Air.",negative,-0.851394,0,20,8.531707,5.905089

Got very expensive over the last year but only provides red eye flights which are frequently delayed or cancelled. Costs seem low initially for the flight, but really if you add luggage, seat selection you are better off just flying with an established carrier not this so called low-cost. Another hidden cost is that Wizz usually flies to airports very far away from the marketed destination. So in the end you have to spend another 20-30 euros for a bus or another transfer. So is it still low cost? Seats are cramped. Service is all at a cost, not even water is provided. Plus the very annoying sales of perfumes and other amenities which are aggressively promoted via the intercom system. For European standards this is truly a nightmare.

It had to be confirmed no later than 3 hours earlier, which we tried, however, their website did not work and we could not, and they charged us an additional 25 euros per person, it did not matter that it was not our fault and that we have proof that the website did not work. No one knows how to give information to whom to file a complaint and ask for a refund, but we were only told that if we don't pay, there are no tickets for us even if we bought them. to make matters worse, we were given a seat at the exit in case of danger, and we were traveling with a child under 16 who cannot sit there because it is not allowed, so a problem arose and we had to move and beg people to switch seats with us.

✅ Trip Verified ,A321NEO,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Luton to Amman QAI,Jan-24,3,1,1,,,1,3,yes,6," The outbound flight from Luton to Amman on the 24th was a pretty disorganized and a stressful flight. At Luton Airport, Wizz Air management starts boarding passengers through the gate when the aircraft isn’t there. In turn theres 237 passengers jammed in a single area, on board (LTN-AMM) the crew were very attentive and energized, However the hype for Christmas was also uncomfortable as they kept making announcements every 10 minutes on a evening/night flight when everyone was already tired. I would suggest Wizz Air to at least make their Amman service a more comfortable flight since its a 6h one. On the way back on the 1st - the flight was much better mainly because there were less passengers. A crew member on the aircraft was specifically very rude with my family. We thought to ourselves she may just be tired, therefore we didn’t really say anything. However that wasn’t an excuse to constantly speak in a negative manner. I can’t complain much in the sense that Wizz Air does its job as a budget airline but there’s some management concerns which the airline should address to make the experience a bit more human. Being budget doesn’t mean that you should expect a negative experience I would also say that the onboard menu prices are just inhumane. £5 for a cheese baguette which is 10cm in length? - no thanks. On a 7h flight water should be standard as well I booked my tickets 6 weeks in advance and paid almost 250£ per passenger on a flight which is usually 50£. So it was rather expensive.

Around 15 minutes before boarding, the gate number dissapeared and a delay of 8.5 hours appeared. Staff told us to wait for more infos. At 9PM, they told us that the flight for sure will leave at 3AM, and that we should stay at the airport and wait instead of going home and coming back later. They also promised that there will be staff at the Service Desk at all time to assist us and answer our questions. It is currently 3:40AM, the flight has since been delayed 2 times again, and there hasnt been a single staff member at the service desk since 10PM, thus it is impossible to get any information about the situation.

We were told that ALL expenses would be paid (as they have to by law) - we clarified several times on this phone call if there was a limit and she said no, as long as not 5* accommodation. Fair enough, so we paid everything out of pocket for 4 days and send the receipts to Wizz Air afterwards. This company has been refusing to pay up and only reimbursed us about 20% of our costs - they deem 336 EUR for 2 people for 4,5 extra days in Venice reasonable. That is 42 EUR per person, per day. In Venice. In summer. For accommodation, food and transportation. We have reached out multiple times requesting to be paid the remaining expenses we incurred due to their flight cancellation AND HAVE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE WHATSOEVER.

When all the shops closed at 11:00pm no Wizz Air staff were in sight to provide any food or water. What's worse, there was zero communication from Wizz Air throughout this ordeal. The staff, from check-in to the gate, were not only unhelpful but also incredibly rude when passengers sought information about the delays. No updates were provided about the reasons for the delays or when the flight would actually take off. Wizz Air's treatment of passengers during this experience was shameful.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Eindhoven to Sofia,Jul-23,2,3,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I am deeply disappointed and concerned about the way I was treated by Wizz Air in regard to flight W64326, 27th July 2023, Eindhoven to Sofia. I have confirmed booking Wizz Go, with pre-paid and reserved seat, priority check-in at the airport and free airport check-in – 50’ before departure at Eindhoven Airport. I was not informed that the flight is overbooked, not asked if I would volunteer, no that I would be denied boarding by any means. The online check-in app was not working for whatever reason. I was at the check-in desk at 2 hours before departure, I got a boarding pass and dropped off my baggage. I was at the gate 30' before departure, it was obvious that the flight would be delayed, but there was no information in any way about new departure time and overbooking. The gate service did not asked me if I would volunteer, nor that I would be denied boarding. The flight was delayed more than 1 hour, when I was at the gate checking my boarding pass for boarding I was just ordered to step away and not allowed boarding without any explanation. When I insisted for information what was happening, the ground service girl just told me that Wizz Air had overbooked the flight and somebody else had taken my seat. I was ordered leave the gate and go to complain to Wizz Air. I was given no information what I have to do, where to go, what were my rights, just behaving rude and arrogant, ignoring. The way Wizz Air and gate service treated me put me on high emotional and physical stress, messed up my personal and working plans. I do not care about Wizz Air overbooking practice – it is a bad business practice, it is Wizz Air corporate decision, but I will take care about that for myself. I am much concerned and affected by the services not provided, thought paid, the “denied boarding” rules (if any) and the way ground staff gate service treat such cases – unprofessional, no basic skills about customer service - rude and arrogant. I have already placed a claim; however, I do believe that Wizz Air will do nothing to improve the service of boarding, including denied boarding practice.

Besides the staff was full of attitude and didn't show a little gesture of kindness, at first I thought it was just bad luck with an employee, however after the second flight I understood it is a requirement to get hired, have no manners. The best happened when we landed in Dammam (Saudi Arabia), being around 240 people in the aircraft approximately 150-200 needed to get a connection flight; however, because the airline apparently doesn't have a contract with the airport, we were all obliged to pay EUR130 for a transit visa, even though none of us would step in the country. This was absolutely ridiculous and we got the explanation from the local authorities that they daily faced that issue of people flying with WizzAir. Nothing was ever explained in the reservations email, which should have been detailed even prior of making the booking. As per my experience it was a given that when you are flying internationally and have everything ready for your next flight you just have to cross de ""International transfer"" door at the airport, however Wizz Air had a wonderful surprise for us.

We have been trying to contact them for the past 2 days now. The phone numbers do not work and they charge crazy for them. Online chat is also brushing off all the options that you select and refuses to connect to a live agent.

We had to wait a lot to get through there were people with luggage that were made to paid extra. After an ordeal of waiting like cattle standing and being slowly marched through to check luggage size, we were further corralled towards the embarking gate, and after another about 40 min we were marched towards the plane by foot.

From the moment I booked my ticket until the conclusion of my journey, the airline continuously tried to charge me in every possible way, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. Firstly, during the booking process, I was bombarded with various hidden fees. What appeared to be a reasonably priced ticket quickly turned into a financial burden. Wizz Air charged exorbitant fees for everything, including choosing a seat, bringing carry-on luggage, and even printing boarding passes at the airport.

Anyway calling WizzAir told us the cancellation fee is 80% or the cost of the tickets, if I have to change dates is about 65% of the original ticket costs. They have no travel voucher to offer to be used later as I asked I need no money back. They offered to “negotiate” the cancellation cost of the ticket if we can provide doctor’s records resulting that my wife cannot travel, this is outrageous as medical records are confidential. Seems that letter from my family doctor was not good enough. Anyway I remained with very bad taste of the inhuman experience this company offered basically taking advantage of peoples unfortunate situation to make some money.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Palma Mallorca to Gatwick,Sep-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  As a frequent traveler who has experienced countless flights with various airlines, I feel compelled to share my recent nightmarish encounter with Wizz Air. This scathing review serves as a warning to fellow travelers who value their time, money, and overall peace of mind. Brace yourself for a tale of incompetence, broken promises, and an utter lack of customer care. Let's begin with the initial offense: the cancellation of our flight without any plausible reason. We got an email the morning of our departure so we rushed to the airport to get some clarity only to be informed that your flight has been abruptly scrapped. Shockingly, Wizz Air failed to provide any legitimate explanation for this cancellation, leaving passengers bewildered and stranded without any clue as to what transpired behind the scenes. Additionally, they didn't have an option for both me and my partner to fly out until 3 days later which wouldn't work because of our work schedules. In a desperate bid for assistance, I reached out to Wizz Air's customer service while at the Palma airport. Little did I know that I was about to embark on an infuriating journey of unhelpful agents and contradictory statements. Despite assuring us that we would be reimbursed if we chose to book an alternative flight outside their company, this turned out to be nothing more than a hollow promise. They had no intention of honoring their commitment, leaving us in a state of financial uncertainty and deep disappointment. Refusing to give up, we sought professional help from an external company, hoping they could navigate the treacherous waters of Wizz Air's reimbursement process. Unfortunately, this only added insult to injury. Nine long and arduous months later, we are still fighting for the reimbursement we rightfully deserve. It is inconceivable that an airline, claiming to value its customers, could display such a blatant disregard for their responsibilities. Wizz Air's inability to provide a backup flight for three days highlights their lack of contingency planning and their disregard for the inconvenience caused to their passengers. Furthermore, their callousness in denying our rightful claim and subsequent inability to fulfill their obligations demonstrates a disturbing level of unprofessionalism and an alarming lack of transparency. Traveling should be an enjoyable and stress-free experience, yet Wizz Air has turned it into a nightmare. Their cancellation without reason, broken promises, and refusal to reimburse the amount we paid for an alternative flight have left us feeling betrayed and disillusioned. It is my sincere hope that this review will serve as a cautionary tale to potential passengers considering Wizz Air, urging them to explore alternative options and spare themselves the agony we endured. In conclusion, I strongly advise against choosing Wizz Air for your travel needs. Their lack of accountability, unreliable service, and poor customer care make them an airline that should be avoided at all costs. Spare yourself the headaches and frustrations that come with dealing with this unscrupulous company.",negative,-0.746394,1,18,8.267629,-6.284321

No member of staff knew what was going on. We then got told to go to gate 12. So did other flights to different locations.  Not blaming the staff, they had no idea what was going on just like us.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,TeAviv to Larnaca,Jun-23,2,4,,,,2,2,no,3,"  I think it's misleading to call this a low-fare. It was nothing but. The first indication of a campy ticket was when booking the tickets for two families I added one large (20kg) suitcase to each family. to my surprise, the cost of adding the luggage was per leg and stood at a whopping $130 per leg, per suitcase. In total, I paid $270 for the suitcase. For comparison, the ticket was $162. Additionally, the advertised ticket price changed while I was in the middle of the booking process and jumped by $20 per passenger. So a projected $140 ticket (already pricey for a 37min. flight!) actually climbed to $252 (in a family of 3). This didn't include advanced check in cost, seat selection cost, and other money grabbing options. But the real shocker was upon return. We got to the ticket counter and expected to drop our luggage and get our boarding passes when we were informed unceremoniously that we needed to pay another 50 Euro per person to be checked in. This happened despite the fact that no such fees were asked for on the way from TLV to Larnaca. The ground team threatened to deny our boarding unless we paid. The confirmation email btw only mentioned that ""If possible, always check in online before leaving for the airport. Otherwise, you might have to pay a fee at the airport."" - no clear language there whatsoever. Nothing in red, no advanced warning via email or sms. only an automated response from the check in rep. The supervisor wasn't offering any help either. We had to run to the other side of the terminal, pay the fees, then run all the way to the gate (threatened with a closed gate) only to be left waiting for the bus to the plane another 20 minutes in a small hall with no AC. Finally, a 20min. delay while on the plane is almost always complementary. The final ticket price then jumped to a little over $300, a truly low-low-fare experience for the price of a full-fare flight. I'd say that unless you're traveling alone, with a small backpack, and have all the time in the world, avoid this company at all cost.",negative,-0.635642,0,19,8.531707,5.905089

No sabíamos que había que hacer el c/in on line. Al hacer la reserva seleccione una opción por la que se pagaba un importe mayor pero se podían facturar las maletas. Como en la mayoría de las compañías, di por hecho que al facturar la maleta te daban la tarjeta de embarque en el mostrador, mal por mi parte, deberíamos habernos informado y asumimos que el error es nuestro. Tuvimos que pagar 45€ cada uno, 90€ en total, pero aunque para nosotros esto supone un gasto importante, el disgusto fue el trato recibido por los empleados, nos hablaron y trataron sin respeto y entre risas.

They even did not have a plane in site at time of go to gate. Did not bothered to announce the delay or to make sure the airport displays the delay. NO ANNOUNCEMENT in the airport. The data should have come from this company. Because of the 2 hours delay without any responsibility, they decided it is cheaper to allocate the aircraft after check in is closed. I am pretty sure the hygiene on board is missing in action. And we had a fly proudly flying around with us all the way home. Useless delays, total disrespect of the passengers, constant overbooking/oversold tickets, no time for actually hygiene in the aircraft. An air pirate of the same type as Ryan Air. It is no wonder they are the sole remaining low costs around with multiple routes. It is not complicated to be profitable if you abuse your clients with regulations on your side. Everybody dreams of selling something they don't actually have. It is sad when this is a trip to your holiday. Isn't it? Why do regulations help them? How is it possible to not announce the flight delay until the passengers passed the gate? Because of regulations. So let's change them for better. Do not protect such companies.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to London Gatwick,Apr-23,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," This is the single worst experience with an airline I have ever had. Everything about this was just insane. Promises of 'budget Friendly' were just the start. Me and my partner flew from Athens to Gatwick, £300 with cabin overhead baggage not included? (We are from Australia where this is standard for all airlines) If the tickets were actually budget I would understand. We arrived at Athens airport to find our flight delayed 2 hours. Ok, it's bad having your flight delayed but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since this happens to a lot of airlines. We looked up the aircraft info to find that there was no previous flight. As we waited at the airport we had 5 or 6 different times given to us by Wizz. Once the gate finally opened we made our way. We sat on the ground since seating was not available. Once we were ok to board we were put onto a bus to go to the plane. Once we arrived the driver opened the doors, told us ""don't exit yet"" and so we were left on the bus (packed in very tightly, there are no seats) for 15-20 minutes as we watched the cabin crew cleaning the plane through the windows. Why drive us out if the aircraft is not ready? And the plane has not had a previous flight AND was delayed 2 hours, the plane should have been prepared already? Once we finally got off the bus we were met by what I would find out to be some of the rudest hosts on a plane I have ever met. Every 5 seconds over the PA ""please do not block the aisles to avoid further delays"" to me seemed a bit rich after our experience so far. Also people are boarding, we aren't going to be seated in 3 seconds? When we sat, the aircraft was in a disgustingly awful state. Crumbs are everywhere, rubbish was left in the seat pockets. This aircraft was sitting here at the airport for a long time and the crew had done an abysmal job at preparing for passengers. The flight itself, once we got into the air was ok. Nothing special (they like to push their 'duty free' items on you for purchase, however I found that I could buy most of this stuff at Tesco for half the price). We landed at Gatwick and this is where the true torture began. Passengers stood to collect their luggage. As we were departing, the host grabbed the PA, stared directly into passengers eyes with the most disgusting look I have ever seen from flight crew ""DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT"" this was met with passengers fuming, how are we meant to get our luggage down then? He repeated it as I walked towards the front door of the aircraft ""DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT"" he proceeded to put down the microphone then step in front of me, put his finger to my face and said ""WAIT"" passengers piled behind me after this man had just told us not to block the aisles. He put his finger down ""ok go"". Me and my partner were livid.

In addition there is a delay in their flights with no explanation or even an apology.

We were delighted to see that the same crew member was once again onboard and he immediately recognised us. He went above and beyond to make our flight comfortable and again move us to seats together. Throughout the flight we were well looked after by all the crew who once again were so friendly, making time to chat with us between duties. The flight deck crew did an excellent job as well keeping us informed of turbulence (we had some nasty turbulence on the way out) and ensuring we were well briefed on the route.

And even if you are separated from your buddy in the other airlines, they try to make you seat next to each other when you check in. Not the case with Wizz Air. The other thing - the toy drones are not allowed and nobody from the airline cannot tell you why exactly. Also completely stupid rule which the other airlines don't have.

But even with this myself and my husband are outstanding any form of compensation  It’s completely unacceptable and I really hope Wizz are seriously looked into as they are not operating under the EU law.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Malaga to Bucharest,May-22,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," The experience with this Wizz Flex option is like walking on the street in broad daylight, someone sneaks up on your from behind, extracts 200 Eur from your pocket and walks away. Now the long story: I specifically bought a return flight with Wizz Flex option, in total amount of 260 Eur (212 Eur the actual flight fare and the rest in fees). So I would expect (after reading the Terms & Conditions of Wizz Flex), in the eventuality of asking for refund, to be entitled to 212 Eur back. I postponed the flight once. During this process, the Wizz Air website shows you available dates and after you select the new dates, it computes the price for the new flight and shows you only if there is a difference in price in their favour (if you have to pay something extra or not). I did this, nothing extra to pay, all good here. Later it became clear I will not be able to travel at all, so I went for the second benefit of the Wizz Flex, cancelling and getting a full refund. Surprise: Wizz Air congratulates me for being eligible for a full refund: 40 Eur! At this point I spend more money to call them (the only way to contact is by phone, charge with 1.2 Eur per min), to find out that when I postponed the flight, my refund value was automatically changed to the value of the flight from those new dates. A value which was not even displayed to me during this process. Again, during flight change, Wizz Air computes the value of the new flight and only shows you if you have to pay more for the new dates. It purposely does not warn you that not only you don't have to pay more, but that you are exchanging tickets worth 260 Eur to tickets worth 40 Eur and that this will affect your refund value too. Besides this practice being so obviously mean to trick you, is this even legal? To make a parallel, it is not legal to run an online shop that shows products you can buy, to charge your customers and to not show them the price they will be charged with. Even if you add this to your Terms & Conditions, that the client must do whatever they can to figure out the price and that you're free to charge whatever you like, it is not legal to do so.",positive,0.433229,1,18,8.267629,-6.284321

My friend and I have had problem after problem since we booked flights with them back in Sep 2022. They cancelled our outbound flight to Reykjavik without explanation, and there was no alternative with Wizz Air for the same day we wanted so we cancelled that flight with them and ended up paying more for another airline to fly on same date! They still haven't acknowledged or responded to our requests, let alone refunded the flight fare yet! It’s been 3 months. On a separate return flight with Wizz Air (that shockingly wasn’t cancelled), online check-in did not work - with a message of internal error appearing on the online portal. 3 times I tried to check in online with the same issue recurring, so I had no choice but to leave it there. At the airport, the desk staff made us pay airport check-in fees of 45Euros per person, which is outrageous in itself, despite us explaining the online error we faced, and then said you can contact Wizz Air customer service later to claim this back/ask them to waive fee. Absolutely ridiculous. There is not a Wizz Air representative present at the airport, as all their desk staff is outsourced so trying to have any matters sorted on the day is futile as these staff members have no authority to make decisions. To make matters worse, one of the in-flight crew members were also extremely rude. I was travelling with a friend who became injured during our trip and needed accessibility assistance; the crew member failed to communicate how she would be supported upon landing to get off the aircraft, and became very rude and impatient in her responses, when we asked legitimate questions after landing. We waited until all passengers had left the aircraft, and only then approached them to find out what was going on but we were just sharply told to “Wait!” without any clarification about what help will be offered. It is disgusting that they would treat a vulnerable customer with so much disrespect, and do so little to reassure them. We have been contacting them for months since our initial booking, but have not had any response or any positive action taken to resolve matters via email and through their contact form online. It is almost impossible to get hold of them. They simply don't care, and just want people's money. It seems it is not only their customers they treat so poorly since I spoke to a crew member on the flight, who also moaned that they have received many complaints and even as a staff member, she wasn’t even offered a flight with them to visit her family members who were unwell or easily given time off. It’s clear they are stone cold as a company, and care about nothing but profits. There are so many negative and worrying articles about them in the media. Still, they don’t act on customer complaints in a timely manner. I rarely waste my time and energy on writing bad reviews, but Wizz Air have been so poor with their customer service and strike me as a very unethical company given the countless bad reviews and comments I see online everywhere, that I feel compelled to write my experience also. I would not even give them a single Star but unfortunately you have to click on one to post a review!! I am fuming and will never be using this airline again.

They stated that they could and I asked thoroughly if we got all the money back, which was confirmed several times. Time passed and we heard nothing, we call again for a refund. They stated again that the money was on its way. On the 3rd call, which was 3 days before departure, they suddenly told us, that we could not get the money back! They had since the first call cancelled and deleted our tickets from our Wizz Air page, so now we were without money and tickets.

They first ask for a screenshot of the technical mistake, you show it to them and then they say: ""You should have called our Call centre - it\s your fault."" So by their logic I should have paid 3 EUR a minute for a call in a foreign country for the sake of their technical ""error"" ( it is a usual ""error"" their system seem to be trained to create for several customers on that flight and each of their flights as we figured out at the airport talking to fellow-passengers who were ripped off the same way on the spot).

We only took hand luggage which worked well. Outbound flight to Podgorica went ok with a small delay and staff seemed fairly friendly. However, on our return flight we got delayed 5 times at the airport before being completely cancelled with no reason given. I had no mobile service and the airport had no wifi available for public use. I therefore asked airport staff for help who said they were unable to help and to contact Wizz directly. I eventually managed to get Wizz on the phone who offered me a refund for my cancelled flight but no further assistance. I therefore had to go around asking people to hotspot their mobile data so I could organise alternate flights, hotels etc. Because Podgorica is a small airport we had to travel to Dubrovnik, Croatia to get home. I have since sent a claim to Wizz, the claim was sent over 30 days ago and their website clearly states ""normally dealt within 7 days, certainly within 30 days"" - well that obviously is not true. I have tried contacting Wizz in other ways but they literally make it impossible with every member of staff saying they are unable to assist and unsure what to do. Overall Wizz has been an awful experience and for the sake of saving £50 each on air fares we're currently over £1000 worse off due to rebooking flights, accommodation, taxis etc. I really would recommend choosing a more reputable airline that at least helps out when flights inevitably get cancelled.",negative,-0.556781,1,18,8.267629,-6.284321

So, I arrived at the airport (with two small children!), only to be told that I have to pay 120 euro to be checked in at the airport, otherwise I will not be able allowed in the plane to return to our home in the UK.  I called the customer care line, who reassured me that I should pay the exorbitant fee, keep the receipt and just request a refund once back in the UK. Which I did and the reply was that ""I should have read your terms and conditions and have completed the online check in, as per your terms and conditions"". I have since read many cases where people have been conned in paying the airport check in fee after they could not check in online, due to a fault in the online check in system! This is not a way to run a business, this is fraud! Wizz Air should be ashamed to treat your customers like this and get away with this! This is complete scam.

Almost all the flights which I’ve been on were delayed, sometimes up to 3 hours. The personnel were not helpful at all, every time lying about the time. Or if you ask questions, about complaining they avoid to answer. I start feeling that they fly between the serious companies, which really respect their customers and do everything for their flights to be on time. Last experience was the last one for me choosing this unprofessional company, which have interest only for taking your money, after that you don’t matter for them. Because a redirected flight, I lost my connection to my final destination, I lost my rental car, and my hotel and I had to book a hotel in the new destination and a new flight for the next day for my final destination and another rental car. Besides that they kept us waiting in the new destination airport (which was not the plan)like sheep, while everyone asked questions about what’s happening. No one knew anything, so I get frustrated. All this coming after another flight with Wizz Air where my flight was delayed 3 hours just the day before. And the last one was when I come back after the long story. At the gate I went with the same backpack which I fly with all the time, but this time I had to pay because my backpack was literally 5cm bigger. It’s every time about money and no respect.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bergen to Gdansk,Jun-22,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  My journey as a family of 2 adults and 2 children was to travel from Bergen to Tenerife through Wizzair and LOT airlines in this sequence. As I didn’t find any available direct flights to Tenerife by the time of booking the tickets in April 2022. First, I booked a flight for 4 passengers from Bergen to Gdansk  with WizzAi, which is canceled by Wizzair after the planned departure time). I have booked one night in a hotel in Gdansk on 25/06/2022. Bought 4 tickets for the whole family with LOT Airlines from Gdansk to Warsaw in order to take another aircraft to Tenerife. Booked another 4 tickets from Warsaw to Tenerife through Wizz Air at the end. On the planned day we went to Bergen Airport. The departure time was at 14.05. We received a sms from Wizz Air  the flight is delayed and the estimated departure will be: 14.40, then another sms at 14.27 that the flight was delayed again and the new departure will be at 16.00, then another sms about a new delay to 16.30. At 14.47 they sent sms that the flight was canceled without mentioning the reason for cancellation. No one from WizzAir was in the airport to inform us what to do and no one called us. We went home with our kids again and tried to contact Wizz Air. After 45 minutes waiting over the phone with a paid phone call, they said that there are no other available flights, and we must send them a claim form to get a refund. I tried on my own to find another solution, and I found a flight at 22.40 to travel to another city in Poland (Katowice) where I could rent a car and drive 4 hours to Warsaw in order to catch the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife on the second day. I called them again to rebook this flight, and they assured me that everything is OK. I got the same confirmation number, I rented a car and paid online from Katowice Airport to drive with my family over the night to Warsaw as we did not find a hotel to accommodate us. We went to Bergen Airport again with our kids. The new boarding was at 22.40 on Saturday 25/06/2022, but they told us that the flight was delayed and then was also canceled without giving any reason. No one from Wizz Air was in the airport, the same as for the first time. Just those from Bergen airport gave us a paper stating our rights and they said that Wizzair will contact us, but no one has contacted us. I called WizzAir again. They couldn't find any other alternative flights, and asked me to send them a claim to get a refund and any other expense that I lost due to the two cancellations. I received a SMS at 06.00 am that the flight was canceled. (7 hours after the scheduled departure time). As a result of that , we could not travel to Poland and we missed the hotel accommodation, the flight from Gdansk to Warsaw, the car rental fee in Katowice and on top of that we missed the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife. I searched again and again and I found another route with another airline and of course the price was doubled. The original price was around 9000 Norwegian krone. The only available tickets that I found cost over 20000 NOK. I had to book it. WizzAir left us stranded without any info or help.",negative,-0.598109,1,18,8.267629,-6.284321

We chose to fly with Wizz Air primarily because of the flight times that suited our schedule. Checking in was fine, there were hidden costs that can be expected from budget airlines. I downloaded the App which was not helpful as I had to constantly find the email with my code to access any part of the app. Finding the email was also a challenge as Wizz Air had sent me tons of promotional junk emails. Anyway, all that aside, we were on our merry way. On both flights the luggage check in queue was enormous. We arrived 3 hours before our flight which was not international and were almost late because of the queue. We only queued to tag our pram as we were travelling light, but there was no one to ask and it was not clear on the site. Both flights there was only one staff member for premium and one staff member for economy so either way the queue was ridiculous. Fine, we thought we had the time as Wizz Air (on both trips) had texted to say the flight was delayed. However none of the airport gate signs indicated the flight was delayed so after rushing through, skipping any sort of food with a baby we made it to the gate to leave. The airport sign actually said 'gate closing' but when we arrived there was just a lot of people sitting on the floor wondering what was going on. Eventually after about an hour an announcement that the cabin crew were in the airport was made, but no indication of how long was given. On our outbound flight we waited for an hour and half and ransacked the vending machine to feed our family and on the return flight we must have waited over 2 hours, again in a waiting area with very little seating, I had to stand for almost 2 hours with a 2 year old whilst being almost 7 months pregnant. Not fun. The plane itself was fine. The flight attendants were curt and not friendly. One even threw my receipt down on me whilst serving someone else.

Long story short, Wizz refused to refund the €70 for the check in due to their faulty app, and their mails were filled with accusations (that we were lying), offensive insults (implying we were too stupid to use the app), and total lack of understanding or interest at all.

After that she told me to wait few minutes for the Hungarian airline reply. Few minutes she left her desk so I went to other guy working in special assistance desk I gave him the passport and the booking number. He wrote the details of ticket and he pointed to the service desk behind me and told me to go there. I went there within One minute the lady gave me back my documents.

When we tried to check-in online, the system said that the seat selection is not possible at this time. Without it, you cannot proceed. So we were not able to check in online (despite trying several times). At the airport, you won’t have to pay the 13€ they advertise online, but rather a whooping 40€ per person. The fun part is, that they have no personnel at the airport and the numbers that the airport staff has, do not work either. So you can pay the fee or call the call center for just 2-3€ per minute.

What kind of airline charges for something as basic checking in? Moreover before boarding they conducted arbitrary ‘checks’ on passengers baggages and was made to pay 30€/person under the pretext that our bags do not fit under the seat, worst part is the atrocious attitude of the staff.

Called them several times, only to be put on hold and then hung up on, despite being charged for the calls per minute. These were 30-40 minute calls.

We arrived in Santorini too late for the (latest) 11.00 p.m. car pick up. This meant we spent 40 Euros (taxi fare) to travel to our accommodation. We then had to spend another 40 Euros in the morning to travel back to the airport to collect our car. In addition we only received a bottle of water and a kitkat on the plane as compensation - not a meal as specified in their conditions. Our return flight (17/07/22) landed four hours late - adding a £30 additional cost to our transport home. The level of service was appalling. On the return journey no reason was given for the four hour delay. It can only have been a Wizz Air issue as a RyanAir Flight at 9.20 p.m. took off on the same route only 6 minutes late. On the outward journey the cabin crew were surly, rude and offensive. They refused to answer questions from multiple customers about the delay. They literally threw kitkats at customers when handing them out. One said openly to someone sitting behind us ... ""We are rude to the customers because they are rude to us."" Customers were not rude - they were only asking genuine questions. The service was the worst I have ever seen - not just when flying. Customers deserve better.

And then after an hour of waiting we were informed that the flight had been cancelled and to come forward for 4 euro voucher. Yes 4 euros for waiting 4 hours, one euro per hour! Sometime later we told there would be a coach to take us to a hotel. The message from Wizz Air was to rebook or get a refund as the next flight out wasn’t till Wednesday the 13th of July.

My party and I are very disappointed with Wizz Air. We had just flown into Milan from New York and we were connecting to Cagliari, Sardinia in April 2022. We were sure to have our bags the allotted and accepted sizes. When we went to the Check-in Desk, the woman at the check-in in Milan said that we needed to purchase our boarding passes. She further stated that two of our bags were not compliant when indeed there were others identical that went through without being charged an extra hundred dollars. The folks traveling with us are 80 years old, one with a cane, and this woman showed no compassion. Because my phone was in airplane mode on the flight right before this, I was unable to check in within 3 hours prior to this flight. I had my tickets and barcode on my phone. She gave us two little pieces of paper and we had to go to this kiosk and wait 15 minutes in line to purchase two more boarding passes. We had purchased these tickets through e-Dreams where each time I purchased a ticket, the price went up. I paid an extra $125 for two more boarding passes. I was about to pay for my personal ticket but then I thought, I am going to go straight to the line and not go through that woman because I have my ticket. That worked for me, but the elderly couple were extremely distraught and upset over this experience. I ended up ordering two new tickets for them for the return trip. I double-ordered because I did not want to get saddled with another boarding pass fee. I did not use e-Dreams either this time and that helped. I contacted Customer Support a I do not like to write negative reviews, but they kept giving me the run-around. Incidentally, we got through with our bags on the return trip as we refused to go to the check-in desk and our bags were fine sidewise.

Before you arrive to the airport, you’ll have an email saying that the plane is delayed for around 1 hour. By the time you walk inside the airport lounge, there will be another delay for 35 minutes. When you are queuing for the gate and passport clearance, another 30 minutes. Then, just when you think you’ve finally made it inside the plane and ready to take off, they slap you with an additional 45 minutes delay. You get an almost 3 hours delay in what is supposed to be a 3.5 hours flight. You’d think by then at least they’ll give you free peanuts for compensation.  If they could legally monetise your complaints and suffering, I bet they would. Yet I still consider myself getting a comparatively better flight experience, compared to what other reviewers are saying here. If you’re using online check-in, make sure you pay for the £2 option for “online check in”, even if they stated that online check in will be available “for free” 48 hours before flight. If you don’t pay, the website/app will display an error on the last step of your check in. Changing browser, clearing cache, or calling the customer service won’t help you. After you pay, however, the error magically goes away!  I know now is that paying extra for a more reliable airline might really be worth it.

The check in crew and the cabin crew were fantastic and I did witness how the check in crew in Athens were insulted and sworn at when all they were doing was their job. I also witnessed how some people blatantly lied to try and get what they wanted, such as the woman who had 3 cases but only paid for one and then refused to pay for the other 2 and blamed the very patient and polite man at the check in desk. Its amazing how people want to pay less but expect and demand more and then blame the staff for their incompetence.

Then on the next day I have received more that ridiculous message from them: "" Please note that the type of aircraft booked for your flight has been changed so that the seat (s) you originally selected is no longer available, and we are currently unable to allocate you space on the new aircraft. We are sorry for the inconvenience. Please arrive at the airport 3 hours before the departure time of your flight to receive a new allocated seat (if available)."" I had to call them and ask wtf this message means. The lady explain that even if I have ticket and pay extra for priority it is possible when I go to the airport to not have a place in the airplane. I am obligated to pay extra for place also, other wise I can not complain. Then I bought place for 10 euro, because the trip is important for me.

Despite being in the middle of a global pandemic, few passengers and none of the gate staff wore masks. Passengers were advised they would have to put on masks on the plane. Then, at the point at which we should have boarded, the gate agent came back into the room and informed passengers (maskless of course and expelling aerosols over everyone) that the ground crew would not be able to load the plane and that any passengers with checked bags would not get them in Milan. These passengers could decide not to travel or follow up the missing bags later. We then boarded to be held on the ground for 2 hours while they attempted to resolve what transpired to me a wildcat strike by ground staff. The announcements from the cockpit were few and far between and refused to take any responsibility for the situation or suggest any attempts to mitigate it. The cabin crew did not nothing to police mask wearing among the passengers, with people sneezing and coughing all over the cabin while not wearing masks. Indeed, the crew were rather casual in mask wearing themselves, with the purser frequently pulling hers down. We eventually left and arrived two hours late. Upon arrival into Milan, we were all piled into a crowded bus, again with no checking of mask wearing. Admittedly, the crew did offer free water and a small snack to apologize for the delay.

This is a loss of over £100 to myself due to their total lack of understand of the current situation. There was no remorse for the people suffering in the Ukraine right now, no lack of understanding as to why the tour operator cancelled my holiday, just a straight ""no"", you cannot have my money back.

So the fee you see is just to get you through the door - any bag larger than a shoe box you pay for - check in at the airport £35 per person. Seats - The price you see is for a ticket. I am yet to find a way to book without being charged £20 on top for a seat. Regardless of whether I choose the seats or allow them to. If there is a way, it’s hidden or not obvious. Inflight - Usual small selection of expensive snacks - anything goes wrong expect to be quoted terms and conditions stating they can’t help and you should have known this. Refunds - if you actually manage to get one it is to a Wizz Air account to use with Wizz Air. So not actually a refund at all. It cost me €70+ euros for checking in 2 people at the airport which I was forced to do as their app is unreliable. It always seems to crash when trying to use it to check in so you need to check in from a computer. I was one of many dozen at the airport on both recent occasions when I travelled with the same issue and same huge additional bill to pay before we could travel. They don’t care, they say pay or don’t travel and lose all the money as our refund policy prevents you refunding under such circumstances unless you bay x 10 for a flexible refundable ticket.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Warsaw to Bergamo,Oct-21,2,3,2,,,1,2,no,2,"  There is a new model of airline that desperately wants to undercut the prices of other airlines to get your business, and that is Wizz Air. They present a low priced ticket to snipe your attention and your money, then once you’ve committed your purchase, they add on all of the extras. Do you  want to sit with your young child? They’ll charge you for that. Do you want to carry a bag with you larger than a computer case? They’ll charge you for that. Did you want to check in for your flight somehow? They’ll charge you for that (they even charge for online check in). You get a cheap price up front until they secure your business, but once they have it, the stack on the extra fees until your ticket price becomes comparable to an actual reputable airline. You will not be able to fly without paying extra fees. Because I didn’t check in online the day before (because you know, I have things to do before I go on vacation) they charged me an extra $150 dollars just to do a regular check in. Then, because I had a cabin-sized bag and a camera bag, they charged me an extra $25 for that. Then because I didn’t pay for assigned seats they actually sat my four year old child away from us. They had it on record that he was four years old and their seating arrangement came up with that! Can you believe it? Sure we could switch it around so he wasn’t unaccompanied, but they were perfectly fine with separating the child from his family because a fee wasn’t paid. That’s a pretty gross business practice and I almost wonder if it was intentional because a fee wasn’t paid. For real. This becomes a moral and ethical issue when they will make a child sit alone unless you pay an extra fee for seating. It’s actually a disgusting business model and I will never fly this deceptive airline again. Just pay the extra money for a more reputable airline instead of this sneaky nonsense that Wizz Air pulls on its clients. So what is Wizz Air prioritizing? Cheap shot fees over customer service and satisfaction. DO NOT book this airline because it looks like a deal. It is not a good deal. They will loot you in one way or another by the time you get on that plane, and if you don’t pay the extra fees, they’ll show you why you better pay them in advance next time. Go with a more reputable airline that doesn’t hide fees and carry on such underhanded business. Somewhere a board of directors is congratulating itself for this business model. So much for ethics and customer service. Cleary a thing of the past. ",negative,-0.561752,1,18,7.416619,-6.466922

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Budapest to Reykjavik,Sep-21,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," I had an extremely negative experience with Wizz Air yesterday while attempting to fly to Reykjavik. First, I received my boarding pass on my phone prior to arrival at the airport and didn't need to check any baggage, so I went straight through security and into the airport. Budapest airport doesn't announce the gate for your flight until about 30 minutes prior to check-in closing, so I waited around for a while. Finally, my gate information appears and I went straight to my gate to check in (almost the first one in line). Right away, I am asked for my covid documentation which I have in the form of the EU Digital CovidPass, which is accepted in Iceland and is what I obtained especially for this trip (I'm am American citizen and was fully vaccinated in America, which makes this a lengthy process). The girl at check in says that it is not sufficient and I will also need a negative covid test to travel. First of all! I checked the travel restrictions for Iceland several times prior to my journey and read in numerous places that a test was not necessary. ""Can you visit Iceland? Yes. All travelers – regardless of origin – are welcome to visit Iceland if they can show either a certificate of full vaccination against COVID, or a certificate of previous COVID infection."" - Icelandair I assume, therefore, that with my EU residence permit and EU Digital CovidPass, that I would be OK for travel. Second of all, neither that service that I booked through (Kiwi) or my airline (Wizz) provided any information about what documents I would need until the second I arrived at the gate, only 30 minutes before the closing of check-in. Finally, almost everyone who I interacted with was rude, and completely uninterested in helping me find a solution. I could have received a rapid test at Budapest airport in time, or there is a perfectly valid option to receive a test in Iceland and quarantine until the results return. No matter the suggestion I made, the Wizz Air authorities were disrespectful and adamant that I do not board the plane. And I believe its also relevant to add that I'm a 19 year old solo female traveler, for which the thought of missing my flight and being stranded in a foreign country is not particularly pleasant, however I was met with no sympathy from anyone during this experience.

They were not able to accept payment at the check-in counter, so we had to find a hidden counter at the end of the airport (not even labeled with Wizz Air) in order to pay. The payment system was painfully slow, taking up to 10 minutes per person since they had to document the payment through handwriting. This process took an hour to go through about five groups. No exaggerating. Then our flight didn't even start boarding on time, as the flight before us from Wizz Air was exceptionally delayed due to a large number of passengers needing to do the same process of paying to be able to check-in.

As I approached the Wizz Air desk to check in my luggage ground crew decided not to accept his test because according to them the test expired because it was taken too early in the morning on 14.07. I pleaded with them that Maltese PCR test does not even include a time because only the date is relevant to them. They arm wrestled me, under threat of denying my son check in and boarding, to have my son take another PCR test at the airport which cost 800 PLN (around 200 Eur). This is over and above the 330 PLN I already spent on the first PCR test. When I arrived in Malta I presented to the ground crew checking the Covid 19 documents the PCR test disputed by the Wizz Air ground crew in Warsaw. It was accepted without question. I pointed out to the officer the timing difference but he dismissed it as immaterial.

✅ Trip Verified ,A320-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Luton to Cluj,Jun-21,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I would like to make a formal complaint about the crew on the Wizz Air morning flight from Luton to Cluj from the 11th of June, regarding their lack of action towards enforcing Covid safety rules and regulations. Many of the passengers on the flight were either not wearing masks at all, or wearing them in such a way that it was neither covering their mouth nor their nose. I initially kindly asked some of the infringing passengers to properly wear the mask, to which they first ignored me and then they started making insulting comments towards me in Romanian (I speak the language so I understood what they said). When I raised this issue with members of the crew, they shrugged me off and told me that there is nothing they can do about it and that I should sort this issue. I do not believe that it is the job of passengers to enforce basic covid safety rules, and I also believe that the airline has a duty of care towards all its passengers. The incident made me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe during the entire duration of the flight. Moreover, I noticed that during the entire duration of the flight, no member of the flight crew took any measure or said anything towards other rule infringing passengers, not even when passengers without masks were passing by them on the corridor. I find this to be unacceptable, for a member of the flight crew to pass multiple infringing passengers on the corridor and not do even as much as ask them to follow international guidelines and regulations regarding safety during the Covid Pandemic. I am very disappointed in this and will think twice from now on about flying or recommending WizzAir to others.",negative,-0.802649,1,18,7.416619,-6.466922

I used to like them and used often for flights to many countries. But alas, the airline has changed! Now it feels that they are solving their cash flow problems by allowing new booking only to cancel them later, often “at the last minute” (a few hours before the flight). My flights to Moscow in June 2021 were cancelled twice, second time I was already in a hotel near the airport as the flight was very early morning, so had to come in the ending. So I lost money on transport, COVID test and hotel. My friends flight to St Petersburg was also cancelled, she opted for a refund which is promised in 30 days… Good luck with that. When they cancel the flight, they offer refund or re-book, but refund only for “new” money, not if your used credit accumulated with them during pandemic for the past cancelled flights… so I had to re-book. And since then my booking was cancelled or amended three more times within 2 days. Dates get pushed further and further away from originally booked flights, like a month and a half later. I checked availability on site prior rebooking and noticed that tickets price is 3-4 times higher than mine… so my guess is that my booking is being bumped off as they sell tickets for much higher price! Or may be they don’t intend to fly at all, just collect new payments anyway to save themselves…. In addition some add-on services are NOT refundable as it turned out, specifically “provided by partners”. Once after cancellation and request to add credit to the account I discovered that around £18 “disappeared” without explanation. I’m not sure what “service” was deducted. I only had “priority” added, I wouldn’t have thought it was a partner service.

No, it is not just for your preferred seats, but irrespective of which seats you select and occasionally you can't even do that. Note that the Wizz Air online check-in closes 3 hours before departure! 2) To not pay for the check-in, according to the Wizz Air website, is possible at the airport by using the self-service check-in, and if those are not available at the traditional check-in desk. 3) However, this is not the case. At Milan Malpensa Terminal 1 on Friday, and at Vienna Terminal 3 on Sunday (today), there was no self-service check-in available (I confirmed this with the available check-in staff), and the traditional check-in counter would only check us in if we paid €15/person. 4) This is not all, at MXP the payment is handled by another desk which charges a €5/person commission and at VIE the commission is €5/transaction. So when you book with Wizz Air you need on paying at least €7-8 for the check-in online, or €15 if you do so at the airport plus €5 commission. This is not an optional extra service! By the way, the check-in staff cannot help you because they ""do not work for Wizz Air"" (they told me this in both MXP as well as VIE).

Then you pay for various extras. I paid for 10KG luggage I didn’t actually need. I thought I was signing up for priority but to be honest I did the booking quickly and didn’t read everything. Trick is to read very carefully regarding the numerous add on options. I only had a really small bag so didn’t need that add on at all. What I should have done was chose my seating at the time of booking. I waited till after and it ended up costing me more. No doubt about it, their software will stick you in a middle seat, probably far away form anyone else in the booking. Trick is to select your seat at the time of Booking. I am 6 ft so needed an aisle seat. I got this. The flight was manageable for me, even though my other leg was pressing against the seat but it wasn’t uncomfortable. With my other leg in the aisle as much as possible. Was an hour and a half late on the outbound and 30 min late inbound. On the outbound this was an airport issue. New plane. Good take off and landing. On the return MXP to LTN would like to give a special shout out to Marta who was very nice, polite and friendly. Good experience all round. My flight came to £95 with the extras but still cheaper than other airlines. The days of mega cheap fares are still there as long as you have no luggage and take it as it comes. Again £25 for a return to Italy isn’t bad. They handed Covid measures well. They constantly reminded people to wear a mask which was good. But obviously the plane was full.

Since it was planned to be a 10 days trip I accepted it, soon after that I received another email with the information that my inbound flight was moved forward one day because of ""operational reasons"". So accepting this again finally meant that my entire trip was cut down from 10 to 8 days. The next point on the downside was that after these changes I got the information that my flights were unable for online check-in. However my partner could check-in online without problems although I was the one with the so called ""priority"" status. Because of that I ended up with center seats on both sectors. I have to mention that check-in on both airports was smooth and done within 2 minutes. I also have to say that for short flights the Wizz Airseat configuration is acceptable but definitely not what you would get on premium airlines (230 instead of 200 allows an idea how tight everything is). The crew was nice and seemed to be motivated and drinks from the onboard bistro service were sold at reasonable prices. Both flights landed ahead of time and WIZZ managed the new COVID procedures very well and distributed the necessery health declarations during boarding. Would I recommend WIZZ for short flights? Yes I would, I would like to believe that the flight changes were owed to the extemporized schedule they still have after the total lockdown of air traffic.",negative,-0.264176,1,17,6.605298,-6.357842

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Luton to Thessaloniki,Jul-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I bought the expensive (FLEX or something) ticket for 1 July from Luton to Thessaloniki for 26th July. The Greek Government  said that direct flights from the UK to Greece would continue to not be permitted from 1 July (they were not permitted during June, and they were thinking of allowing them from 1st July onwards, but changed their minds, and first announced that on 26th June). He also said that the official announcement was going to come out on 29th June. I didn't want to wait till 1 day before my flight for WizzAir to cancel it (and I found out from others that they ended up cancelling it on the 30th and a mere 14 hours before the actual flight), thus I tried to book another flight. In that effort, I ended up cancelling my ticket which led to the first ridiculous policy they have - it takes 72 hours for them to put the ""refunded"" money into a ""Wizz Air account"", why 72 hours? The second ridiculous policy is that after they added it I would only have 3 months to book another flight with them, otherwise they keep the money, which is ridiculously short even for pre-COVID times, it should be 12 months at least, and probably 24 or 36 now that COVID is around. I would have found that reasonable. But regardless, I couldn't wait 72 hours to book another flight with them, so I ended up booking with another company for my actual flight. Once the 72 hours passed, my money was added to the ""Wizz Air Account"", after which I proceeded to try to get a refund to one of my actual bank accounts. In that process, they ask for the reason for the refund, and they have two new options ""Cancellation initiated by Wizz Air due to COVID"" and ""Cancellation initiated by customer due to COVID"" - I picked the second option, assuming that there is a difference from a similar cancellation pre-COVID times, and thus that I would actually get a refund (otherwise what's the point of having such an option). Apparently, cancelling my flight due to COVID (a flight which was gonna get cancelled for sure by them eventually) and having bought the more expensive ticket wasn't enough to get a refund. They hide behind T&C and maybe legally they are ok with doing so, but personally I find this bad practice, ridiculous, and won't ever be using them again.",negative,-0.738732,1,17,6.605298,-6.357842

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,Feb-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I bought return tickets for my entire family (5 persons, one of which 3 years old) for the above mentioned flights in October 2019. The flight was scheduled for 19 May 2020. Given the worldwide pandemic crisis, lockdown restrictions were set in place by the government of Romania and UK. As such, I called WizzAir customer service at the beginning of April 2020 to enquire about the flight status. I was advised that the flight was still going ahead as planned and that passengers will be informed about cancellations due to Covid19 via email (when applicable). When I asked about the notice period I was informed there is not a set notice period and it could vary from 2 weeks to next-day cancellation notice. WizzAir personnel advised me not to cancel my booking as yet and wait for further communication closer to the flight date, and that if I still wanted to cancel the flights due to the Covid19 pandemic and further restrictions inposed by government then I should do so 14 days prior to flight date to ensure I am not charged additional cancellation fees. I called customer service again on the 1st of May 2020 and I was advised the flight is still going ahead as scheduled and if I wanted to cancel the flights WizzAir will charge 60 Euros/person/flight. This is unacceptable considering the current worldwide situation, and more specifically the restrictions imposed by the government. The UK is under lockdown with no end date in sight (at the point of this complaint), which means all non-essential travel is not permitted. Additionally, social distancing restrictions are further imposed by the Romanian Government and the UK government, including 2 meters distance between people. These measures were not respected. As such, the flight should have been cancelled, in line with government guidelines. It is not acceptable for a company not to adhere to Government guidelines and put customers at risk. I find it appalling that flights are not cancelled in advance by WizzAir (given specific lockdown instructions set by the government) and that passengers are required to cancel the flights more than 14 days prior to the flight so that the cancellation fees are not increased. It is absurd to charge the cancellation fee per person per flight and not per booking, meaning that the customer receives a 10th of the price paid. Based on the information I received from the WizzAir staff, the flight cancellation period varies from 2 weeks to 1 day. This means WizzAir deliberately does not adhere to WHO and Government (country specific) guidelines and restrictions, so that they can retain most of the price paid by customers when booking flights. Aside from this blatant disregard for pandemic restrictions, the customer service personnel was rude and dismissive over the phone, with no willingness to discuss the options available for customers. When I was given the information relating to the cost of cancellation, the call handler was abrupt and repeatedly asked me ""Should I cancel this or not?"" without allowing me the time to process the information received and to calculate/ understand how much will all this cost.",negative,-0.827218,1,17,6.605298,-6.357842

Majority of the airlines out there, including low budget ones, waved their cancellation and rebooking fees more than a month ago. It seems that Wizz Air is trying to make ""the best"" out of the current situation and prefers to fly with empty planes, thus more CO2 emissions, overtaking reasonable actions and providing fair customer service.

I use wizzair every year to go to Sofia to see my family and every time I get fucked up. If it is too big a bag, a problem of online check-in I find myself paying up to 70€ more. Sometimes to pass online check-in you have to select seats on the plane, but you have to pay 35 € / person. This time, because the plane was advanced one day, there were problems with online check-in. My husband and I decided to go to the airport earlier to avoid paying the fees. But there again we had to pay € 70 to print our tickets! A shame ""We understand but there is nothing we can do the service is blocked"". In addition to uncomfortable planes, barbaric schedules, absent customer service, there are delays and cancellations every time. And in the end we pay as much as a normal first class plane. Wizzair is the worst experience every time. They make every trip painful.  Wizz Air est à chaque fois la pire expérience!

Si c’est un sac trop grand, un problème de check-in online je me retrouve à payer jusqu’à 70€ en plus. Parfois pour réussir le check-in online il faut sélectionner des places dans l’avion, mais il faut payer 35€/personne. Cette fois, parce que l’avion a été avancé d’un jour, il y a avait des soucis de check-in online. Mon mari et moi avons décidé d’aller plus tôt à l’aéroport afin de ne pas payer les frais. Mais là à nouveau on a dû payer 70€ pour imprimer nos tickets! Une honte « Nous comprenons mais on ne peut rien faire le service est bloqué ». En plus des avions qui sont inconfortables, des horaires barbares, un service client absent, on a, à chaque fois des retards ou des annulations.

I contacted the airlines in the next day and until today I didn’t receive the compensation as per the EU regulations. I was accused of not showing up at the counter to take the denied boarding form. This is not true because I showed up in the counter and was given back the check-in money in cash. In addition, I was granted a one night stay at the airport’s hotel and the officers clarified to me to claim the compensation online. So how can I not show up in the counter and take these? I understand that an overbooked flight can just happen but what is not accepted is to spend 40+ days sending several emails to get the compensation. At the moment I am not sure if this review will move something yet I think that when someone reads this will definitely think twice before booking with Wizzair.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sofia to Luton,Feb-20,1,4,1,1,1,2,2,no,2,"  Wizz Air never seems to stop surprising with its tendency of maximising their profit and reducing their service quality at the same time.

And despite doing everything in the same way as before each time I failed to have all my family sitting together when opting for the automatically allocated seats. And I’m not talking about being split by isle or next row but 5-6 rows apart. So now the only way to have all of us sit together is by paying a premium of 17 Euros per person each way which adds nearly 140€ to our already high fares (half term craze)! I could be listing all minor issues with Wizzair for hours but another major one is the ridiculously low luggage allowance they call “free on-board baggage” which really only allows you to have a small backpack or ladies purse. The only way around it is guess what (?) paying around £50 extra to have a 20kg checked-in bag or purchase priority service which then gives you the same allowance you’d get with every other airline in the world. Finally just to show how bad their service is, when we were being transferred back to Sofia airport and been asked which terminal we’d be flying from, there was no way of getting this information from neither the Wizzair emails, their ticket or even their website. Instead we had to google it and verify from a 3rd party website which is just a joke!

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Luton to Tirana,Jan-20,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,no,1," London Luton to Tirana. I would give 0/10 but that is not an option. The size of the hand luggage is ludicrously small for one piece. When booking I bought the extra size. I was then annoyed to see at the check in those who had larger than the allowed size were being let through without having to pay more, some had two or three bags. The staff were mentioning it was too big to some but letting them through anyway, some they were charging. If the policy is to allow bigger bags fair enough but what is really unfair is my bag was only slightly bigger than the allowed size, so why did others not have to pay for bigger and I did? (I took pictures to prove it). I complained about this via the form on the website and the response had nothing to do with the complaint. I replied saying this and they said it was too late now. Their number is really hard to find but I called and was told I would be transferred, I was put on hold for 20 minutes and then they cut me off. I called back, no apology, I was told someone would call me back that day, a week later nothing. I left messages on twitter, they ignored them – although they “liked” a reply to one of my messages which suggested I called them again, so they were aware but not bothered to try and resolve it. I kept on leaving messages on twitter, eventually they told me to call the number I originally, although that was a battle to get it from them. I called and was told no one on that number could help and as for the lack of service he wouldn’t apologise “as it was nothing to do with him”. He didn’t listen to what I was saying but eventually said he would escalate it and I would get an email – which is rubbish by this point. Over a week later nothing. I am now far more angry about the way they deal with their customers, they seem to want to aggravate them, rather than resolve issues. They put down so many hurdles in the hope we will give up – they just want to take the money and not have to worry about us. It’s a real shame as they could have resolved this in one email, but instead they have proven they just don’t care about their customers.",negative,-0.818624,1,17,6.605298,-6.357842

At first thought it was a good airline and no complaints but now seems to be going down hill very rapidly. Airline staff good but check in staff rude and customer services absolutely appalling. Had so many issues this year so far and it’s only February. I know all airlines reschedule flights but we’ve had six flights changed already and it was an absolute nightmare trying to rebook them. The app wouldn’t let us book and customer services were rude and unhelpful. Took us many attempts speaking to different customers services operators to get it done. We also had to change our parking at the airport which we’d booked with Wizz and ended up being out of pocket by £80 but as Wizz said to us that is not their problem. They just don’t care. After all that stress and having to change leave at work I have now just had another email from them telling me they’ve rescheduled the flights all over again and on top of that I’ve just spoken to customer services and they’re saying I haven’t paid for one of my flights which is untrue. You couldn’t write this stuff! Just a word of warning to all. The number they give on their app for customer services is £1.45 per minute.,negative,-0.849792,0,16,7.923457,5.642262

We have bought 4 small bags specifically for this trip with a maximum of 6 kg as described (same size as a backpack, but very small trollies). Nevertheless the weight and size didn't matter to checkin staff and they made us pay another 65 euros, since they were not a backpack and looked like trollies. For what reason does Wizzair have weight and size restrictions if they don't stick to . Arriving at the Gate, without any seats assigned we went to the lady at the gate, who told us that the flight is overbooked and we will have to wait until the end with our 2 little kids to see if they can take us. The screen at the gate showed families with children have priority boarding (didn't look like). At the end only my wife was able to board the plane, and I was left behind with my two kids. The third party handling agent at the gate told us to leave the terminal and go outside to the 3rd party ticket counter to get alternative plans. This did dot happen since the had to booked another ticket online at the gate to catch a flight VIE-BCN-AGP, which airline was able to accept us at the gate with bags and without additional costs for checkin and luggage.

The stewardess was really helpful when asked if it was ok to sit together in the empty seats. Then we travelled back 3 days later and found that the flight was on time and it was almost as though we were flying with a different Airline. Exactly the same situation occurred, many empty seats. We asked the same question to the Stewardess ""Flora"". She was so rude that I was shocked at how someone could be so rude in public whilst working for a company that prides itself on having repeat customers and giving good service. She offered the wide leg space seats for 15 Euros per seat. She said she just follows Wizz Air policy. We asked ""How can Wizz Air policy be valid in one direction but not the other?. She didnt answer our question. She then said we can sit next to each other but not with the extra leg room. Then we started searching for other seats and she made no attempt to offer us any help at all. Others customers who were embarrassed by her behaviour offered us their help. Has this woman never heard of Customer Service. I had thought this was a service business. The seats could not have been sold as we were already in the air. This Stewardess was an embarrassment to Wizz Air. She attempted to publicly embarrass us both for asking the question and so many other customers could see this and offered us help themselves.

I paid for those services for 4 tickets: myself, my wife, my two daughters. We did not receive that service. On check-in the ""PRIORITY CHECK-IN"" line did not get priority. It was actually 3 times longer than the check in line for passengers that did not pay for Wizz Priority. We got lowered priority. This was because Wizz had twice as many check-in staff attending to non-priority customers as priority customers, even though there were more priority customers in line. At the gate, there was no priority in boarding. Everyone was called to board at the same time. We were not called first for boarding and received no precedence. I complained in person, and in writing. Here is Wizz Air's response: ""We are sorry to hear about this unfortunate situation and would like to assure you that we are doing our best to handle all customer inquiries in a timely manner.

Of course, I paid for my carry-on that goes in the overhead compartment and it fully corresponds to the measures and weight of Wizz Air policy and which was previously accepted on my inbound flight. I am told since I did not leave my luggage at check-in, the supplement is inevitable, so I agree to pay. I am directed to a second employee and now she is ordering me to put my purse in my carry on otherwise she will charge me 60€! I am shocked because this second extra is totally unjustified. I then ask for explanations for these fees, her rude answer: If you refuse to pay, a stand-by will be happy to take your place! I say a second time that I do not refuse to pay the 60€, but I wish explanations why I should 1) Pay my carry-on a 2nd time 2) Pay my little purse which is clearly indicated as free on your website.

Nowhere in the online booking process or emails was this made clear. In fact the opposite. It appears to be an intentional extortion technique. 3) We were told to leave the queue, pay the fine, and then queue all over again, even if it meant missing our flight. And that there was no other option. 4) The young girl on the check-in counter was incredibly rude and obnoxious, treating us like petty criminals. 5) When we finally got back to a check-in counter after paying the fine and re-queuing, another young girl forgot to print out our boarding passes before sending us on our way. ""Oh yeah, I forgot"" she said, when we asked ""shouldn't we have boarding passes?"". Pathetic. Even if you argue that we should have checked in online (we didn't because we'd already paid extra for our seats so assumed we could simply check in at the airport, as standard, since it absolutely was not made clear), the size of the penalty (€35 each) is extortionate, it was vindictive and cruel to make us queue all over again after a 1 hour wait, their spiteful attitude was horrible, and they displayed incompetence and disorganisation at every stage.

When I arrived at the gate for this flight we were informed that the flight was delayed but unfortunately no passenger announcement was made to explain why. When I asked the employee at the gate they told me that the expected delay would be an hour. An hour later, we were told that our flight would depart from a different gate and we made our way to the alternate gate. We then waited another hour with no announcements made before the boarding process commenced and we were able to get on the buses. It was only once we had boarded our aircraft that we were told that the delay had been caused by a maintenance issue and that the pilot's windscreen had now been repaired. I understand that safety is paramount but I was still frustrated by the lack of information on the ground. If we were given a more accurate delay time and and actual reason for the delay back at the gate I would have been content. We finally departed 2.5 hours after our estimated time of departure. Also, the boarding process was hectic and the ground staff should have been more clear regarding priority boarding. The announcements that they did make were unintelligible and could not be heard. I would fly Wizz Air again as they are cost effective and their overall onboard product is good, but it does have to improve upon the ground service that it offers.",negative,-0.364117,0,16,7.923457,5.642262
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Skopje to Turku,Aug-19,2,4,,,,1,1,no,2,"  We traveled from Skopje to Turku and a day before inbound flight we decided to upgrade our check-in baggage from 10 kg to 20 kg. That was a huge mistake because as we did so, we were no longer able to do online check-in or any changes to our reservation because status was no pending payment. We were bit unsure if we even were supposed to do online check-in because no head-ups email about online check-in ever came. We kept checking if status would change, but it didn't. When we arrived at airport a desk person said that transaction didn't went through and we should have had done online check-in but because it wasn't our fault, it would be ok to pay only for the bag. We were super relieved, but soon she came back and said that actually because we didn't call their call center about the issue we should pay also check in fees and the bag. We tried to explain that we weren't aware that we should have contact call centre and even if did it would have cost us 15Eur +2,9EUR per minute as we weren't our home country at time and we weren't sure about online check-in. Originally upgrade was only 11 euros and we ended up paying 134 e. We knew that with wizz air has to be very careful to read conditions carefully, but we didn't expect at all that if their system doesn't work and you can't make online check-in by yourself they will still charge you. A desk person wasn't rude, but we felt that situation was really unfair to us. The flight itself was on time and went very well.

I would get notifications saying that booking was not found and that the password is incorrect. I changed the password but then it would say that I am already signed. I was trying for over 1 hour and then I was trying again the day of the flight. Surprisingly, everything started to work 2 hours before the flight.

The plane started get going three times in the first hour of waiting and we all thought that it was ready to flight. I am terrified when the plane takes off and lands and every time it started accelerating I thought we were taking off and I started praying to myself. It was just a torture and my stress levels hit the roof. I panicked so much that I decided to leave the plane. Children started screaming. We were not even offered a glass of water nearly three hours sitting there like prisoners. I left the plane after 2:45 hours and not sure how long more it was delayed.

They could have given people seats together in random places and charge for the option to choose the seats location. On the flight tickets it said we can fly with 10kg of luggage, so we brought 2 small luggage cases for the plane. When we were at the airport we found out that we can only bring small backpacks with 10kg, not small luggage cases. This was not explained anywhere when we bought the tickets. We had to pay 100 Euro to fly with our small luggage cases on both flights. And we gave up the option to travel with a big luggage case like we always do because it was too expensive to add this option. After paying the extra 100 Euro the flight tickets were more expensive than other airline companies we could have chosen. These things should have been clearly explained to us before we bought the tickets. There was no free service, all service costs an additional fee. I knew the food on the plane would be for an extra fee. But they didn't even offer people a glass of water.

You only get priority when boarding the bus and at the gate, when they do the check-in, not when boarding the aeroplane like one may think. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful, the outbound flight was extremely smooth, no turbulences at all, the returning one had a few moments where it was slightly shaky. Yet, it was all good. The online check-in process was very easy. Be aware that if you do not check-in online, you pay a fee for the airport check-in. As for the luggage again, they even let this woman with a bag that clearly exceeded their dimensions limit in the cabin. Maybe she got lucky. Overall, I would fly Wizz again and I will in December, the same route. Absolutely love it. No “hidden” or “extra” fees as long as you read their rules carefully.

We arrived to check in to see a mass of people not in structured queues as there were more than double the amount of people for the standard queue barricades they had set up. It was a funnel effect of a large mass of people trying to jam in to one small entry line with no direction from surrounding staff who were simply standing there. Nobody was taking initiative. I asked a staff member where exactly we should be queuing for our flight and she directed us to 3 counters further down. We waited in the queue for half an hour. Then a different staff member asked if I was priority. I said no. She said I need to move to the next line. Turns out two lines are standard and one is priority however we weren’t told that and the priority line was written in small writing at the front counter at the bottom of the screen. After this staff member turned several people to the correct queue I suggested to her she could go through the very large line and check with people before they spend half hour in the line only to get to her and be told it’s the wrong line. She did this and subsequently 80% of the line had to move as they were also told the wrong thing. There were a lot of angry people. We then queued for another half hour in the right line only to get to the counter and the boy behind the counter to say he could not check me in. Because I hadn’t checked in online. When in actual fact my partner who booked my ticket with his on the same booking could not book me in online. He tried several times but the website seemed to not allow it. This was an IT issue not our fault however we were being penalised by being made to now pay for a ticket to be issued. We were sent to a different desk. The guy changed some things in the system. He said due to booking through an external booking provider it causes glitches in the system and I was not in my partners booking despite having a confirmation email and having paid for my ticket. He said next time to book direct. If external booking systems don’t work, then don’t allow people to buy a ticket through them?!we then had to go back to the same counter, explain to other customers why we were pushing in and then explain to the original boy that we were permitted to continue. Of which he questioned.we then only just make it to boarding and stand inline for 20 mins before another staff member who had been looking at everyone’s bags pulled me aside to say my carry on was too big. He waited til almost everyone had boarded before pulling a select few aside to charge for bags. Mine was literally 5cm over the bar: after 20 something flights this is the first time I have been stopped.my bag fit under the seat!!! This delayed the flight further due to people having to unexpectedly pay for luggage that was not questioned upon check in. Absolutely appalling, service lacking severely in initiative and customer service. Never again.",negative,-0.803752,0,16,7.923457,5.642262

Every flight I have taken has been delayed to some extent: the shortest delay I can recall was of 20 minutes; the longest was of about 2.5 hours. My flight on 2nd July was delayed by 1.5 hours. Wizz Air has used a variety of excuses when apologising in the aircraft for the delay in taking-off and arrival so it's not even worth repeating them. There is no point passengers and potential passengers trying to identify the reasons why this company seems incapable of taking-off and landing at the correct time, particularly on certain routes and particularly from Luton. The cabin crew on all my flights have been polite and professional but they too have seemed jaded and worn-down by the lack of on-time performance; after all, a flight that lands at 2.30am (instead of at the scheduled midnight) means a very late arrival home for the crew as well. The standard crew comment that ""this is aviation and you have to expect such things"" is now becoming the company's mantra. I don't care that Wizz Air charges for all types of luggage after the first small personal item; I don't care that I have to pay for seat selection as well as for food and drink; nor do I care much about the cleanliness of the exterior and interior of the aircraft. At the end of the day, I want what most people want: I want to arrive at my destination safely and at the time shown on the timetable. I regard Wizz Air as safe but, in my experience, the chances of arriving on time at a destination are, sadly, not very high.",negative,-0.676757,0,16,7.923457,5.642262

Wizz seats are not fine. In-flight catering options are slightly overpriced and not very appetizing. The rest was positive. Toilets are available and clean, no lines. Cabin was clean.

On the same flight, half of the passengers who had to board had the same problem as us because the website was not working. As they did not want to miss their flight they were obliged to pay. As soon as we landed I complained to Wizzair online. Next day, I received a reply just copying and pasting their terms and conditions.

I replied back saying that I do not want copying and pasting paragraphs, I want a reply from the highest manager as her email was not addressing all my points and she showed no remorse. I received a second reply next day and again it was from her (they seem to not have a manager at all). At the end she wrote the following: "" I would like to inform you that Wizz Air has exhausted its internal complaint handling process"" which shows that I should not bother them anymore and as she mentioned in her previous email again ""no refund"".

While I have nothing special to say about the onboard staff (they were neither nice nor rude, almost non-existent, I would say), I was appalled about the attitude of the Wizzair staff at the airport. First of all, the boarding gate did not appear on the display for long time (even though we were very close to the departure time). When it finally did, the number was accompanied already by a flashing ""BOARDING"" sign which put pressure on us. The gate was A17 so we followed the signs and at one point the signs indicated a direction for gates A12 - A19. Here it's when I noticed, on the side, a Wizzair staff screaming something which I could not understand so I went to her asking what is that she was saying and she was extremely rude and basically shoved us (not indicated) to another Wizzair staff (would have not been easier to put a sign akin to ""A12 to A19 except Wizzair passengers"" rather than having that rude woman screaming?"". So we went to this other person, this time a man who was checking the boarding passes and the size of the backbags without ever lifting his head and with the utmost scary expression. He sent me on one queue while my friends to another. When I asked him why, even though we were on the same flight, he sent us on two different queues, his brusque reply was: ""There is a difference, just go"". Is this a normal reply to someone who is asking you something? To a customer? I fully understood that it deeply bothers them when someone ask them a question, silly or clever that it may be, they just don't want question. I wonder why they chose this job and why there are allowed to treat people this way.

Don't understand how they keep changing the rules to suit themselves and not the customers. The staff are so rude and not very helpful at all, you have to pay and that it. No apology or explanation. Don't fly with this airline. Pay a little more and use another airline as they will always find another charge to hit you with.

Following an aborted landing due to bad weather (understandable if due to safety reasons, although other flights managed to land 30 mins before and afterwards), we were redirected to Stavanger in south Norway, two thirds of the way back to our starting point. There were many airports on the way that we could have stopped at instead (Trondheim, Narvik, Alesund, Bergen, Oslo, the list goes on) so we knew there was something not right going on, and were given minimal updates throughout (for example, where Stavanger was). Two hours after landing there, we were told that we were being returned to Luton and there was no other option. There was no reason for this redirection all that way except that the airline knew they needed the plane in the morning for other flights, and lied to the passengers about the reason. They could have put us up in Oslo/Trondheim/Alesund/Bergen etc and returned to Tromso early the next morning - surely that is easier and cheaper for them in fuel costs than having to take an entire plane back to London and then put on an entirely new flight the next day?",negative,-0.749447,0,16,7.923457,5.642262

The flight to Krakow left on time and the boarding process was very straightforward and pleasant. On my return flight from Krakow to London the flight left with a 15 minute delay, however this was due, to the need to de-ice the plane before departure, which was announced by the captain promptly as soon as every passenger was on the plane. Despite the delay we managed to get to London on time without any problems. Like all budget airlines, Wizz Air was limited in offering snacks and drinks, however this is very normal considering the cost of the flight, infact train tickets sometime cost twice as much.

He explained multiple times that he had wine in his luggage and couldn't take it through security. They were adamant for him to take it, and of course security stopped him. Then we waited an absurd amount of time to board. The employees were stopping people with a purse and luggage carry on and making them go back to the check in gate and through security. You've got to be kidding! No wonder they were 30 mins late and took way too long to board! They also don't even offer water or pretzels/peanuts on the plane. All paid.

I assumed that Wizz Air does not have online check in functionality or it was broken. When at the airport, I got asked to pay the sum of 33 GBP at the airport for failing to online check in. Given the airline's unwillingness to email people about checking in online and having a confusing and poor website UX that does not bring people instantly to the online check in page, reeks to me of a money grab.

Wizz Air wasn't the cheapest but they had the flight with the most appropriate timing for my group on that day. After booking and receiving the itinerary, we received many emails from them, ranging from flash sale offers to baggage allowance changes (this detail is important for later). We got to the check-in counter more than 2 hours before our flight but were told that we had to pay 35 Eur per person because we didn't do our check-in online. Our tickets were only 55 Eur per person, which means the check-in fee is more than half the price of the tickets. Right after being told that I had to do my check-in online or via the app at least 2 hours prior to the flight, I quickly downloaded the app and tried to do my check-in. All I got was an error message saying that due to baggage allowance changes, check-in via the app was no longer possible. While waiting in line to pay for the ridiculous fees, I went through every single email sent to me by Wizz Air; I read every word of the fine prints. There was not a single mention of the fee. When I got back to the hotel, I went through the emails 3 more times, still didn't find anything. I emailed Wizz Air (which btw was a long shot because their website says that they will take up to a month to respond any email and that phone calls to their centers would cost ridiculous amounts, even if you call from within the same country). They responded by saying that I should have read their T&Cs. Here's the thing, their T&Cs is 29 pages long with 16,000 words.

The three of us were placed in seat a and c in one row and the last person somewhere else. When we boarded the plane, of course they have placed a person in the b seat. The same happened on the return flight, even if the plane was far from full. I do not like their way of getting more money out of every ticket. The flight is short 1.5 hours, so it is no problem to sit in a narrow seat with your knees in the seat in front of you. We left in the evening on a cold day in Norway, the plane was full, and every passenger had jacket and pullovers. The crew put the heating system to maximum, i do not know why, maybe to make it uncomfortable for their passengers.

In occasions like this, the airline does not provide the necessary service to support passengers reach the desired destination as soon as possible. In principle, if a flight has been cancelled, the airline should provide the same flight to passenger at the soonest possibility. But  this is not the case with Wizz Air! My flight was cancelled and each passenger had to rebook him/herself the flight for another, already existing one, for which there are any free seats left. This means, some passengers may get to the desired destination in a couple of days, which is ridiculous! Also, for the time until the new flight, the passengers are not offered a full compensation for the accommodation expenses that occurred. In case WIZZ AIR is unable to perform the cancelled flight due to their lack of spare machines and makes people look for which flight there are any free seats left (limitation of their aircraft and service), they should take over all days the passengers are forced to book a hotel for!

When you book the ticket (and I have booked so many times flight tickets with different companies), there is not any message saying that the self check in online is mandatory. The way of wording for the online check in, is similar to the rest companies as usual saying that :the online check is available two or some days before the flight and if you like you can check in online by yourself to avoid the waiting time at the airport, but nowhere is clearly stating that you must check in by yourself. This is too obvious, that the company is just trying to find ways to earn additional money. It would be way better, to just increase your fares and include the implicit services within the fare. This is the most ridiculous charge I have ever paid to an air company. Other than that, we have been advised that our cabin luggage couldn't been carried onboard the plane to the normal cabin storage place, because we didn't book our ticket with priority boarding and there should be an extra charge if we wanted to take our luggage with us.

My gate number didn't pop up on the screen until the  moment we were boarding. We all made a mad dash towards our gate, which was the same area as three other planes. Once we make it through, we go down a hallway and outside, looking for the name of our destination. Then they keep us in this little hallway until we're all there. After this, we go down another hallway, this one very outside, and pretty cold. I watched as the old passengers were taken off our plane, their luggage transportive, and then waited even longer for them to clean the plane (I can only hope). I'm not sure why I had to wait outside, and for so long, when the plane wasn't ready for us. This is  the only airline I've ever felt possessed to complain about.

✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Warsaw to London,Oct-18,2,1,1,1,1,4,2,no,2," Today, I had THE worst experience of my life on Wizz Air. I arrived early for boarding so that I could find room for my backpack in the overhead compartment - which I did. I then took my row 'C' aisle seat. After boarding was completed, I was made to remove my backpack by the stewardess and force it under the seat in front of me. My backpack is large, flexible and within Wizz Air's size limits, but placing it there meant that there was no room left for my feet. (See photos). I could not place my feet outside in the corridor area, either as it would have tripped other passengers who were walking and blocked the food trolleys. I had no choice but to place my feet under the metal braces in the seat in front, meaning that every time the passenger in front moved in his seat, my foot would get crushed. By the end of the flight my foot was bruised, and I was in pain, simply because my bag was too large to fit under the seat, and it should have been left in the over head compartment. Upon pointing this to the stewardess who instigated this episode without any consideration of the consequences, she told me to write to Wizz Air and complain, and that there was nothing she could do. It may be that Wizz Air will read this and decide to reply, stating that shortly larger bags, such as the one which I had to remove mine for will not be allowed without an extra fee. However, that is not the point. At the time of my journey, this was allowed, and. Wizz Air provided zero safe foot space. My bag was also too large to fit under the seat in front, and should have stayed in the overhead locker. Additionally, as my bag was too large to fit the seat in front, it was blocking the emergency escape route of the passengers sitting in the window and middle rows. This is dangerous, and I believe against passenger air transport safety rules. There were also a couple of other, issues regarding hygiene. I noticed that the toilets were cleaned by cabin crew, without wearing gloves, using paper towels from inside of the toilets. First the seat was wiped, then the sink and finally the same towel was dropped on the floor and the floor was wiped using the shoes. The stewardess then pick up the papers from the floor using her hands and flushed them down the toilet. After this, and without washing her hand, she walked to the food trolley and started serving food to passengers, touching coffee cups, water bottles, serviettes and sandwich wrappers. This has to be the worst case of hygiene which I have ever come across, and I would not trust any food served on this airline. I also noticed that the headrests on the seats had grease marks on them, as the paper headrests were missing. The Velcro exists to hang the headrests from, but in order to save costs, it seems like Wizz Air have decided not to care about this item either. I have travelled on Wizz Air on numerous occasions in the last 10 years or so (about 10 times this year alone), however the service has reduced dramatically, the prices have any rocketed (they are often more expensive than national carrier National carriers) and the staff's attitude to customers is simply atrocious - possibly due to their fast expansion. Because of a staff members attitude, the poor and dirty hygiene, over crowding, and bad value for money, I will not travel on Wizz any more, and I recommend that you check the prices of other airlines before booking with Wizz Air.",negative,-0.721396,0,15,7.748934,4.820282

Once we approached the boarding gate, one woman stopped me and asked me to put my hand luggage inside the measurement box. It turned out to be bigger and didn’t fit inside. She then asked me to pay a fee of 75€ extra. I also had a small backpack for my laptop and camera which she said was too much. I said that I would give it to my mom since there were 4 of us. She then stopped us all and forced us to squeeze all our stuffs (even food, clutches for money/passports/boarding passes) inside 4 hand luggage only (including the one I had already paid 75€ for). 3 out of these 4 luggage were to be put to the side of the cargo separate from us since the plane was full.

Wizz Air used to be a small airline with nice fares and helpful and friendly staff. They have recently expanded in a short period of time, and I believe this is where the problem lies. I have had 3 errors while making three different bookings in the last 2 months. I travel between university and home approximately every 2 months, and sometimes my family visit so you can imagine, there are a lot of bookings. No benefits whatsoever - no collecting airmiles, no benefits for frequent travellers. You have to buy a membership to get cheaper flights but nothing apart from that. The website is ridiculous. For example, last month (Sept 2018), I used my bank card for a booking and at the end of the transaction, I received an error notification that the bank card did not work and I was instructed to repeat my transaction again. A phone call came and I did not manage to try immediately. 2 minutes later, I receive an email with a summary of my booking because the transaction was actually complete! So luckily, I had not tried a second time. Another example (Sept 2018) is when I tried to add 2 suitcases to an inbound flight. But instead, they were added to the outbound flight! That is 2 suitcases of 20kg, so I am still waiting for my refund of almost £50. No emails from Wizz Air yet. I have travelled with Wizz Air for 5 years now, it used to be an affordable airline, simple way to get from A to B. Now each booking comes with a problem. Each time I am on the website, it feels like I am gambling today. Am I going to end up losing £50 or will everything go well maybe this time? I am a student, so it is really difficult.

On the way to Greece a woman asked to sit in an extra legroom seat two seats from me and was allowed to, so maybe it's not necessary to pay extra for that if you travel alone. My only complaints would be: confusion about the baggage allowance meant I worried a lot about whether I could take my small bag on the plane (I was allowed, but according to their rules I should have been fined as I didn't have Priority), and the check-in desk was very slow to open at Athens, so a long queue formed.

I was treated like an idiot because I had not figured out that online check-in was needed while apparently having ""ticked the box"" to agree to do it online while booking. Apparently I would have figured this out by logging into their website. As if I had nothing better to do with my time than browsing their website just for fun.

They didn't care and lied that it will not necessary go to drop off, the flight attendant will hold them only if there will be no more space in the cabin. It was a lie because we were among the first to board and they took the luggage to the drop off. The places for luggage in the cabin were almost empty near our seats, so it was only mockery what they did. Besides that we had to wait at 3:30am half an hour for the luggage. Another problem is that the space in the seat is too small. I have 1.7 meters height and I stood with my knees stuck in the front seat. I cannot imagine how taller persons can fly 3 hours in that tiny place. Conclusion: never, ever flight with this joke of company, they have the absolute worst service I ever experienced.

The next day I went to the airport about 3 hours before departure, queued up at the check-in desk, only to be refused a ticket because “I had not checked in online”. I was told in no uncertain terms that unless I paid 35 EUR I would be denied boarding. The fact that their website did not work and that they had not at any stage advised of the need to check in – unlike Ryanair (who emailed and texted me a day before the flight), did not serve any purpose and I was forced to pay. As Wizz doesn’t do customer service, their pathetic attempt to respond to my complaint was left to customer service whose final attempt to look into my complaint said “We would like to kindly inform you that we have done a thorough investigation and we are delighted to inform you about the reason, why you were requested to pay at the airport”.

Altogether there were over 15 of us traveling with Wizz Air to 2 destinations from Sibiu; Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Luton Airport.  We arrived at the airport, most of us, 2 hours before we were to depart. For local airlines this is quite normal. What we did not expect is what happened to all of us and needs to be addressed immediately. We checked in only to be told that we had not ""checked in online"" 3 or more hours before, so each of us would have to pay an additional 35 EUROS to get a seat. All 15 of us were charged this. This needs to be advertised as a crucial piece of information and not in the small print. I believe this is part of a money-making scheme with the airline and should be addressed. They smiled at us a lot after they told us to go to the counter to pay the additional monies and then when we returned they sort of looked at the scrap of paper and smiled again and said priority queue.

During that time we were on the plane for four hours, during which time a passenger deplaned for ""family"" reasons, an extensive security check was done on belongings in the plane, more passengers wanted to deplane (apparently scared by the extensive security check) and then everyone had to deplane. We were hardly instructed on where to go on the way back to the terminal, ""go up the stairs"", and given no prior instructions on how re-boarding was to take place. In the commotion, five passengers, including me were left stranded in Budapest. For Wizz Air, we were automatically to be blamed, and had to pay for a new ticket if we wanted to reschedule. Perhaps the smart passengers stayed standing in front of the departure screens, but I was told that the plane was expected to take off at 11 PM. After missing dinner and not drinking for hours, I needed to sit down and try to cancel my Madrid hostel reservation online. Then much earlier than expected I heard an announcement. That was the only boarding announcement although two authorized agents stated that ""many"" were given. It didn't look like any information was given on the screens. The five that took a few minutes more to respond to the announcement could not pass a barrier that was no longer successful in reading boarding passes. There were no agents around that could help. Looking everywhere we asked an orange-clad worker to find someone who after his second call on his cell phone told us we were lucky, that we just had to wait right there at that spot because the airline had to change the crew. But, alas, nobody came for us. Then, to add insult to injury, we were told we had to pay again to reschedule. The other four did that. I refused and tried making all contacts possible to ask them to reconsider. After all, I would have expected that would be the correct thing to do. At this point I have plenty of reason to believe that I will not get my money back, like many before me.

Also checked in on line to ensure a trouble free departure and booked our cab to arrive early so we could get through and enjoy a coffee while we waited for departure.  So you would thing I did everything right? How wrong was I! On arrival at the Wizz Air check in, the queue was several hundred passengers deep, I pointed out to an official that all we needed to do was check in 1 bag ""join the queue"" was the terse reply. 55 minutes later, we finally arrived at the check in to be told that our on line check in did not apply, and we had to go the whole procedure again. Wizz Air did not have have enough staff at the check in counters. While 12 desks were ""open"" only 6 were manned....absolutely pathetic service. The end result was a rush to the departure gate, only to find that everyone was ""herded"" into a departure lounge that had seating for less than 10% of passengers. Priority boarding passengers were lined up outside the terminal and had to wait in the hot sun (it was an unusually warm English day) while the delayed incoming aircraft was refueled, resulting in several having to force their way back through the queue to get some shade. Altogether a complete shambles. What about the flight I hear you say! The cabin crew were awesome, friendly and helpful.

Upon making the initial booking, the check in didn’t include my middle name on the boarding pass. I’m aware this can be quite problematic, as it doesn’t match my passport, so I called ahead to get this resolved. After waiting a substantial amount of time, the first operator put the phone down “by mistake.” The second updated the details but he made a huge typo, despite the characters in question are on the opposite ends of the keyboard and sound nothing alike - K for Kilo isn’t even remotely close to A for alpha. All in all, it took nearly 2 hours to resolve the issue. I’ve also checked in online for the return journey, as I wanted to sit beside my wife and the random seat generator sat us as far away as possible in order to force us to use the upselling option. I called to see if I could actually get this rectified and if need be, upgrade but the agent was so rude and smug, I actually got off the phone in a bad mood and decided against the upgrade. I won’t be using this budget airline ever again, as I’d rather pay more and receive competent and friendly customer service.",negative,-0.811503,0,15,7.748934,4.820282

Their attitude towards customers is disrespectful, with persistent attempts to increase the price after booking (pay to choose seats, deliberately splitting couples up on seat allocation, not being able to check in until 48 hours before departure - it took nearly 2 hours to enter passenger info and print boarding cards (this can be done well in advance on other airlines), having to put cabin baggage in the hold etc).

I fly with Wizz Air quite often due to their good fare offers and convenient routes. The seats are comfortable enough for a short-haul flight and I don't have a problem with legroom as I'm not very tall. The cabin crew was very friendly and courteous, as usual. What I don't like about them if that they make you check-in your hand luggage most of the time, if it's a trolley. Or they charge you for letting you take it on board. This is really annoying because you always have to wait for your hand luggage at the destination. This particular flight was quite bumpy. There's very little a pilot can do to avoid turbulent weather and I am not one to be easily scared, but this time the flight experience was a little unpleasant. No concerns over safety, though, so I will keep flying with them. The worst thing of all was the boarding experience at Otopeni airport (and the overall condition of the airport). This must be one of the worst, dirtiest and most crowded airports I have even been to and it's getting worse by the month.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vienna to Rome,Jul-18,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Vienna to Rome. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown on. Here are 3 reasons why: 1) They Charge you for everything. I mean everything. If you don’t have checkin completed before you get to the airport it costs $40 to get one there so you can fly (not an exaggeration). Printing the little piece of paper costs literally as much as the airplane ticket. In addition, there website is so sneaky and tricky that they won’t send an email asking you to confirm or anything. They will make it incredible you difficult to do so they can steal some more money. I had 5 different flights on this trip from several airlines and this was the only one I could not figure out how to check in and spend $40 on that. Also expect to get charged extra if you have any extra bags at all: purse, hand bag, etc. I wouldn’t be surprised if you got charged for entering the plane with gum in your mouth. 2) Staff will treat you poorly. Aside from being charged for everything and nit pick on everything; there is no management in the building to talk to if you have an issue b/c the company is so small they have to hire an outside source at the airport. The staff treats you like criminals checking everything and looking for any little thing they can charge you with. From there you’ll be driven on a bus shuttle to the plane. Literally they are some stingy that you have to sit in the back of the bus if you are not priority. This doesn’t even matter, but it’s just that type of scroungy feel to the whole experience that makes it misserable. 3) They delayed the flight twice overall. I’ve flown about probably 10 or 15 times to places all over the world. I have had some great ones and some rough ones, but this is by far the worst. I will probably never fly with Wizz Air again and I encourage anyone else reading this review to do the same. Pay a little extra because it will literally cost the same amount or less in the end anyway. Plus you’ll be able to at least carry one carry on safely with you to the airport.",negative,-0.745179,0,15,7.748934,4.820282

They told me I could ""try"" to get my travel to the airport refunded on their website. They said that it was my fault the other places would not refund me. The best part of it all was that they canceled the flight as I was going through security at the airport.

If an airline takes me from point a to point b safely, then I am satisfied. With this in mind, I never thought I would have such a dreadful experience with an airline. On the first leg from Tirana to Luton, I tried to check in via the Wizz Air app, however it explicitly said that I could not check in online due to regulations from Tirana's airport. I went to the check in counter the day of the flight and I was harshly told by a Wizz Air employee to pay the charge or leave the airport, even though I was clearly explaining to them that checking in online was purely impossible- they refused to listen. The first absolute scam from this airline. The second leg was an even more dreadful experience. Before boarding a woman started interrogating all passengers like she was a prison warden about the number of carry on bags they had. I was fine, however there were people who were forced to pay cash on the counter, just for carrying a lap top in their hands. Second absolute scam. The flight was supposed to take off at 6 a.m UK time, but it took off at 7:30 a.m. The reason was ""a missing oxygen bottle"" which had to be delivered from Gatwick Airport. To add to the misery, we were left to wait not even inside the terminal, but in the stairs leading to the tarmac, for about an hour. The air was humid and I started having difficulty breathing. Many older people had to lie down on the ground, and many children started getting ill. It seemed like a scene from an apocalyptic movie - at 6 a.m on a Tuesday morning in London! The flight itself was alright. I want to point out that the captain of the flight, an Irish gentleman, fully deserved the title as he apologised profusely on behalf of a ridiculous airline. Nothing but respect for him. Every single other Wizz Air employee, particularly the ground crew needs to take some lessons not just on their jobs, but also on basic human decency.

We tweeted Wizz air asking for an update and they sent us a link to a website that said our planes original take off time? Helpful- I think not. Pilot then tells the crew we are taking off still no apologies, no reason given but we did actually take off. The worst part was we had a late night flight and were meant to arrive at around 9.30pm. We landed just before 11.30pm and our check-in for our apartment stops at midnight. So we abandoned our original transfers to get a taxi so that we could arrive with 5 minutes to spare otherwise we'd have had to sleep on the street. We thought this might be a one off. But no. Flight home they got us all boarded onto the buses to go to the plane and then kept us there for an hour and a half, the website did actually say delays but then didn't update when it was delayed a further hour. We finally got to the plane and took off quite quickly this time. We landed home two hours late and our parking had expired. But at least on the way home they did finally apologize when we landed and said the 'airspace was busy' for two hours?

Uncomfortable, cramped seats, overcrowded (my cabin bag had to go into the hold), and really not that cheap for a budget airport.

I have complained directly to them to claim the european inconvenience payment of €400 per person and they claimed 'extraordinary circumstances' in both situations. We went through a law firm and they managed to get our payment for both cases. Recently, they have also changed the luggage on board rules and supposedly, they take all small hand suitcases to hold. We boarded the plane among the first 10 people and our suitcase was taken to hold. There were at least 30 suitcases (we counted, and we stopped counting after a while) which were taken on board after we boarded. So what is this s#1t? If only a certain number of suitcases are allowed on board, why don't they offer to allow people to check their hand luggage in advance? The staff have always been incredibly condescending and there seems to be a lack of training across the company as we have always been given contradicting explanations for the concerns we have raised.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Budapest to Bucharest,Mar-18,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Budapest to Bucharest. Our difficulties started long before we went to the airport. I noticed at home when I reviewed our ticketing information was that no seats were assigned. So I went online and discovered that to select seats you had to pay for any seat on the plane. Since it was only a bit over an hour flight we decided to let them randomly select our seats even if the three of us, including our 12 year old daughter, were not seated together. A few days before the flight I again went online and attempted to check in. The first section of check-in covered two items: the need to pay to have even one bag checked in (at the rate of $50 per bag) and their rule that there was no guarantee that you could even take one carry-on unless you were willing to pay $6 Euros per passenger for a pass - which supposedly also allowed you to board early. Since we had three bags to check-in and three bags to carry-on I paid over $170 online in order to avoid paying a higher price (as noted in the online check out info) at the airport. The next section of the online check in asked me to select our seats - again at a price. Already upset at the outrageous check-in bag cost I opted not to select a seat and the web site booted me out. I assumed I would just check-in at the airport counter and find out what seats were assigned to us by the airlines. Imagine our surprise when we were informed by the clerk at the counter that we had failed to complete the check-in process and therefore he could not issue tickets. He directed us to another Wizz Air counter down the hall where we were told that our failure to complete the online check-in process would cost us 40 Euro per passenger (120 Euros total) - we had no other option but to pay the 120 Euros. We then returned to the ticket counter and finished checking in. When we arrived at the gate we discovered that the $6 Euro pass we had purchased for each of us allowed us to board early - ya, right, on the bus which then took us to the plane. We stood in the bus for over 30 minutes waiting to be taken to the plane. Once the bus arrived it was a mad house getting off the bus and trying to board the plane.

Wizz Air answered ""that the page www.wizzair.com works properly and is constantly monitored by Wizz Air IT department and we have not recently made a note of irregularities and they did not accept my complaint.

They know many people won't have a printer in hand or simply will not know so. Unfortunately for them now they had to offer online checking instead, but they make you regret of it as you have to work feeling endless camps (only left asking where our mothers work for each passenger). I avoided that but then comes the flight. Flight got delayed as when boarding people was unboarded without info and rude manners on some ground personnel. In the end over 2 hours delay due to technical problems (but it could be whatever) When boarding with our baby (9 months) although we carry a Yoyo/Baby Grace babycar and its specifically for flying on cabin (that's why we bought it and even in other lowcost never posed problems) after a long discussion they made us to put it down as usual luggage.  The senior cabin crew didn't have any idea of her job about this. Sits can not be bended even 1cm. But I will be fair and say I had other low cost with less space for legs (which doesnt mean here you had more than just enough to survive being 185cm.

While on holiday I got an automated text from Wizz Air saying my flight had been changed and I would have got an email with my new flight details. There was no email, and my account showed I was still on the same flight. Looking on Facebook, a lot of people had this issue and Wizz Air admitted (on Facebook, where not many people would check) that the text was sent in error. This is after lots of people (according to their comments on Facebook) spent lots of money calling their premium number to check what happened to their flight (many waiting upwards of half an hour and many not even getting through!). I do wonder if that text was to encourage people to call the premium number for some extra revenue. My plane was the one I booked, albeit an hour late. As usual, Priority passengers had their passports checked and were allowed down to the shuttle bus to the plane. All other passengers (including me) were next. I was on the same bus as the Priority passengers (who were separated from us with a red cordon on the bus) and there were a few other buses behind us also going from the gate to the plane. We waited, standing, on the bus for over half an hour before it took us to the plane. What's worse (not for me, but for the Priority passengers) is the other buses left before us so ours actually got to the plane second last! Priority were the first to the bus and amongst the last on the plane. Aside from being fast-tracked through security at Budapest (which had no queue anyway), I saw no evidence of Priority adding anything. Once on the plane, staff were nice and obliging, and the plane was clean. Food is expensive but you can bring your own from the airport. Tea is 2.5 Euros but you can ask for extra hot water for free. The pilot gave detailed information on the route and weather. The boarding process is very painful and I don't remember a single Wizz Air flight being on time (and I have flown with them several times).

I was told by the staff that I actually needed their app to check in. This was not communicated when I bought the ticket. This wasn't just a problem with my family, as there was at least 17 other passengers on my flight who also had to pay the 35 euro per passenger fee to check-in.

Checkin at Malmo was efficient and polite (more so than many full service legacy carriers), the flight was great, immaculately presented new aircraft. Of particular note however was presentation, training and competence of the flight crew. The linquistic skills of one of the crew was extraordinary. This lady was able to communicate perfectly in English, Swedish and Macedonian. When the passenger sitting next to me was speaking a 4th language she asked his language then switched to Bulgarian without missing a step, importantly, with a smile. At the risk of drawing a conclusion from a sample of one, very impressed. Does Wizz pass the would I fly with them again test - yes.

If you join the Discount scheme you get good value for money and the premium package for frequent flyers is well worth it as seat selection etc is free when you pay the annual fee.  Priority boarding I have only had one negative experience and this was at Sofia airport on an internal flight, poorly organised but this is not usual for Wizz. The cabin crew are usually friendly although sometimes they are tired on late flights. On board service is good. Announcements from the flight deck are sometimes inaudible or heavily accented and of no use.

Since the plane was not full, I asked if it is possible to relocate my seat, because I would like to sit next to my spouse.

The Wizz webpages malfunctioned on first attempt, failing just before I expected a receipt for the luggage purchase. Ok, I thought, I'll try tomorrow, I'm sure its working again by then. Tried again the next day. Tried from two different computers, and one cell phone. Same malfunction. Thought that now they know about it, and its time to get to the airport. When the error has been there for days, it should be possible to handle it at the airport. Of course not, they dont acknowledge the error or their responsibility for having working webpage functions, when their whole service is surrounded on customers handling ordering etc. Customer service wont pay me back the airport fee of course, and only repeats its my own responsibility.

The plane was located quite far from terminal building but we weren't taken there by bus, we had to go on foot. The aircraft is very cramped, the flight was fully booked and there wasn't enough place for hand luggage onboard so many passengers had to put it under the front seat which is not comfortable at all. However, all aforementioned is quite acceptable for a low-cost carrier. But after take-off it became extremely hot and it was very difficult to breathe, almost all passengers continued coughing during the whole flight - I suppose there were some issues with air conditioning?

Priority passengers could get off first in Sofia. As a new rule from winter schedule 2017, without priority, your cabin luggage is hold at the gate without charges. If you have valuable things in a bag, staffs say to you to bring them only into the machine and staffs take your bag. As a priority passenger, I could bring 2 bags into machine. Therefore, overhead bin had enough room and it's possible on time operation.

Since we bought the tickets, 30 days earlier, we had tried to check-in online multiple times, at different hours, from different computers but due to Wizz Air’s site problems (in my opinion it was done deliberately) nothing worked. I’ve sent messages to Customer Relations and many other Wizz Air Departments, asking for help but they ignored all communication. I have record of all these messages, all the complaints. Reading online this is a regular occurrence. We were not the only people at check-in desk having similar problems. We paid 70 Euros in order to board the plane. When we got home I contacted Wizz Air Customer Relations. Wizz Air’s Customer Relations Department has responded that they are going to refund only 50% of 70 Euros, meaning 35 Euros.

It’s written in their T&Cs, if you care to waste your lifetime on reading their fine print.

When I informed them about this straight away they claimed that it was my fault for not clicking the discounted price. I told them that it wasn't the first time i'd used the discount and that I'm well aware of the process and they informed me without screen shots they were powerless. I informed them that I didn't want the money back as I go on several breaks a year, money off my next flight (which would be around €20) would be fine. They still didn't budge. Every flight I've had with them there has been problems that they are unwilling to sort out. They are cheap for a reason. Pay a little bit more, it'll be cheaper in the long run.

From all of the ones I know the seats of Wizz Air are the most uncomfortable, non adapted to human body. From 29 October, Wizz Air will change the politic about luggage, so space under the seat in fromt of you won´t be taken by your own luggage. Price of food is not so high, but quality is opposite.

I wasted over 5 hours because they failed to provide instructions in a language I could read. After canceling my flight, it's almost impossible to get a response from them in order to obtain the compensation I am entitled to. At the airport, the flight seemed to be delayed somewhat. At 9:45 am I got a message saying the flight had been canceled and I could rebook another one, with no further information. I tried to get information online but the WiFi had crashed under the increasing amount of people in the airport. After waiting in line at the information desk they told me they had no information at the time, but that the airport was closed and it wasn't due to the weather. When asking why the airport was closed, she simply replied: ""I can't tell you"", hinting that she knew, but I wasn't supposed to. After waiting around around for half an hour or so, they finally announced that we were allowed to leave the airport. I asked what that entailed exactly considering they were saying the flight hadn't been officially canceled, and they said I had to sign in order to receive further information. I asked to read the letter first, but they declined. I signed and received a letter in Hungarian which nobody was able to translate for me. Next they put me on a bus and dropped me off at the departure again. I was told to get in line where I'd paid the exorbitant airport check-in fee of 35 EUR earlier. It was a huge line which was hardly budging. Due to the enormous amount of people, I spent 2.5 hours waiting in line. When I got to the front, the lady told me she had no information. When I asked if there was anyone from Wizz airlines to talk to, she said she didn't know, and I had to queue up at the information desk which had a line of similar length. I expressed my doubts that they would be able to help me there and wanted to record her telling me that I had to go to the information desk so that they wouldn't send me right back. After standing in line for 30 minutes, I was told I had to go back to the place I just came from.

✅ Verified Review ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to Bucharest,Aug-17,3,3,,,,1,1,no,2,"  Tel Aviv to Bucharest. Not really low cost! Bad service turned it into a very expensive (and frustrating) experience for me and my family! I traveled with my wife and two children to Romania, and we were denied boarding at the gate of the flight back from Bucharest to Israel, because of overbooking. No matter how much we argued and insisted, we were refused. I must emphasized that at any stage there was no call for volunteers to give up boarding, as the EU regulation require in case of overbooked flights, before performing involuntary denial of boarding. The staff member at the gate told us that they are missing one seat, so 3 of us can travel. We explained that we cannot split. Only after we got back to the ticket office at the departure flights counters we were told that we are entitled only for a single denied boarding, as the 3 others had seats and chose not to fly. We had to buy new flight tickets for the next day in a different airline, as Wizz Air had no seats available in the following days. These one way tickets cost us more than the entire round trip with Wizz Air (although it was with another low cost airline). We had to pay for hotel another night, meals, transportation etc. I submitted a complaint and sent copies of all required documents and receipts. It took more than a month for Wizz Air customer service to respond, and their feedback is that they are willing to compensate me for denied boarding of only a single passenger. They provided very limited compensation for the other passengers. The overall compensation Wizz Air agreed for is €984, while my overall expenses caused by this denial of boarding was €2,426. Seriously, Wizz? We know that airlines overbook the flights, but compensate properly your customers when they are harmed by it! At least reimburse the actual extra expenses caused, I am not even talking about compensation for the frustration and trouble. Follow the regulations and ask for volunteers before you perform involuntary denial of boarding! Don’t split up families! If you deny boarding from a member of a family under a single reservation, compensate the entire family! None of us wanted to stay there. The youngest kid was crying, we all wanted to get home already, we had good reason that we explained that prevented us from splitting. Beware of Wizz Air.

When saving money isn't worth it, we all want a bargain but sometimes it's better to shell out a bit more than save money for an awful service. I booked a getaway on Groupon so if anyone reading this is in the same boat then I urge you to reconsider. Flying to Budapest the flight was delayed an hour and change with nothing resembling an explanation given, luckily the flight wasn't full so I could stretch out some but I could tell it would be uncomfortably cramped if anyone was sitting next to me, and I'm only 5'11 so I shudder to think how anyone over 6ft would fare. Then returning we find out much to out chagrin that we had to check in online, bear in mind no-one saw fit to inform us of this, not Groupon, the airline or the company we booked it through. And to make it worse me and my girlfriend were seated at opposite ends of the plane. The ground staff were of no help, not even attempting to help us find a solution let alone sympathise with our problems. So in summary, this airline may be cheap but if you have even a modicome of care for the pleasantness of your journey then I cannot recommend enough paying slightly more and flying with a reputable airline and I'm including easy jet and Ryanair so that should tell you something.

Since check in is done well in advance, and since I did not check in any luggage, I could pass the long lines and go directly to security. This was very convenient. If you don't want to pay extra you can only carry a small bag at this airline, but they make that very clear even in their advertisement, so it can hardly be a surprise for anyone. What is more annoying is that you cannot choose seats at check in without having to pay extra. Consequently I was placed in a middle seat, even though the aircraft was only half full. But the person next to me moved away quickly so I could move to the aisle seat. Seat comfort was not too bad, the seatbacks could not be reclined, but being tall I find it more annoying if people in front of me recline their seatbacks without looking back. The catering on board was very uniinteresting, and for someone who does not eat gluten there was hardly anything available. But I had brought my own food, so that was not a problem. All in all the flight was pleasant enough, and even though we were a bit delayed at departure we arrived in time.
