We were never informed of their monetise the baggage policy, until we arrived at the boarding gate, and could no longer transfer stuff into hold cases. My 76 year old wife was charged ?48 because her cabin bag, which she has used for years and years had become 1"" too long, because Easy Jet decided to cash in by making a new ""rule"". They have done this, knowing full well, and in complete contravention, of the decision by the European Parliament's Committee, to now enforce a cabin baggage rule made in 2014. The European Court of Justice refers to airlines' varied size and weight standards for hand baggage, hidden fees, and misleading consumers about the true cost of air travel. The explanation given, was that the bag was a flight safety hazard, in the event of the aircraft being evacuated. However, by paying Easy Jet ?48, the bag was no longer a flight safety hazard, apparently. The other explanation given was that it would not go under the seat, but would have to go in the overhead lockers, designed for that purpose. Which, of course, was exactly what always happened before Easy Jet changed their rules. Incongruously, prior to take off, cabin crew (quite correctly) ask for any significant items to be stored in the overhead locker. Now, if that isn't misleading and monetising customers, then I don't know what is. Easy Jet may seem like a cheap option. It isn't. If you have a problem, and there are often problems travelling, Easy Jet will do nothing to help you. Better, much better, simply fly with a reputable airline. Superficially, it might appear a few pounds more; but, when you need customer service, you are much more likely to get it.",negative,-0.618626,0,29,8.552367,5.783825
? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hurghada to Gatwick,24-May,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,3,"  I have been travelling for 5 years, between Hurghada/Gatwick, approx 7 - 8 times per year. I am sick to death of this airline, but unfortunately have no other option of another direct flight, since WizzAir stopped their flights. I need wheelchair assistance which I always book in advance, yet, I am never provided with the service they claim they can provide. The wheelchairs provided in Hurghada airport are all broken & on arrival 3 weeks ago, I was dumped on a seat at the far end of the arrivals corridor & completely abandoned for 35 minutes, until the pilot & crew came past & asked if I was OK. I explained the situation & they kindly went to find a porter with another wheelchair to rescue me. The porters always demand a tip & often rummage through my purse, dictating to me which notes they will take for this 'free special assistance service', whilst also asking me for some of my painkillers, pens, sweets etc. The porters only provide a wheelchair service after you have queued to get into the airport, queued to have your passport check, queued to get through the first x-ray & bag/body searches, 2nd bag search & checked your bags in. They only wheel you to the gate, not down the gangways to the plane, so you are left standing in queues to board the plane for 30 - 45 minutes. My flight back from Hurghada on Sunday 26th May was delayed for over 26 hours & absolutely no special assistance was provided at all to disembark the plane, when the pilot decided to abort take off. I was left to struggle all the way back through the airport again & onto a bus which drove us all the way out to a hotel in Sahl Hasheesh, then struggle to offload my luggage from the bus & in the pitch black, at 4am, all round the huge hotel complex, to my room. No Easyjet rep made an appearance & I only knew when the bus was coming to pick us up to take us back to the airport, through rumours from other passengers. It is also infuriating that on every flight back to the UK from Hurghada, they never have any food. Only 7/10 flights to Hurghada have food available. I am diabetic & had arrived at Hurghada Airport at 6pm for my 8.45pm flight on Sunday. The 1st delay was apparently due to the plane arriving late from the UK. The 2nd delay was apparently due to a crew member being sick & the 3rd delay, was due to a technical issue with 2 of the 3 plane's communication systems as we were taking off. We were all sat on the plane, on the runway for over 2 hours, with no food or drink, only half a plastic cup of warm tap water each. We reached the hotel we were bussed to at approx 3.15am, but there was no food or drink available. All the restaurants were shut. The first opportunity to drink anything was from the minibar at 4.45am, once I had struggled alone to my room. Still, no food had been provided at all. I was feeling extremely unwell by then & tried to call Reception using the phone in the room, but it was broken. The next thing I remember was waking up at about 12.10pm. I struggled to get up & outside to try to find something to eat. Luckily, I came across a fellow passenger who escorted me to a restaurant for lunch. It was the fellow passenger who told me where the nearest pharmacy was & the rumour she had heard about a bus picking us up at 6pm. Arrived at the airport for our 10pm flight, which was delayed until 11pm. Again, no food on the flight. The excuses for flight delays are usually; pilot stuck on M25, crew sick, plane late in, technical issues, etc.",negative,-0.724085,0,29,8.552367,5.783825

So without checking the bags, she tried to grab ?48 per passenger. I think that easyJet has to look into this. In the end we were not charged as our bags did fit within their strict frame. Apart from their greedy extra charges for hand baggage attempt, I would say that easyJet is very very good.

My son is a full-fare paying passenger (although less than 16 so I am writing this on their behalf). After boarding and takeoff as normal, the seat was momentarily vacated. A passenger in the same row lay down and started to occupy the seat. Neither my son nor I were asked for consent or even informed of this action. All I could tell was a passenger who looked as though they were recovering from a heavy night and wanted a lie down to recover. To enable this, my son had to sacrifice their seat for an indefinite length of time. I raised my issue with the aircrew. My concern was passed between two cabin crew and escalated to their superior. I was told that as I'd momentarily vacated, I had to maintain this status quo and sacrifice my son's seat. No alternative was offered. No timeframe was given. The only option I was presented was for both my son and I to squeeze into the same seat. It transpired the situation lasted for the majority of the flight. The FAA states ""The safest place for your child ... is not in your lap"". Yet this is the situation I found myself in and had to try to explain to my son. When I escalated my concerns, the best the senior cabin crew could offer was advice I should write to customer services and request a refund for my son's seat. I followed this advice.

Bordeaux departure was mess, it says Billi L on the boarding pass, but who would know that that meant a shed at the end of the main terminal that was for low cost airlines - all the Departures signage coming from the hire car drop zone is to the main terminal in the opposite direction. At bag drop there was initially only 1 person sitting at a desk who was more interested in talking to colleagues rather than check in passengers' luggage. Then 2 more arrived and a panic to pull forward passengers travelling to Palma and Marseilles. The last member of our party was charged 45 euros for excess baggage despite having the same baggage as on the outbound flight. The rest of the boarding procedure was an equally overcrowded, hot and unpleasant experience. Why not use the main terminal, especially now it is about empty following France's partial domestic flight ban. Low visibility at Bristol resulted in an aborted landing followed by diversion to Cardiff. The crew were excellent, they kept us informed throughout, the captain stood at the front of the cabin and gave updates directly.

First, I should note that the easyJet terminal at Schipol Airport is separate from all other airlines and has inadequate seating and very limited services. My flight from Amsterdam to Naples was canceled about 30 mins before the departure time, without any prior notice whatsoever that there might be any problems. There were no easyJet staff available to explain what to do. Asking other passengers with previous experience of easyJet cancellations was the only option. I went to the easyJet desk in the baggage claim area but the staff did nothing to help the stranded passengers. Recovering my checked package took 2 hours. After a long delay, the easyJet app offered the option to rebook on another flight, but in fact there were no other flights to Naples, Rome or Milan during the following two days.

Whilst bag-drop was straightforward and easy, getting through passport control was a total nightmare. At least a couple of hundred passengers were trying to reach the immigration booths at the B gates but were prevented by doing so by temporary barriers erected ostensibly to control the crowds but which instead resulted in passengers being kettled and trapped in scary conditions (i.e. risk of being crushed and little to no working air conditioning). One could argue this is the airport¡¯s responsibility rather than the airlines¡¯, but both Ryanair and jet2 sent their staff to the barriers to allow ONLY their passengers past the barriers; easyJet passengers were not allowed through and had to wait for other airline passengers to pass through and then slip through behind them whenever they could. EasyJet did not send down any staff to advocate for their passengers stuck behind the barriers and it was the most chaotic crowd I have ever seen waiting to be stamped out of any country. As a result, our flight was delayed by one hour simply because half of the passengers were still waiting to clear passport control (I overheard one of the ground staff confirm this to the cabin crew after I had been able to finally board). The flight itself was fine, but the experience at Naples airport was harrowing and it was upsetting to see how other low cost airlines bothered to get their passengers passed the barrier whilst easyJet staff were nowhere to be seen.",negative,-0.854276,0,28,8.552367,5.783825

On my last trip there's this staff member in LGW, not very presentable, checking the boarding passes - he asked many travellers to insert their baggage in a tiny space to verify the measurements; if it was half an inch bigger than that, then he tells the travellers that would be ?48 extra charge.

Afterwards I received a confirmation email saying the flight departs in Prague and flies to Milan. After I saw that email I immediately called EasyJet's customer service which was more useless. First he told me that there are no flights from Berlin to Milan at all and that I cannot change my flights at all. When I advised him that the airport is called Milan LIN that EasyJet planes fly to from Berlin, he told me that it would be cheaper for me to just make a new booking as it would be cheaper. However, I would still have to pay for those wrong flights from and to Prague since the booking has been made more than 24 hours ago. I asked him if there are any exceptions because obviously there must be a mistake (and it's possible that this mistake was made by the airline, because why would I book a flight from Prague) but he told me there's nothing that he can do for me. I went online and changed the flights on the website myself. There is no option to change both flights (there and return) at the same time, so I had to pay rebooking fees twice. Moreover there were no suitable return flights available anymore that leave in the evening, so now I had to take one a day later and have to pay for another night at the hotel. All in total I've paid now close to $900 AUD for flights + extra night at the hotel in Milan for one short trip from Berlin to Milan and return, because most likely there is some sort of bug in the system (either skyscanner or easyjet).

Boarding was via stairs and those allocated to board at the rear of the plane boarded as normal whereas those allocated to board via the front stairs were made to queue for around 15 to 20 minutes, standing on the tarmac. Later I discovered by chance that this was to allow a disabled passenger to be loaded first. This is understandable (and I don't mind waiting for that reason) but the failing of easyJet was that they did not communicate this reason to us whilst we were standing in the queue, not knowing what was going on.

At one point it seemed as if we might be 4 hours delayed but in the end we were less than 90 minutes delayed, which was good considering how many other hundreds of flights were cancelled and thousands delayed. We were told to check-in at the usual time; there was no queue at the airport for baggage drop. Staff were friendly, though no explicit mention was made of the likely delays! Boarding was a little chaotic as it required buses to transport everyone from the terminal to the aircraft (so anyone with speedy boarding would have only have had a marginal advantage, if any).

? Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Milan to Gatwick,23-Jul,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," I am writing to express my deep disappointment and sheer frustration with the appalling service I experienced during my recent flight with EasyJet on 20th July 2023. My journey with your airline, on Flight EZY8312 from Milan Malpensa to London Gatwick, was an absolute nightmare from the very outset. To begin with, all the electronic check-in gates at Milan Malpensa Airport were either out of order or deliberately switched off, resulting in an infuriatingly slow and chaotic process. It was quite an ordeal to witness the incompetence of the ground staff, and to add to the misery, there was only one overwhelmed lady dealing with the needs of over three hundred passengers. It is beyond comprehension how an airline of EasyJet's stature could allow such a woefully understaffed situation to occur. Unfortunately, the frustration did not stop there. Upon reaching the departure gate, I was greeted with the distressing sight of an obviously intoxicated and vulgar man causing a commotion at the bar. It was abundantly clear to anyone with basic judgment that this individual was in no condition to fly. He then proceeded to wander around the terminal, rudely interacting with both staff and passengers, while attempting to light a cigarette. The potential safety risk he posed to everyone on the flight was glaringly evident, and I was utterly shocked to witness the inaction of the EasyJet staff in preventing him from boarding the plane. As time passed, the intoxicated passenger's behavior grew increasingly aggressive towards anyone who dared to approach him. Astonishingly, the gate staff checked him in without any regard for the safety of the other passengers, allowing him to board the plane despite the obvious risk he presented. I was among the last passengers to board, and the atmosphere on the plane was one of fear and discomfort as this individual continued to disrupt and behave aggressively throughout the flight. Only after an excruciating two-hour delay and numerous complaints from concerned passengers did the decision to call the police to remove the intoxicated man from the flight finally come about. This delay was further compounded by the lack of clear communication from your staff. Even the pilot expressed disbelief at how this man was allowed to board the plane in his inebriated state. The incident not only caused unnecessary distress to passengers but also created an unprofessional and unsafe environment that is wholly unacceptable. The apparent indifference of your staff towards the welfare of your customers and their failure to act promptly in such a dangerously evident situation is deeply reprehensible.",negative,-0.84771,0,28,8.552367,5.783825

We sat in the plane for another hour then the captain came back with the real reason why we hadn't moved - we are waiting on new cabin crew coming to the plane and we can't find them! They're in the airport somewhere so please bear with us! Really professional.  After 3 hours of sitting on the plane we were then informed that they have found the cabin crew. Cabin crew entered the plane to applause from everyone, however this little bit of joy was not too last. After 5 hours we taxied getting ready for take off then the plane engines stopped and we were informed that our flight was being cancelled! We were then taken from the plane and led through everyone that were awaiting to board other flights like refugees it was embarrassing, when we got to the Swiss port info desk we were then told that easyjet do not have an information desk at the airport anymore, so there was no easyjet rep to explain anything! We were then led to the luggage retrieval belt to wait on our luggage which took a further 2 hours to come out, whilst waiting I noticed young children crying and elderly people so tired and stressed out lying in corners deflated. We were informed by the easyjet app that our whole holiday had been cancelled and we can apply for a full refund (which I'm still awaiting on) and we could claim for compensation. This is were the plot thickens. We got home after 12 hours of stress the next morning I filled in a claim for compensation only to be told a day later that we our not entitled to any because the plane was grounded due to damage on the tyre! Well if that was the case why leave us on damaged plane for 5 hours? This is easyjets legal loophole to get away without paying out compensation claims.

? Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Split to Manchester,23-Jun,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  easyJet left us stranded abroad twice with no money, food, clothing, hotel or way home. They turned off all methods of communication, didn¡¯t answer phone lines and put the phone down on customers. They have no staff in the airports and will tell you to pay for your own expenses and claim back, which they will then deny. They have cost us thousands and haven¡¯t been in touch with us at all. They¡¯ve even blocked our social media comments.  We were supposed to return to the U.K. on the 23rd from Croatia, and so we headed to the airport for our flight from Split to Manchester. We sat for hours in the airport, and noted delay after delay. During the delays, we received no updates from staff, only learning of delays from the easyJet app by checking manually and we were given no food or water. It¡¯s suggested that you should receive vouchers for the delay, but we never did and it would have gotten you a quarter of a bag of the cheapest chocolate from there anyway. Duty free was incredibly expensive and limited, as were the facilities. We sat there for hours and after lots of delays with no communication, easyJet cancelled the flight without notifying us and left everyone stranded in the airport with no help or guidance. The flight appeared as cancelled 40 minutes before the staff decided to make a tannoy announcement. You were left to rebook the flights through the EJ app; there were none for days and they booked up quickly so our group had to split and take whatever was available, paying for the hotel and other costs out of our pocket. The next direct flights weren¡¯t for days, and the other flights were all connecting ones to various places across Europe (Amsterdam, Milan, Rome) etc and not only were they with huge layovers, there were not enough seats on any of them, and also experienced the problem of being during the following days. Our smaller group had taken the Croatia to Milan connecting flight option, as we had group members with limited medication and health issues which we decided were the most important people to get to the U.K. earlier. We were unhappy with all the travelling time but it was the fastest option back into the U.K and we would have been trapped abroad for weeks otherwise, rather than days, so we were left with little choice. As there was no contact from easyJet and the staff were unhelpful, we also had to find a hotel at 11:30pm at night and then also find a way to get to it. Due to the timings, we had no food or water, and no breakfast but due to the dwindling amount of supplies and money we had on us, we had to keep our morning flight to Milan without being able to access any clean clothing or supplies. We did contact our travel insurance but as it was nearly midnight they were closed, and the next day they were completely unhelpful too as they state it is an issue for easyJet to resolve first, so they cannot and would not help. We went through the airport as normal the next day, and boarded our flight.

? Trip Verified ,A321N,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Funchal to Lisbon,23-Jun,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Flight EJU7628 FNC-LIS was originally scheduled to leave at 22:00 on 02.06.2023 but was considerably delayed until 00:00 on 03.06.2023. The boarding staff at Funchal then informed that the flight had been cancelled. All passengers had already shown their boarding card and identification document. The boarding staff did not give any reason for the cancellation, only that they had just been informed. easyJet did not volunteer to send any messages during this hiatus. Legitimately outraged passengers shouted insults and kicked the easyJet queue separators. easyJet had a crew strike scheduled for 03.06.2023 from 00:00 but claims the ""delay"" [cancellation], was due to problems with the control tower, which is highly dubious because the TAP, Ryanair and SATA flights landed after the easyJet plane from Lisbon at 23:10 on 02.06.2023, without any disruptions. It was reported that easyJet had been transferring planes from European bases to Portugal with non-Portuguese crew, this combined with the strike in Portugal I believe was the real reason for the cancelation or delay, so the crew exceeded flight times. Despite appearing on the movement panel of Funchal airport as a cancelled flight, having in my possession and that I attach, photo with date and time watermark, besides the visible time on the panel itself, that the flight was cancelled. At this moment, abandoned at Funchal airport, I am forced to rebook a flight to Lisbon as soon as possible, which cost me an extra expense, inherent to easyJet's lack of professionalism, of 312.99 euros. Everything lead me to believe, with no room for doubt, that the flight was cancelled. Only at 01:30 of 03.06.2023, when I had already been forced to reschedule my trip due to easyJet's total lack of diligence, does easyJet send an SMS that the flight was rescheduled for 12:00 of 03.06.2023, 14 hours after the scheduled and original departure of the flight. easyJet did not provide the possibility to accept or refuse the rerouting, they only changed the booking and checked in by myself, without any consent, whether I accepted the new flight, wanted a cash or voucher refund. Under the terms of Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, of 11 February 2004, I am entitled to compensation for the 14-hour delay I suffered - if it is not correctly considered that this was an effective cancellation - to the value of at least 250.00 euros plus the expenses incurred with the need to rebook on the nearest flight (312.99 euros), since easyJet had not informed passengers until 1.30 am on 3 June 2023.

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Gatwick to Naples,23-Jun,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  If you want to travel to EU from London, I'd suggest you use any other company. I flew to Naples on the 3/06/23. The flight landed in a different airport from what it should have been - we were informed halfway through the flight that we had missed NAP closing time by 6 minutes, and had to land in Milan (800km away) instead. Surely, EasyJet would have checked with Naples airport that we were ok to land at the ETA to authorise departure. I'm sure that, where there's a risk of missing closing time by 6 mins as we were told, the considerate & reasonable thing to do would be to cancel the flight. I have reasons to believe that this was not done so that the incident could be marked as ""exceptional circumstances"", so that EasyJet could get away with not refunding passengers as per its refund policy. So either the staff was so na?ve as to not consider that flights can miss closing time by 6 mins, or this was deliberate fraudulent behaviour. Either way, it was unacceptable. EasyJet kept us waiting 5 hours at the airport, before boarding us and only then diverting our plane. We were also promised that EasyJet would provide accommodation and alternative transport, only to find out after 2 hours' wait that no, this would not be provided and we would have to think for ourselves. I was going to Naples to attend a wedding, which I missed. I cannot think of anything that would repay me not only of the financial cost, but also the time waste (the whole trip took me 21 h), and the psychological stress the company has deliberately inflicted on me.

? Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Luton to Edinburgh,23-Apr,3,3,,,,1,1,no,1," I am writing to denounce my profound regret regarding my flights with easyJet. Customers try to choose EasyJet because they are low costs but the hidden fees and the staff behaviour made me spend with easyJet really more than other airlines such as Air France or Lufthansa. I think that easyJet has many problems including the fact that a flight can only be changed for an important cost (?49) when it is within two months (who will book and change a flight before two months?). Hence the change would represent twice the price of the flight price. However, I am writing regarding a specific issue. Yesterday, I had two flights with easyJet, the first from Lyon to London Luton and the second from London Luton to Edinburgh. Three days before my flight I bought the right to have a large cabin bag (that cost me ?47 for the first flight and ?15 for the second one). Everything was OK with the first flight where I had my cabin bag with me in the cabin (where its place should be). However, in London Luton, the staff member at the check-in desk forced me to pay 48 additional pounds for the same cabin bag with a 10.9kg weight (in order to check it in as hold luggage). Please note that the same bag fitted really well on the plane for the first flight (from Lyon to London Luton). Moreover, I observed that other passengers had cabin bags larger than mine. Hence, today I observed that easyJet staff are not coherent in imposing additional fees to customers from one country to another. Also, they are not treating their customers in the same manner. I initially paid around ?22 for this flight. In the end, it cost me ?85: ?22 (initial payment) + ?15 (Large cabin bag ) + ?48 (when they forced me to check in the large cabin bag that was supposed to come with me in the cabin) In addition to this, you can read on the news every day about the high rate of delays and cancellations of this airline. Don't underestimate the stress that can be caused by this airline. Also, it has plenty of other low costs around that do not have such bad reviews from customers.

We have in the past used Ryanair occasionally but once they started seating couples separately if they did not pay for seats we ceased to do so. EasyJet suits us perfectly and flies to the places we want to visit. We were apprehensive when the rules / charges relating to baggage taken on board were changed, but we experimented flying with backpacks only which will fit under the seats in front and found that we could easily manage with those for a week's holiday. Since then we have happily travelled lightly and found it very easy indeed. We actually registered the fact on our most recent trip that is the ""Speedy Boarding"" passengers who now rush to queue when the boarding staff appear because they want to make sure of finding locker space as close to their seats as possible. The rest of us who have not paid extra for anything can just wait and board at our leisure. I can't recall more than one major delay in all the years we have used easyJet and just a few minor ones. On our last trip earlier this month both the outward and inward flights left and arrived slightly early. Flying out from Liverpool as we invariably do, we find it very rare that there is any nitpicking about bag sizes (despite some of the bags that we sometimes see!) and the whole process of flying with easyJet for us is relatively relaxed. It obviously helps that we know the ropes and that we keep abreast of any rule changes e.g. regarding baggage. It does seem to me that some of the critics fail to check on things like this and therefore are at least partly to blame when faced with charges they did not expect.",positive,0.375859,0,28,8.552367,5.783825

I asked him, why, and he mentioned that doing it through the website is cheaper. The situation was ridiculous, even though I spent precious time chatting with him, EasyJet wants to charge me more because of their badly designed system. I wished I could do it by the website without expending more time. So I recommend to people to even booked passenger tickets separately and you can manage the options individually or book flight tickets with another company which has a better system, EasyJet tries to get as much money as they can from their loyal customers.

I explained to him how frustrated this was for me as a customer, and at the end of the call he asked me to hang up on me before he hung up on me himself.

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Porto,22-Sep,2,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  At first, the ground crew manager came up to the passengers asking for volunteers to change to another flight (they would fly to Santiago de Compostela instead, and have a bus waiting for them to take them to Porto, and all they offered was a 500€ compensation, which is much less than what they should actually have to pay every passenger if no one took the offer and they had to refuse entry to passengers) as they mismanaged and overbooked this flight (even though they kept insisting on that it was an aircraft issue and they had to use a smaller one, while the people at the check in desks said clearly that it was overbooked). After that, the boarding process took ages, as some people had their passes invalidated due to the mentioned overbooking issue, meaning their seats (mine included) were unavailable. What's funny about this is that even people in rows as low as 10-15 or so had their seats invalidated. Anyway the boarding process took well over an hour for the lucky ones, all the while the ground crew was being extremely rude to people that didn't yet fully understand the issue, instead of explaining what they were trying to do to solve the issue (we passengers do not care how your worthless service screwed up the bookings, do not belittle us for not understanding what stupid excuses you make). Now for the unlucky ones that had their seats invalidated, we were put to the side while they tried to figure out what to do, all the while the ground crew kept insisting for us to take the 500€ and go on another flight or whatever, which I find extremely distasteful, knowing that all of us should be compensated much better had we been refused entry. Some people that were put to the side still accepted the offer, which in the end did make room for everyone else on the flight, after of course another hour or so of waiting. Now with all that said, I wouldn't have minded the issue as much if it weren't for the rudeness of the ground crew, the almost 2 hours of keeping us in the dark about what was going to happen to us, and the persistence of the ground crew manager to have us go to another flight, if you really wanted that to happen offer something better than just 500€, you know very well the compensation the airline would have to give us had we been refused entry. To add insult to injury, when at last the flight took off, we weren't offered anything at all in flight, not one measly bottle of water or a bag of chips or a small cup of coffee, nothing, absolutely worst customer service ever. As a bonus, the cabin crew hit my leg with the food/beverage cart while I was sleeping, admittedly I had my leg on the corridor, which I hadn't done on purpose or willingly, but instead of waking me up to move my leg, they just hit it and all I got was a ""Oh sorry sir"", then the attendant moved on like nothing happened. It only hurt for a bit, it's not like I want monetary compensation or anything for that, but yeah a cup of coffee could have made it up for almost everything.

Contacting easyJet to get some sort of reimbursement is a nightmare, apparently getting reimbursement for a delayed flight isn't possible, the reason given, because it was delayed. The delay according to EasyJet was extraordinary circumstances, according to our pilot these circumstances were EasyJet running an overfull schedule that Gatwick could not service, and EasyJet not having staff to service these flights. The impression I'm given by easyJet's communication then is that it's my own fault for having incurred additional costs on arrival because I choose to fly with EasyJet.

? Trip Verified ,A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Paris,22-Aug,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  I would like to report on a very unpleasant experience with a baggage inspector and in this context I would like to claim back the illegally collected fine of 29€. The whole thing happened on August 17th, 2022 at around 6:20 p.m. at Gate A38 of BER Airport, where I and my travel companion should have boarded flight EJU5539 to Paris Orly at 5:35 p.m. So the flight was already delayed. Shortly before passing the counter, a very unfriendly baggage inspector waved me out. He said my hand luggage was too big. It was a business case (see picture attached), which I have been using for years with EasyJet. On the baggage measurement system, it also fitted perfectly in terms of height and width. It only exceeded the thickness by a minimum of approx. 0.5 cm (which the baggage inspector had to indicate with a pen).  When I then took the suitcase to repack something for my travel companion, the employee yelled at me where I wanted to go. He threatened me it's too late, I have to pay or the luggage will stay here. After I still managed to take out a few things and the case continued to protrude slightly over the limit, I tried to explain to the employee that this is just air in the case and that the exact dimensions can be maintained by pressing lightly. The employee then slapped my hands and yelled ""hands off"" and threatened again that the suitcase had to stay here. Under this pressure, I paid in order not to miss the flight. I suspect that the employee deliberately wanted to play off his position of power. Unfortunately there is no way to counteract this. The customer service in particular treats the customers here like dirt. Either you get an email with an answer with copy & paste FAQ's or on Instagram it is claimed that unfortunately nothing can be done. (Where there is a will, there is a way? ) Hiermit m?chte ich von einer sehr unangenehmen Erfahrung mit einem Gep?ckkontrolleur berichten und in diesem Zusammenhang die widerrechtlich eingezogene Strafgeb¨¹hr von 29€ (siehe Kontoauszug) zur¨¹ckfordern. Das ganze spielte sich den 17.08.22 um ca. 18:20 am Gate A38 des Flughafen BER ab, an welchem ich mit meiner Reisebegleitung bereits um 17:35 auf den Flug EJU5539 nach Paris Orly h?tte boarden sollen. Der Flug war also schon versp?tet. Kurz vor passieren des Schalters winkte mich dann ein sehr unfreundlicher Gep?ckkontrolleur heraus. Er meinte mein Handgep?ckst¨¹ck sei zu gro?. Dabei handelte es sich um einen Business Koffer (siehe Bild im Anhang), mit dem ich schon seit Jahren problemlos mit EasyJet reiste. Auf der Gep?ckmessanlage passte er von H?he und Breite dementsprechend auch perfekt rein. Lediglich die Dicke ¨¹berschritt er minimal um ca. 0,5 cm (was der Gep?ckkontrolleur mit einem Kugelschreiber andeuten musste). Als ich dann den Koffer nahm, um etwas zu meiner Reisebegleitung umzupacken schrie mich der Mitarbeiter an wo ich hinwollte. Er drohte mir es ist zu sp?t, ich muss zahlen oder das Gep?ck bliebe hier. Nachdem ich es dennoch schaffte ein paar Sachen herauszunehmen und der Koffer weiterhin minimal ¨¹ber die Begrenzung ragte, versuchte ich dem Mitarbeiter zu verdeutlichen, dass dies nur Luft im Koffer ist und durch leichtes andr¨¹cken exakt die Ma?e eingehalten werden. Daraufhin schlug der Mitarbeiter auf meine H?nde und schrie ,,H?nde weg"" und drohte erneut, dass der Koffer hierbleiben m¨¹sse. Unter diesem Druck zahlte ich, um den Flug nicht zu verpassen. Ich vermute, dass der Mitarbeiter bewusst seine Machtposition ausspielen wollte. Leider gibt es keine M?glichkeit dagegen vorzugehen.

Filled out the claim form and the person had the nerve to say they wouldn't give us a refund because the flight was only 4 minutes late!

We had extra-legroom seats in one of the over wing emergency exit rows but the standard seats looked fine for someone my height (1.74 m). Space is helped by the thin seats, I was concerned on first sitting down that these seemed rather firm but they must be well shaped because I stayed comfortable for the 3hr50 flight.

We were advised that our original flight was cancelled due to crew sickness. Apparently easyJet had no standby crew available in order to allow our flight to Bodrum depart. No empathy was shown by any easyJet ground staff at Bristol.

Aweek before departure, we observed changes overnight in the restrictions introduced in Germany due to the prevailing pandemic. We have completed all the documents required by the German side so that our trip could take place. In addition, we checked the EasyJet app and EasyJet Hub every day to be sure that any additional changes would not affect our flight. The last change made to the Easyjet Hub took place on December 20. On the day of departure, the Easy jet staff responsible for boarding informed us that we would not be admitted to the flight to Berlin because we have Polish passports and we do not have a transit ticket (from Berlin Brandenburg airport to another airport). The situation was extremely stressful for us, because despite having all the necessary documents, we were refused a flight. We asked to contact the shift manager to confirm this decision, informing in advance that we had spent too much time trying to resolve the situation, which could result in the inability to change the flight (we could have changed the flight up to 2 hours before departure) we informed the staff that I am pregnant and this situation stressed me as well as my five-year-old son, yet we were told to wait for the manager's decision. After two hours, we have been informed that we would not be allowed to fly despite the documents we presented due to the fact that the staff interpreted the restrictions in their own way.

Not only did I pay 80€ for an extra cabin bag that I didn't even get to use and had to get rid of all my cosmetic belongings because they exceeded the ml limit, I had to pay an extra 58€ to get my luggage checked in. The hostess in an arrogant tone told me my baggage was too big. I had already changed my luggage for a smaller one, got rid of half my clothes and it was too big ! Only a small wheel got past the metal box, as deserted as the plane was and given the situation they could have clearly arranged a place for my baggage. And when I suggested to refund the cabin bag or at least reduce it from the price of the cabin bag that I couldn't use the condescending woman said and I quote ""You knew what you were doing by bringing this bag, it is your fault not mine"". I am filled with so much rage ,anger and even sadness. The way she spoke like I was some insignificant number, just another dumb client enraged me to the depths of my soul. I can't deny I mistakenly thought the baggage would fit in the cabin but there is no excuse for the treatment I was given.

Thankfully though, their onboard sales are temporarily suspended and the aircraft looked neat and well cleaned. They definitely need more flights on this route, I paid 307 euros for both ways for flights that are domestic and no longer than one hour and a half.

In January we booked our flights to the UK with British Airways and we booked a flight from Glasgow to Belfast with easyJet. In June our British Airways flights got cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Covid-19 numbers in South Africa have steadily been rising and experts estimate, that the peak will only be reached in September. Since the cancellation of our British Airways flights, I have trying to get in contact with easyJet, to let them know, that there is no conceivable way we can get to Glasgow by the 21st August. All attempts to contact easyJet have been unsuccessful. After two hours of being on line with their customer care line listening to the stupid ring tone, I realised no one was on the other line. I tried their facebook, twitter and email accounts, but could get no response at all. Earlier this year, the easyJet website clearly stated that change fees will be waived due to the pandemic, as long as the changes occur 14 days prior to the scheduled flight.

Thought that the airport might have allocated staff to run things more smoothly and in a more reassuring way. Wrong!

In the new dates we closed the COVID-19 problem arose again, we tried again to contact the call center, but in vain no one ever answered us. The only information we have is that they will inform us one day before our flight, if it will happen, which makes it impossible to fully manage the rest of our travel bookings because the company does not know until the last minute whether it will take us to the destination us, without of course giving us the option of a refund or a coupon.",negative,-0.865966,1,25,8.03722,-6.984716

Our flight was over 5 hours delayed due to an air traffic control strike which we were informed about whilst on the plane already 2 hours delayed. We were originally booked on British Airways and they cancelled the night before, which means EasyJet would have known about the strike at the same time and failed to act accordingly (notify us or tell us there would be a delay). We were kept outside in the cold waiting to board for 30 minutes before the plane was ready, then we were kept on the plane for 4 hours without any refreshments and not letting us disembark to stretch our legs. Then we were let off the plane into the gate to buy some food, which we had to pay for ourselves and not given any vouchers. Finally, we were let back onto the plane and took off almost 6 hours after the originally scheduled take-off time. They then provided us each with a soft drink and bag of crisps - hardly something sustainable for a delay of over 6 hours. The pilot told us that they should not have treated us like this and urged us all to file a complaint and ask for compensation due to the fact that the airline failed to inform us of the strike prior to boarding/delays. The crew told us that we could not get off and refuse to take the flight if we wanted to receive compensation so we felt stuck in this regard.

The lounge and service is good as there are sufficient selection of food, snacks and drinks available. They also call when boarding is starting and the lounge is located very close to the Amsterdam boarding gate. The boarding process on easyJet is by priority (speedy boarding), but you need to make sure that you are ready as it is difficult to get overhead space to put your hand baggage if you are not ahead of the queue.

A lot of trouble with Eurowings when it comes to being on time and canceled flights. Totally the opposite with easyJet - I had more than 20 flights with them in the last 6 months. No delays, no canceled flights, professional and friendly crew - quite often with a good sense of humor. The prices are super competitive and they also part of an exchange now to make flying more friendly for the environment - already included in the ticket price. With Lufthansa, you have to go to an own platform and it¡¯s complicated, takes extra time plus you pay on top without a tax benefit. easyJet is probably not the best place to work for the employees but it seems they have a good culture and the service is great.",positive,0.526984,1,25,8.03722,-6.984716

They have known well in advance, that the flight would be delayed but did not dare to inform passengers. They could not care less. We were also not provided any updates on the additional delay in the plane. We were just told they switched the planes. Such a behavior displayed is simply unacceptable and unprofessional.

On arrival at the gate I found there was a long queue into the ¡®room¡¯ where final boarding card and passport checks are carried out. Passengers were queueing out of the room and up two flight of stairs. There were signs for ¡®speedy boarding¡¯ but these were utterly pointless due to the overcrowding in the stairwell - the only staff on hand (who should have been marshalling this situation) were staff telling people that their hand luggage would have to go in the hold as the overhead lockers would be too full - fortunately this didn¡¯t affect me as the staff started this process well behind me at the back of the queue, which then started moving. On arrival into the room and managed to fight my way through to the speedy boarding lane - I was naturally the last person in this queue. When we boarded the aircraft I then found that there was no space in the overhead lockers anywhere near my seat (1B), mostly because they were full of hats, coats, handbags, scarves and other items which, if the cabin staff had any sense and were in any way proactive about the situation, could have been put under the seat in front. At the insistence of the particularly unhelpful male cabin crew member, I had to place my hand luggage, for which I had paid extra, in the overhead lockers about 10 rows back on one side and the other item about 13 rows back on the other. I asked him if he would be retrieving them for me on departure to which he replied ¡®no, I won¡¯t be getting them¡¯ - I already knew the answer and I knew equally well that this would mean that I would either have to fight my way upstream to retrieve them on landing, or wait for the entire aircraft to empty before going back to get them, which is the option I took which meant that I was the last passenger to leave the aircraft...from seat 1B - absolutely ridiculous.

I have also flown a few times with a small backpack (to put under my feet) and a carry on luggage no problem with other airlines. The counter staff seemed unsympathetic at all and was pressuring me to just pay the CHF 76 and move along, standing in front of me just saying that it was impossible that all the stuff would fit (when I was trying to put the stuff from the small bag to the larger one.) She even went as far as to suggest to me and another family that we won't be allowed to test the luggage dimensions again and just to pay the 76 francs. (That's nearly as much as the ticket itself!) Even, when I did manage to fit the small suitcase into the slot, she said that it had to be smooth fit and that it couldn't be squeezed in. I have never expected such strictness and unreasonable behaviour from airport staff before and I can only believe it was out of spite that she said this as she realised that I had actually been able to fit the backpack into the carry on suitcase. I even saw her pressure the other family to pay just because they had an iPad that was not in the carry-on. When I got on, there was more than enough space in the overhead lockers and I had intended to put my backpack under my feet in any case to save space. In the end, I was forced by the same staff member to throw out my slippers as again she claimed they were an additional item of luggage. Seriously? All it did for easyJet, in the end, was that there was no way I would pay such a money-grabbing 76 francs and it didn't solve their issue of overcrowded luggage as the now larger suitcase was taking up more space in the overhead compartment than if I had 2 separate ones, 1 above and the small backpack underneath my feet. All in all, I believe this to be an extremely frustrating experience for both myself and easyJet as a company which could have been much better handled with more reasonable and less spiteful staff members who could have been more professional with the way they handled customers. Would not recommend this airline if you are looking for a decent customer experience.",negative,-0.69875,1,25,8.03722,-6.984716

We followed the website protocol and booked 3 bags into the hold. We were well below the (combined) baggage allowance but preferred to play it safe rather than have hassle at the airport. Equally, none of us had wheelie suitcases but the kids and my husband had little rucksacks while I took a bag that fitted into the under-seat dimensions. As a result, we had no issues at the gate. On the return flight, they were asking everyone at the back of line, where we were, with wheeled luggage to check it into the hold but they looked at our bags and said 'that's fine'. I think that you just need to follow the rules with easyJet if you want a pleasant experience. Other than that, the flights themselves were great. Friendly pilots, very friendly cabin crew and an efficient service. We had onboard snacks and drinks and they were all very good. I don't think they were overly expensive but another time, we might take our own snacks to save a bit.

When all passengers was seated and ready to go,  the captain announced a delay of 1 hour and 30 minutes and we had to wait inside the plane.

Until 8pm I was not even sure if my luggage was located. Finally they¡¯ve found it at Luton airport. No info by email/sms. Someone at the call center told me that the bag is scheduled for a flight on Day 3 and should be in Seville at 11am. Day 3: I¡¯ve called easyjet early morning to figure out if the bag will be delivered today. Throughout the day, three people at easyjet provided me with certainty that the bag will be delivered today to my hotel in the afternoon, ¡°certainly today¡±. I was a fool to trust them again one can judge. If they could only inform me that they cant guarantee a certain day of delivery - I would have come to the airport myself and collected my stuff, without which I was stuck in a Spanish village with almost nothing to do as all my holidays were dependent on my sports equipment. Easyjet turned out to be  liars as the luggage has not arrived that day. Also, only after my complaint about no communication - they did send another update, after more than 48 hours. Day 4 At 8am I reached the call renter again and a person there told me completely different info, that they have handed my bag over to the delivery center and can¡¯t guarantee time of delivery. Why on Earth have not his colleagues told me the same info the day before?! All of them were assuring me to expect the bag in the hotel on Day 3. I was redirected to the local airport for more information. I¡¯ve been trying to call them for 3 hours (was even wondering if this was a holiday in Spain?). Only at 11am someone picked up and told me that I should not call every day to them, and they already handed over my bag to the delivery company and no longer have info on that. I asked them to provide me with the phone number of the delivery company so I can track my bag and they were not able to provide it. I felt completely lost, miserable and helpless to be honest. At 2pm I received email which stated that the bag was delivered - it was NOT. I felt they were kidding me. Called them again - they have informed that the bag should be with me at 5pm.

The outcome was a short stop at Cardiff to refuel during which the weather improved at Bristol and we eventually landed at our destination about 3 hours late. All through, the flight and cabin crew (Antonio was cabin manager) kept us informed and were calm and encouraging - dealing with a poorly passenger and someone who was stressed, 22 passengers who chose to get off at Cardiff and a subsequent security check of the plane.

After letting other women with totes and carry ons walk by she picked me out and asked me to open my carry on, put my tote in it, close it and fit it into the carry on size check boxes. My carry on is sold under description it  says allowed on EasyJet flights. When i did what she asked me to do my suitcase fit but i couldnt bend and lift the carry on again. When I asked for help she said she would come but made me wait until almost everyone had boarded. I asked her why she was being so mean to me while letting everyone else walk by with same or more luggage. No response. Instead of helping me she walked back to the line and boarded more passengers. At the end it was a kind young female passenger that helped me lift the carry on out of the size checking bars. She also commented on the employee's rudeness.  Because I was late in boarding despite having paid extra for a front row seat, my carry on ended up being stored 20 rows behind me. It will be fun finding it after landing. It is not that she asked me to check what is a standard rule at EasyJet but that she did not ask other with same or more weight to do the same so I was arbitrarily picked by her. I wish I had other choices when flying out of Bristol but Easyjet is my only option. I would really appreciate the company providing some common sense and empathy training to their customer-facing employees and ensuring that their rules are standard for all passengers, not just those an employee arbitrarily selects.

She then supplied us with two tickets from Manchester to Palma the next day for two of us to continue our holiday. When I asked how much I would have to pay she said that Easyjet would foot the bill.

So I don¡¯t understand the fact that was no space left. I found this very upsetting and disrespectful. This shows a completely poor attitude and a huge lack of moral and lack of professionality and lack of passion from the crew member. She might have had a tough day, maybe she was already on her second/third flight on her shift, but still: you get paid for it. It¡¯s your job, not mine.

My flight was delayed for 3 hours and 30 minutes. The explanation of the delay was due to weather conditions in the city of departure (Barcelona). In fact, it was raining in the morning by afternoon it was slightly cloudy and other planes were departing on time from Barcelona. I was trying to contact the airlines by phone but it was not helpful at all. No response. Online chat button did not work and moreover, it is only available till 8 pm. During the waiting time, a representative of the air company offered the passengers a voucher for only 4 euros (a meal is much more expensive in the airport). Furthermore, the information about the vouchers was on their website an hour before they really started distributing them. The most important that I was not able to be on time at a railway station in Paris because I needed to go by train to another city in France. Being a student and having a limited budget I lost the money spent on my train ticket.

Instead she rather just ran off a standard speech that the flight is not delayed and that I needed to go and find my wife. Once we had checked into the boarding area there were all sorts of pa announcements calling for late passengers. After this a PA announcement came stating the pilot was delayed in arriving so the flight was indeed delayed. I would like to give Easyjet a big fat zero for this customer service.

We felt our only realistic option was to book another flight for my husband and I as the likely hood of people not turning up for a flight in the school holidays was unlikely and likewise with easy jet putting on another plane. We spoke to easy jet about this and had to pay again! So we paid ?275 each return originally and then the new flight out because they over booked and wouldn¡¯t guarantee anything cost ?150 each. To say I am disgusted with the airline is an understatement. To not exchange our outbound flight for free as they over booked our seats that we paid for months before is beyond as is leaving clients with very little alternatives than to either cancel the holiday or re book flights.

We looked for someone from easyJet to ask for help but at that time the airport was deserted.

I sent the request for reimbursement of at least the taxi since no one will repay us for all the inconveniences attached to this delay ... but at least the out-of-pocket expenses.

This Friday I faced yet another 3 hour delay, I hear all those saying claim, but this doesn't return the time lost and away from my family. What it does do though is add an expensive ?50 taxi fare with other transport options closed at 2am. So, the moral of my story is, with a very delayed Friday the night prior I contacted easyJets plus and flight club that I have membership of hoping that I might be permitted to move my 9pm Sunday flight to an earlier option. I advised of the issues, very politely I add, the day before asking simply to take the plane 50mins earlier. Sure ?100 plus was the reply, so this is from an airline that has over ?5k of my money in flights booked through to march 2020, zero empathy, zero flexibility advising turn up early and take your chances like everyone else. So flight club and plus membership, let alone loyalty stands for absolutely nothing. Never once have I submitted an eu261 claim for the countless late arrivals and multiple taxi fares.

The speedy boarding option offered by easyJet is worth the price as it avoids long queues. It is also possible to book seats with extra legroom, providing all passengers are over 16. Of course, the price adds up and if you pay for hold baggage as well it can cost as much as a regular (not cut-price) airline. For us, the convenience of flying from Luton makes this worthwhile.

We went to the information desk and asked what to do next and we¡¯re pointed out of the waiting lounge to the EasyJet desk.

The next day we arrived for our flight, again 4/5 hours to spare. We got through security checks etc, and as soon as we got through to the waiting area our flight was delayed by an hour. It was then delayed further, and then delayed again and again. We waited for an extra couple hours and to our surprise we were given a gate to go to! We rushed to the gate, waited there for about 20 minutes, we were then told we had to wait for our flight to land and passengers to get off. We proceeded to wait. We watched the plane land, the passengers get off, bags being unloaded. Flights were taking off all around us. After watching all of this, everyone was getting agitated. Many people were surrounding the gate desk, asking what was happening. No one was getting a straight answer. Later we were told our flight was yet again cancelled for the second time. We then had to wait again for buses back to the baggage area. We made it back to the EasyJet desk with a queue of about 100+ people, all angry and upset. We waited for an additional 20 minutes before someone come out to speak to the passengers. One man at the front of the queue was very angry and started to raise his voice so the manager and employees walked away, back to the staff room I presume, and refused to speak to anyone because of one angry passenger raising his voice.

I was left stranded in Zurich near midnight (not familiar at all with Zurich) and told to figure out how I would get to my destination on my own. Here is the text from them: We're sorry that your flight has diverted to Zurich airport. This is due to the closure of Basel airport. The disruption is beyond our control and is considered an extraordinary circumstance. We're very sorry but due to high demand in Zurich we are unable to arrange onward transport for you. If you¡¯re able to make your own arrangements, we will refund the cost. Please retain all your receipts in order to make your claim. If you need any further assistance please speak to one of our ground crew in the airport who will be happy to help you. Note ""if you are able to make your own arrangements"" and ""one of our ground crew in the airport... will be happy to help you"" I found one of the ground crew and kindly asked them for help. They told me ""go catch a train"" (I remained very polite since I know it isn't their fault). I asked them where the train station was and if they could help me figure out which train .. they stated just walk straight and turn left you will see a train station (that is all they would say or do, I was left in shock) They offered no other assistance. I found the airport train station and because it was late at night no one was working there. I had to go to the automatic ticket machines. After struggling for 15 minutes I found out that to get to Basel I would have to take two trains and one bus, all of this in the middle of the night in a place I am unfamiliar with. Why couldn't they have at least given us a map and a guide to which trains we would need to take? This could have been very easy for them to print out and offer. When I arrived at Basel (after 2:00 am) I was informed that a KLM flight who was in the same predicament as my easyJet flight - diverted to Zurich., told their passengers to wait and when the storm moved past... flew them on to Basel. I would avoid this airline at all costs, they don't really care if you make it to your destination nor do they care about your  safety. I am still struggling to understand how they can drop you off in a different place and do nothing to help you get to your intended destination.

A lot of passengers made comments to each other, including the two passengers sat next to me, at how we had been spoken to. Now I fully understand that the safety briefing is extremely important and from time to time the cabin crew have to be firm with passengers to get their attention, but there is a difference between being firm with customers and being angry/aggressive.

Aircraft was spotless inside and Edinburgh based crew were friendly and welcoming to everyone. Comfortable window seat, decent leg room as I¡¯m 6¡±1, didn¡¯t feel claustrophobic on this full A320. Much better than the A319 on the Glasgow-Sch?nefeld outbound on the Thursday where I felt squashed in the window seat. Even though the boarding looked slow at the terminal side, this was completed quickly and soon we were on our way. Service was quick to commence and a reasonable selection of products available onboard. I had prepaid for a bistro voucher so took advantage of the hot meal deal which todays hot selection was the Ham and Cheese Croissant. Hot all the way through, and sufficient for an early evening snack along with a chocolate bar and Earl Grey Tea. Also had a few G&T¡¯s which was perfectly reasonable in terms of price, €14 Remember, these are served as double measures. About 3/4 of the way through the flight I went to pour my last gin when realised that during the trash run, I gave them the full bottle of gin rather than the empty one! So while heading to the back to the toilet, I had a laugh with the crew mentioning what I had done. To my surprise, one of the crew opened the recycling bag and had a quick check to see if the full bottle was amongst the trash. I did not expect that, and we had a laugh about it. No luck, which I assumed. During decent, the cabin manager was making her was from the back, stopped at my row and handed me over a g&t, they had found the full bottle, yet it was too dirty to hand back, so gave me a fresh one. That was well above what I expected! Landed 20mins ahead of schedule, as always lovely views coming into Edinburgh, but the time saved was ruined due to airport ground traffic and being bussed to immigration. Not easyJet¡¯s fault.

Personally, I find the free carry-on bag allowance pretty generous). The flight was delayed 30 minutes due to late arrival of the aircraft, which is still reasonable for any airline these days.

Tried to put all of the items in carry on bag for all 4 passengers. In order to avoid paying ?50 for each person, threw away two personal bags and stuffed all in checked in bags. Laptop, iPad, money bag and jacket was left in one personal bag. Representative insisted to stuff  all in 1 carry on because no personal items allowed. I showed her the board outside the boarding area, which says allowed personal items, she said, ""the board is not applicable to my ticket"". EasyJet was my connecting flight. We started with the same carryon on WestJet Airlines from Los Angeles to Calgary to Gatwick. Same carry-on with personal items was okay with WestJet but wasn¡¯t okay with EasyJet. Representative said each airline has their policy. I charged ?50 to my credit card and told her that easyjet will get 4 bad reviews today, she said, ""nothing she could do"". Now I¡¯ll have to go to baggage claim for the one of the carry-on's that were checked in, which will delay my plans in Paris.

Baggage took 30 minutes to arrive at baggage area. Uber ride started at 6.10, overall 1.5 hours lost.

Is there any governing body that could punish bad and intentionally fraudulent practices by airlines like EasyJet?

If yes, why did they announce at 1.35 that the gate is closing and made us run?

I assumed that this was an attempt to compete with other discount airlines like Ryanair, etc. We checked in on line, and while waiting at the gate to board, there was an EasyJet employee going through the line and picking people out of the line and charging them a 50 pound fine for having an extra bag. She got a number of people as she did this and had a machine at the ready to charge our credit cards. When I protested, she said that our personal items were too big, and that I should have read the terms and conditions more carefully. How many people do that? Without being a member of their ""Easy travellers"" group, it was the same as always, and we were ""fined"" 100 pounds because our personal items were too large. Had we known, we would have factored that additional charge into the cost of our flight, and would have likely flown with someone else as the EasyJet flight was much more than other airlines with the additional baggage cost, and they flew at inconvenient times, and into the nasty, old disused terminal at Sofia Airport. If someone makes you pay an additional 100 pounds to board a flight you have already paid for, there is no name for it other than theft, fraud or extortion.

There was one guy in an EasyJet uniform who was a passenger but was sitting in the best seats in the house given lots of free food by his over attentive friend (before anyone else was served). Subsided again by paying passengers? Regular passengers such as we were overlooked (the guy at the end of our row was asked if he wanted anything but we weren¡¯t).

Well these guys didn¡¯t like that and began denying everything. We held our ground and the off-duty guy became quite aggressive, almost shouting.

I told him I wasn¡¯t some weakling he could push around and at that point the pilot came out, ignored me and went to speak to my daughter- who was by now near the plane door and quite upset as she¡¯s a nervous flyer and these lunatics weren¡¯t helping.

We booked our flight two and a half months ahead of time, and when I went to check-in for my flight, the website had said I had to visit the desk when I arrived at the airport. Thinking there was no issue, I arrived at the airport for EasyJet to tell me that I did not have a seat on the plane. Her exact words were, ""You paid for the flight, not for a seat."" Apparently, people who pay 24 euros extra to choose their seat have priority in getting a seat on the plane over those who do not. So, since they overbooked the flight, I did not have a seat on the plane I paid for (and neither did my friend), but our other friend did and had to travel to Paris alone. A worker escorted my friend and I to a counter where we got a new reservation for a flight that was 5 hours later than our original flight. We did get a 9 euro voucher and ""speedy boarding,"" but overall a flawed system and do not recommend booking with EasyJet unless you want to pay 24 euros extra to choose a seat or want to run the risk of spending 10 hours (total) in the airport. We also had to go through security again after visiting the counter where they rescheduled our flight. That was fun.",negative,-0.649465,0,24,8.761707,5.857933

They wanted to charge us €60 per case to go in the hold. I felt humiliated and embarrassed, having to pull out personal items such as underwear etc in front of over 100 individuals who were getting on to the flight. There was no privacy provided to try and rearrange the bags. After re-arranging the bags, and managing to get everything in to the one bag, the crew in the airport then called to say that cabin bags could be put in the hold for free  as the flight was busy and they would need any space possible. They do this after watching us struggle to put our items all in to one small cabin case. Why could they not have just let us wait till the end, and asked us to put our cases in the hold? This would not have been an issue in the slightest.

Our flight was cancelled the morning of our flight and after talking to the easyJet staff we were told no flights would be available for the next 2 days including the day that we were intended to fly. The strange part was that there were other easyJet flights flying out of the same airport the same afternoon just a few hours after our flight was cancelled due to a ""strike"". We had reservations and plans booked in Venice in advance for this trip so we needed to get to our destination. There is no travel insurance that will reimburse you for your cancelled flight unless the entire airport was shut down due to weather - that leaves it up the the airline. Travel insurance will also not reimburse you for costs incurred due to the cancelation and will not reimburse for reservations that were ruined as a result. There was no offered compensation or alternative option of travel offered by the airline. We were refunded the cost of our flight but that does not compare to that we needed to book tickets on an alternative airline which cost 9 fold. Pay 80$ now for a flight but pay 700$ at the door for an alternative flight. Thank you easyJet for this experience. Pay the extra money to book with a different airline and save yourself a headache.

We were seeking advise for our case allowance as we had to buy more clothes due to us not receiving our luggage, and we were told completely different things by two EasyJet colleagues. One told us that we could pay for the hand luggage and combine the weight (costing 7€) but the lady on the desk told us we would have to pay 45€.

Not the cheapest flights available but economy. We arrive at the airport 2 hours before flying, in plenty of time, clear security easily and go to the gate area to wait for a specific gate. 10 mins before the scheduled departure another passenger notices that the departure time has changed from 19.45 (imminently) to 17.50, no other information. This causes other passengers to check their app to discover, then relate to us, that the flight has been cancelled. Not delayed, just cancelled, and that the 17.50 departure is the next day, Saturday. Savvy frequent flyers rushed off, knowing what to do, some even got alternative flights with other airlines. We were left standing with no information and no instructions what to do. There were no EasyJet staff on hand to explain, to offer suggestions or just tell us where to go. Eventually we found an information desk and they directed us back out to the Departures hall (back through the Baggage Hall and Passport Control) to the EasyJet check in guest where the other 150 or more passengers were waiting to find out what they were going to do. I waited in the queue for about 90 minutes to get to the front to be handed a piece of paper with the name of a hotel on it and the next day's flight details. It took them 30 seconds to give it to me. When I asked why they didn't just hand that out to the whole queue the poor desk staff, (who were not EasyJet staff just local airport representatives), said sorry the 40 rooms they had at the airport were full so we had to go back into town. So a train back in Amsterdam, a taxi to the hotel (which was very nice) but no meal as promised by EasyJet and by then the kitchens were closed. The next day our replacement flight is the last one out of Amsterdam, not the first or anything else during the day. The amazing thing is that there are no EasyJet people to talk to. None of the staff are theirs, not the check in or the gate staff. They know EasyJet are rubbish so they are practised at apologising. Don't fall for the cheap price, it's not worth it. The delays are inevitable, the cancellations random and the service non-existent. Pay a little bit more to know that when it does go wrong, as it will, there is someone there that can help you. The next day I had downloaded the app in order to check in on line. Using the flight tracker I could see the incoming flight from Alicante. Maybe the day before it came from somewhere else but the method is; plane comes in, offloads passengers then gets sent on somewhere else. The Friday flight was cancelled due to 'a staff welfare issue'.  Whatever, it must have been known about on the other flight, for some time, to allow then to make alternative arrangements for a spare pilot, 2nd officer, navigator?, cabin crew. But no, EasyJet don't do that because they care more about the bottom line than customer service. About 180 passengers on an A320 Airbus. Each passenger entitled to a minimum of 250 euro compensation plus hotel rooms, transfers, food etc, could cost them 63,000 as a conservative estimate for 1 cancelled flight. A lot more than the cost of one or two spare crew on standby. I learn today that Amsterdam is an EasyJet hub airport. But it doesn't matter to them, the only thing that matters is bums on seats.

Due to a tail wind we arrived in Pisa 90 minutes ahead of scheduled. The return flight into Gatwick was of a high standard and the cabin crew seemed very professional and exceeded customer expectations. Again the cabin service was slick and polished.

I used to work for an airline and I know how the system works with EasyJet, so I know that every flight has a no show percentage, but I do not expect to need to have luck to board a flight with a normal ticket, purchased more than 4 months ago. I had two options ahead of me: 1 wait till the end of the boarding even if I had a ticket already - 2 in case there was no seats available, getting a hotel room and wait time to be refunded, and leave the morning next. Both solutions were for me ridicolous as we are talking about tickets that I purchased more than 4 months before, considering the fact that I needed those tickets to get back home in Berlin. As I expected there were around 15-20 empty seats on board, but still I had to wait till the end of the boarding, so in the end I board the flight but still, this is unacceptable.",negative,-0.439713,0,24,8.761707,5.857933

We were never informed of their monetise the baggage policy, until we arrived at the boarding gate, and could no longer transfer stuff into hold cases. My 76 year old wife was charged ?48 because her cabin bag, which she has used for years and years had become 1"" too long, because Easy Jet decided to cash in by making a new ""rule"". They have done this, knowing full well, and in complete contravention, of the decision by the European Parliament's Committee, to now enforce a cabin baggage rule made in 2014. The European Court of Justice refers to airlines' varied size and weight standards for hand baggage, hidden fees, and misleading consumers about the true cost of air travel. The explanation given, was that the bag was a flight safety hazard, in the event of the aircraft being evacuated. However, by paying Easy Jet ?48, the bag was no longer a flight safety hazard, apparently. The other explanation given was that it would not go under the seat, but would have to go in the overhead lockers, designed for that purpose. Which, of course, was exactly what always happened before Easy Jet changed their rules. Incongruously, prior to take off, cabin crew (quite correctly) ask for any significant items to be stored in the overhead locker. Now, if that isn't misleading and monetising customers, then I don't know what is. Easy Jet may seem like a cheap option. It isn't. If you have a problem, and there are often problems travelling, Easy Jet will do nothing to help you. Better, much better, simply fly with a reputable airline.

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hurghada to Gatwick,24-May,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,3,"  I have been travelling for 5 years, between Hurghada/Gatwick, approx 7 - 8 times per year. I am sick to death of this airline, but unfortunately have no other option of another direct flight, since WizzAir stopped their flights. I need wheelchair assistance which I always book in advance, yet, I am never provided with the service they claim they can provide. The wheelchairs provided in Hurghada airport are all broken & on arrival 3 weeks ago, I was dumped on a seat at the far end of the arrivals corridor & completely abandoned for 35 minutes, until the pilot & crew came past & asked if I was OK. I explained the situation & they kindly went to find a porter with another wheelchair to rescue me. The porters always demand a tip & often rummage through my purse, dictating to me which notes they will take for this 'free special assistance service', whilst also asking me for some of my painkillers, pens, sweets etc. The porters only provide a wheelchair service after you have queued to get into the airport, queued to have your passport check, queued to get through the first x-ray & bag/body searches, 2nd bag search & checked your bags in. They only wheel you to the gate, not down the gangways to the plane, so you are left standing in queues to board the plane for 30 - 45 minutes. My flight back from Hurghada on Sunday 26th May was delayed for over 26 hours & absolutely no special assistance was provided at all to disembark the plane, when the pilot decided to abort take off. I was left to struggle all the way back through the airport again & onto a bus which drove us all the way out to a hotel in Sahl Hasheesh, then struggle to offload my luggage from the bus & in the pitch black, at 4am, all round the huge hotel complex, to my room. No Easyjet rep made an appearance & I only knew when the bus was coming to pick us up to take us back to the airport, through rumours from other passengers. It is also infuriating that on every flight back to the UK from Hurghada, they never have any food. Only 7/10 flights to Hurghada have food available. I am diabetic & had arrived at Hurghada Airport at 6pm for my 8.45pm flight on Sunday. The 1st delay was apparently due to the plane arriving late from the UK. The 2nd delay was apparently due to a crew member being sick & the 3rd delay, was due to a technical issue with 2 of the 3 plane's communication systems as we were taking off. We were all sat on the plane, on the runway for over 2 hours, with no food or drink, only half a plastic cup of warm tap water each. We reached the hotel we were bussed to at approx 3.15am, but there was no food or drink available. All the restaurants were shut. The first opportunity to drink anything was from the minibar at 4.45am, once I had struggled alone to my room. Still, no food had been provided at all. I was feeling extremely unwell by then & tried to call Reception using the phone in the room, but it was broken. The next thing I remember was waking up at about 12.10pm. I struggled to get up & outside to try to find something to eat. Luckily, I came across a fellow passenger who escorted me to a restaurant for lunch. It was the fellow passenger who told me where the nearest pharmacy was & the rumour she had heard about a bus picking us up at 6pm. Arrived at the airport for our 10pm flight, which was delayed until 11pm. Again, no food on the flight.

Eventually they opened up more desks but took nearly an hour to drop off bags. Next was security, queued out again with only a few channels open. Took a further 25 mins to get through this. Then passport control, once again queued out with only a couple of desks open. I suspect had our hotel transfer not been early we could have easily missed the flight as we only ha a short time after arriving at the gate before boarding started.

My son is a full-fare paying passenger (although less than 16 so I am writing this on their behalf). After boarding and takeoff as normal, the seat was momentarily vacated. A passenger in the same row lay down and started to occupy the seat. Neither my son nor I were asked for consent or even informed of this action. All I could tell was a passenger who looked as though they were recovering from a heavy night and wanted a lie down to recover. To enable this, my son had to sacrifice their seat for an indefinite length of time. I raised my issue with the aircrew. My concern was passed between two cabin crew and escalated to their superior. I was told that as I'd momentarily vacated, I had to maintain this status quo and sacrifice my son's seat. No alternative was offered. No timeframe was given. The only option I was presented was for both my son and I to squeeze into the same seat. It transpired the situation lasted for the majority of the flight. The FAA states ""The safest place for your child ... is not in your lap"". Yet this is the situation I found myself in and had to try to explain to my son. When I escalated my concerns, the best the senior cabin crew could offer was advice I should write to customer services and request a refund for my son's seat. I followed this advice.

Bordeaux departure was mess, it says Billi L on the boarding pass, but who would know that that meant a shed at the end of the main terminal that was for low cost airlines - all the Departures signage coming from the hire car drop zone is to the main terminal in the opposite direction. At bag drop there was initially only 1 person sitting at a desk who was more interested in talking to colleagues rather than check in passengers' luggage. Then 2 more arrived and a panic to pull forward passengers travelling to Palma and Marseilles. The last member of our party was charged 45 euros for excess baggage despite having the same baggage as on the outbound flight. The rest of the boarding procedure was an equally overcrowded, hot and unpleasant experience. Why not use the main terminal, especially now it is about empty following France's partial domestic flight ban. Low visibility at Bristol resulted in an aborted landing followed by diversion to Cardiff. The crew were excellent, they kept us informed throughout, the captain stood at the front of the cabin and gave updates directly.

First, I should note that the easyJet terminal at Schipol Airport is separate from all other airlines and has inadequate seating and very limited services. My flight from Amsterdam to Naples was canceled about 30 mins before the departure time, without any prior notice whatsoever that there might be any problems. There were no easyJet staff available to explain what to do. Asking other passengers with previous experience of easyJet cancellations was the only option. I went to the easyJet desk in the baggage claim area but the staff did nothing to help the stranded passengers. Recovering my checked package took 2 hours. After a long delay, the easyJet app offered the option to rebook on another flight, but in fact there were no other flights to Naples, Rome or Milan during the following two days.

Whilst bag-drop was straightforward and easy, getting through passport control was a total nightmare. At least a couple of hundred passengers were trying to reach the immigration booths at the B gates but were prevented by doing so by temporary barriers erected ostensibly to control the crowds but which instead resulted in passengers being kettled and trapped in scary conditions (i.e. risk of being crushed and little to no working air conditioning). One could argue this is the airport¡¯s responsibility rather than the airlines¡¯, but both Ryanair and jet2 sent their staff to the barriers to allow ONLY their passengers past the barriers; easyJet passengers were not allowed through and had to wait for other airline passengers to pass through and then slip through behind them whenever they could. EasyJet did not send down any staff to advocate for their passengers stuck behind the barriers and it was the most chaotic crowd I have ever seen waiting to be stamped out of any country. As a result, our flight was delayed by one hour simply because half of the passengers were still waiting to clear passport control (I overheard one of the ground staff confirm this to the cabin crew after I had been able to finally board). The flight itself was fine, but the experience at Naples airport was harrowing and it was upsetting to see how other low cost airlines bothered to get their passengers passed the barrier whilst easyJet staff were nowhere to be seen.",negative,-0.854276,0,28,8.552367,5.783825

On my last trip there's this staff member in LGW, not very presentable, checking the boarding passes - he asked many travellers to insert their baggage in a tiny space to verify the measurements; if it was half an inch bigger than that, then he tells the travellers that would be ?48 extra charge.

Afterwards I received a confirmation email saying the flight departs in Prague and flies to Milan. After I saw that email I immediately called EasyJet's customer service which was more useless. First he told me that there are no flights from Berlin to Milan at all and that I cannot change my flights at all. When I advised him that the airport is called Milan LIN that EasyJet planes fly to from Berlin, he told me that it would be cheaper for me to just make a new booking as it would be cheaper. However, I would still have to pay for those wrong flights from and to Prague since the booking has been made more than 24 hours ago. I asked him if there are any exceptions because obviously there must be a mistake (and it's possible that this mistake was made by the airline, because why would I book a flight from Prague) but he told me there's nothing that he can do for me. I went online and changed the flights on the website myself. There is no option to change both flights (there and return) at the same time, so I had to pay rebooking fees twice. Moreover there were no suitable return flights available anymore that leave in the evening, so now I had to take one a day later and have to pay for another night at the hotel. All in total I've paid now close to $900 AUD for flights + extra night at the hotel in Milan for one short trip from Berlin to Milan and return, because most likely there is some sort of bug in the system (either skyscanner or easyjet).

Boarding was via stairs and those allocated to board at the rear of the plane boarded as normal whereas those allocated to board via the front stairs were made to queue for around 15 to 20 minutes, standing on the tarmac. Later I discovered by chance that this was to allow a disabled passenger to be loaded first. This is understandable (and I don't mind waiting for that reason) but the failing of easyJet was that they did not communicate this reason to us whilst we were standing in the queue, not knowing what was going on.

At one point it seemed as if we might be 4 hours delayed but in the end we were less than 90 minutes delayed, which was good considering how many other hundreds of flights were cancelled and thousands delayed. We were told to check-in at the usual time; there was no queue at the airport for baggage drop. Staff were friendly, though no explicit mention was made of the likely delays! Boarding was a little chaotic as it required buses to transport everyone from the terminal to the aircraft (so anyone with speedy boarding would have only have had a marginal advantage, if any).

? Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Milan to Gatwick,23-Jul,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," I am writing to express my deep disappointment and sheer frustration with the appalling service I experienced during my recent flight with EasyJet on 20th July 2023. My journey with your airline, on Flight EZY8312 from Milan Malpensa to London Gatwick, was an absolute nightmare from the very outset. To begin with, all the electronic check-in gates at Milan Malpensa Airport were either out of order or deliberately switched off, resulting in an infuriatingly slow and chaotic process. It was quite an ordeal to witness the incompetence of the ground staff, and to add to the misery, there was only one overwhelmed lady dealing with the needs of over three hundred passengers. It is beyond comprehension how an airline of EasyJet's stature could allow such a woefully understaffed situation to occur. Unfortunately, the frustration did not stop there. Upon reaching the departure gate, I was greeted with the distressing sight of an obviously intoxicated and vulgar man causing a commotion at the bar. It was abundantly clear to anyone with basic judgment that this individual was in no condition to fly. He then proceeded to wander around the terminal, rudely interacting with both staff and passengers, while attempting to light a cigarette. The potential safety risk he posed to everyone on the flight was glaringly evident, and I was utterly shocked to witness the inaction of the EasyJet staff in preventing him from boarding the plane. As time passed, the intoxicated passenger's behavior grew increasingly aggressive towards anyone who dared to approach him. Astonishingly, the gate staff checked him in without any regard for the safety of the other passengers, allowing him to board the plane despite the obvious risk he presented. I was among the last passengers to board, and the atmosphere on the plane was one of fear and discomfort as this individual continued to disrupt and behave aggressively throughout the flight. Only after an excruciating two-hour delay and numerous complaints from concerned passengers did the decision to call the police to remove the intoxicated man from the flight finally come about. This delay was further compounded by the lack of clear communication from your staff. Even the pilot expressed disbelief at how this man was allowed to board the plane in his inebriated state. The incident not only caused unnecessary distress to passengers but also created an unprofessional and unsafe environment that is wholly unacceptable. The apparent indifference of your staff towards the welfare of your customers and their failure to act promptly in such a dangerously evident situation is deeply reprehensible.",negative,-0.84771,0,28,8.552367,5.783825

We were then taken from the plane and led through everyone that were awaiting to board other flights like refugees it was embarrassing, when we got to the Swiss port info desk we were then told that easyjet do not have an information desk at the airport anymore, so there was no easyjet rep to explain anything! We were then led to the luggage retrieval belt to wait on our luggage which took a further 2 hours to come out, whilst waiting I noticed young children crying and elderly people so tired and stressed out lying in corners deflated. We were informed by the easyjet app that our whole holiday had been cancelled and we can apply for a full refund (which I'm still awaiting on) and we could claim for compensation. This is were the plot thickens. We got home after 12 hours of stress the next morning I filled in a claim for compensation only to be told a day later that we our not entitled to any because the plane was grounded due to damage on the tyre! Well if that was the case why leave us on damaged plane for 5 hours? This is easyjets legal loophole to get away without paying out compensation claims. I sincerely hope they go bust because in my opinion this company are just about greed, making as much money as they possibly can without a thought of the stress and anxiety that they put hard working families that have promised their kids a great holiday only to have that dream shattered.

? Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Split to Manchester,23-Jun,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  easyJet left us stranded abroad twice with no money, food, clothing, hotel or way home. They turned off all methods of communication, didn¡¯t answer phone lines and put the phone down on customers. They have no staff in the airports and will tell you to pay for your own expenses and claim back, which they will then deny. They have cost us thousands and haven¡¯t been in touch with us at all. They¡¯ve even blocked our social media comments.  We were supposed to return to the U.K. on the 23rd from Croatia, and so we headed to the airport for our flight from Split to Manchester. We sat for hours in the airport, and noted delay after delay. During the delays, we received no updates from staff, only learning of delays from the easyJet app by checking manually and we were given no food or water. It¡¯s suggested that you should receive vouchers for the delay, but we never did and it would have gotten you a quarter of a bag of the cheapest chocolate from there anyway. Duty free was incredibly expensive and limited, as were the facilities. We sat there for hours and after lots of delays with no communication, easyJet cancelled the flight without notifying us and left everyone stranded in the airport with no help or guidance. The flight appeared as cancelled 40 minutes before the staff decided to make a tannoy announcement. You were left to rebook the flights through the EJ app; there were none for days and they booked up quickly so our group had to split and take whatever was available, paying for the hotel and other costs out of our pocket. The next direct flights weren¡¯t for days, and the other flights were all connecting ones to various places across Europe (Amsterdam, Milan, Rome) etc and not only were they with huge layovers, there were not enough seats on any of them, and also experienced the problem of being during the following days. Our smaller group had taken the Croatia to Milan connecting flight option, as we had group members with limited medication and health issues which we decided were the most important people to get to the U.K. earlier. We were unhappy with all the travelling time but it was the fastest option back into the U.K and we would have been trapped abroad for weeks otherwise, rather than days, so we were left with little choice. As there was no contact from easyJet and the staff were unhelpful, we also had to find a hotel at 11:30pm at night and then also find a way to get to it. Due to the timings, we had no food or water, and no breakfast but due to the dwindling amount of supplies and money we had on us, we had to keep our morning flight to Milan without being able to access any clean clothing or supplies. We did contact our travel insurance but as it was nearly midnight they were closed, and the next day they were completely unhelpful too as they state it is an issue for easyJet to resolve first, so they cannot and would not help. We went through the airport as normal the next day, and boarded our flight.

? Trip Verified ,A321N,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Funchal to Lisbon,23-Jun,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Flight EJU7628 FNC-LIS was originally scheduled to leave at 22:00 on 02.06.2023 but was considerably delayed until 00:00 on 03.06.2023. The boarding staff at Funchal then informed that the flight had been cancelled. All passengers had already shown their boarding card and identification document. The boarding staff did not give any reason for the cancellation, only that they had just been informed. easyJet did not volunteer to send any messages during this hiatus. Legitimately outraged passengers shouted insults and kicked the easyJet queue separators. easyJet had a crew strike scheduled for 03.06.2023 from 00:00 but claims the ""delay"" [cancellation], was due to problems with the control tower, which is highly dubious because the TAP, Ryanair and SATA flights landed after the easyJet plane from Lisbon at 23:10 on 02.06.2023, without any disruptions. It was reported that easyJet had been transferring planes from European bases to Portugal with non-Portuguese crew, this combined with the strike in Portugal I believe was the real reason for the cancelation or delay, so the crew exceeded flight times. Despite appearing on the movement panel of Funchal airport as a cancelled flight, having in my possession and that I attach, photo with date and time watermark, besides the visible time on the panel itself, that the flight was cancelled. At this moment, abandoned at Funchal airport, I am forced to rebook a flight to Lisbon as soon as possible, which cost me an extra expense, inherent to easyJet's lack of professionalism, of 312.99 euros. Everything lead me to believe, with no room for doubt, that the flight was cancelled. Only at 01:30 of 03.06.2023, when I had already been forced to reschedule my trip due to easyJet's total lack of diligence, does easyJet send an SMS that the flight was rescheduled for 12:00 of 03.06.2023, 14 hours after the scheduled and original departure of the flight. easyJet did not provide the possibility to accept or refuse the rerouting, they only changed the booking and checked in by myself, without any consent, whether I accepted the new flight, wanted a cash or voucher refund. Under the terms of Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, of 11 February 2004, I am entitled to compensation for the 14-hour delay I suffered - if it is not correctly considered that this was an effective cancellation - to the value of at least 250.00 euros plus the expenses incurred with the need to rebook on the nearest flight (312.99 euros), since easyJet had not informed passengers until 1.30 am on 3 June 2023. This makes a minimum total of €562.99, which I will never give up. Beware of this company.",negative,-0.830475,0,28,8.552367,5.783825
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Gatwick to Naples,23-Jun,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  If you want to travel to EU from London, I'd suggest you use any other company. I flew to Naples on the 3/06/23. The flight landed in a different airport from what it should have been - we were informed halfway through the flight that we had missed NAP closing time by 6 minutes, and had to land in Milan (800km away) instead. Surely, EasyJet would have checked with Naples airport that we were ok to land at the ETA to authorise departure. I'm sure that, where there's a risk of missing closing time by 6 mins as we were told, the considerate & reasonable thing to do would be to cancel the flight. I have reasons to believe that this was not done so that the incident could be marked as ""exceptional circumstances"", so that EasyJet could get away with not refunding passengers as per its refund policy. So either the staff was so na?ve as to not consider that flights can miss closing time by 6 mins, or this was deliberate fraudulent behaviour. Either way, it was unacceptable. EasyJet kept us waiting 5 hours at the airport, before boarding us and only then diverting our plane. We were also promised that EasyJet would provide accommodation and alternative transport, only to find out after 2 hours' wait that no, this would not be provided and we would have to think for ourselves. I was going to Naples to attend a wedding, which I missed. I cannot think of anything that would repay me not only of the financial cost, but also the time waste (the whole trip took me 21 h), and the psychological stress the company has deliberately inflicted on me.

? Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Luton to Edinburgh,23-Apr,3,3,,,,1,1,no,1," I am writing to denounce my profound regret regarding my flights with easyJet. Customers try to choose EasyJet because they are low costs but the hidden fees and the staff behaviour made me spend with easyJet really more than other airlines such as Air France or Lufthansa. I think that easyJet has many problems including the fact that a flight can only be changed for an important cost (?49) when it is within two months (who will book and change a flight before two months?). Hence the change would represent twice the price of the flight price. However, I am writing regarding a specific issue. Yesterday, I had two flights with easyJet, the first from Lyon to London Luton and the second from London Luton to Edinburgh. Three days before my flight I bought the right to have a large cabin bag (that cost me ?47 for the first flight and ?15 for the second one). Everything was OK with the first flight where I had my cabin bag with me in the cabin (where its place should be). However, in London Luton, the staff member at the check-in desk forced me to pay 48 additional pounds for the same cabin bag with a 10.9kg weight (in order to check it in as hold luggage). Please note that the same bag fitted really well on the plane for the first flight (from Lyon to London Luton). Moreover, I observed that other passengers had cabin bags larger than mine. Hence, today I observed that easyJet staff are not coherent in imposing additional fees to customers from one country to another. Also, they are not treating their customers in the same manner. I initially paid around ?22 for this flight. In the end, it cost me ?85: ?22 (initial payment) + ?15 (Large cabin bag ) + ?48 (when they forced me to check in the large cabin bag that was supposed to come with me in the cabin) In addition to this, you can read on the news every day about the high rate of delays and cancellations of this airline. Don't underestimate the stress that can be caused by this airline. Also, it has plenty of other low costs around that do not have such bad reviews from customers.

We have in the past used Ryanair occasionally but once they started seating couples separately if they did not pay for seats we ceased to do so. EasyJet suits us perfectly and flies to the places we want to visit. We were apprehensive when the rules / charges relating to baggage taken on board were changed, but we experimented flying with backpacks only which will fit under the seats in front and found that we could easily manage with those for a week's holiday. Since then we have happily travelled lightly and found it very easy indeed. We actually registered the fact on our most recent trip that is the ""Speedy Boarding"" passengers who now rush to queue when the boarding staff appear because they want to make sure of finding locker space as close to their seats as possible. The rest of us who have not paid extra for anything can just wait and board at our leisure. I can't recall more than one major delay in all the years we have used easyJet and just a few minor ones. On our last trip earlier this month both the outward and inward flights left and arrived slightly early. Flying out from Liverpool as we invariably do, we find it very rare that there is any nitpicking about bag sizes (despite some of the bags that we sometimes see!) and the whole process of flying with easyJet for us is relatively relaxed. It obviously helps that we know the ropes and that we keep abreast of any rule changes e.g. regarding baggage. It does seem to me that some of the critics fail to check on things like this and therefore are at least partly to blame when faced with charges they did not expect.",positive,0.375859,0,28,8.552367,5.783825

I asked him, why, and he mentioned that doing it through the website is cheaper. The situation was ridiculous, even though I spent precious time chatting with him, EasyJet wants to charge me more because of their badly designed system. I wished I could do it by the website without expending more time. So I recommend to people to even booked passenger tickets separately and you can manage the options individually or book flight tickets with another company which has a better system, EasyJet tries to get as much money as they can from their loyal customers.

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Porto,22-Sep,2,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  At first, the ground crew manager came up to the passengers asking for volunteers to change to another flight (they would fly to Santiago de Compostela instead, and have a bus waiting for them to take them to Porto, and all they offered was a 500€ compensation, which is much less than what they should actually have to pay every passenger if no one took the offer and they had to refuse entry to passengers) as they mismanaged and overbooked this flight (even though they kept insisting on that it was an aircraft issue and they had to use a smaller one, while the people at the check in desks said clearly that it was overbooked). After that, the boarding process took ages, as some people had their passes invalidated due to the mentioned overbooking issue, meaning their seats (mine included) were unavailable. What's funny about this is that even people in rows as low as 10-15 or so had their seats invalidated. Anyway the boarding process took well over an hour for the lucky ones, all the while the ground crew was being extremely rude to people that didn't yet fully understand the issue, instead of explaining what they were trying to do to solve the issue (we passengers do not care how your worthless service screwed up the bookings, do not belittle us for not understanding what stupid excuses you make). Now for the unlucky ones that had their seats invalidated, we were put to the side while they tried to figure out what to do, all the while the ground crew kept insisting for us to take the 500€ and go on another flight or whatever, which I find extremely distasteful, knowing that all of us should be compensated much better had we been refused entry. Some people that were put to the side still accepted the offer, which in the end did make room for everyone else on the flight, after of course another hour or so of waiting. Now with all that said, I wouldn't have minded the issue as much if it weren't for the rudeness of the ground crew, the almost 2 hours of keeping us in the dark about what was going to happen to us, and the persistence of the ground crew manager to have us go to another flight, if you really wanted that to happen offer something better than just 500€, you know very well the compensation the airline would have to give us had we been refused entry. To add insult to injury, when at last the flight took off, we weren't offered anything at all in flight, not one measly bottle of water or a bag of chips or a small cup of coffee, nothing, absolutely worst customer service ever. As a bonus, the cabin crew hit my leg with the food/beverage cart while I was sleeping, admittedly I had my leg on the corridor, which I hadn't done on purpose or willingly, but instead of waking me up to move my leg, they just hit it and all I got was a ""Oh sorry sir"", then the attendant moved on like nothing happened. It only hurt for a bit, it's not like I want monetary compensation or anything for that, but yeah a cup of coffee could have made it up for almost everything.

Contacting easyJet to get some sort of reimbursement is a nightmare, apparently getting reimbursement for a delayed flight isn't possible, the reason given, because it was delayed. The delay according to EasyJet was extraordinary circumstances, according to our pilot these circumstances were EasyJet running an overfull schedule that Gatwick could not service, and EasyJet not having staff to service these flights. The impression I'm given by easyJet's communication then is that it's my own fault for having incurred additional costs on arrival because I choose to fly with EasyJet.

? Trip Verified ,A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Paris,22-Aug,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  I would like to report on a very unpleasant experience with a baggage inspector and in this context I would like to claim back the illegally collected fine of 29€. The whole thing happened on August 17th, 2022 at around 6:20 p.m. at Gate A38 of BER Airport, where I and my travel companion should have boarded flight EJU5539 to Paris Orly at 5:35 p.m. So the flight was already delayed. Shortly before passing the counter, a very unfriendly baggage inspector waved me out. He said my hand luggage was too big. It was a business case (see picture attached), which I have been using for years with EasyJet. On the baggage measurement system, it also fitted perfectly in terms of height and width. It only exceeded the thickness by a minimum of approx. 0.5 cm (which the baggage inspector had to indicate with a pen).  When I then took the suitcase to repack something for my travel companion, the employee yelled at me where I wanted to go. He threatened me it's too late, I have to pay or the luggage will stay here. After I still managed to take out a few things and the case continued to protrude slightly over the limit, I tried to explain to the employee that this is just air in the case and that the exact dimensions can be maintained by pressing lightly. The employee then slapped my hands and yelled ""hands off"" and threatened again that the suitcase had to stay here. Under this pressure, I paid in order not to miss the flight. I suspect that the employee deliberately wanted to play off his position of power. Unfortunately there is no way to counteract this. The customer service in particular treats the customers here like dirt. Either you get an email with an answer with copy & paste FAQ's or on Instagram it is claimed that unfortunately nothing can be done. (Where there is a will, there is a way? ) Hiermit m?chte ich von einer sehr unangenehmen Erfahrung mit einem Gep?ckkontrolleur berichten und in diesem Zusammenhang die widerrechtlich eingezogene Strafgeb¨¹hr von 29€ (siehe Kontoauszug) zur¨¹ckfordern. Das ganze spielte sich den 17.08.22 um ca. 18:20 am Gate A38 des Flughafen BER ab, an welchem ich mit meiner Reisebegleitung bereits um 17:35 auf den Flug EJU5539 nach Paris Orly h?tte boarden sollen. Der Flug war also schon versp?tet. Kurz vor passieren des Schalters winkte mich dann ein sehr unfreundlicher Gep?ckkontrolleur heraus. Er meinte mein Handgep?ckst¨¹ck sei zu gro?. Dabei handelte es sich um einen Business Koffer (siehe Bild im Anhang), mit dem ich schon seit Jahren problemlos mit EasyJet reiste. Auf der Gep?ckmessanlage passte er von H?he und Breite dementsprechend auch perfekt rein. Lediglich die Dicke ¨¹berschritt er minimal um ca. 0,5 cm (was der Gep?ckkontrolleur mit einem Kugelschreiber andeuten musste). Als ich dann den Koffer nahm, um etwas zu meiner Reisebegleitung umzupacken schrie mich der Mitarbeiter an wo ich hinwollte. Er drohte mir es ist zu sp?t, ich muss zahlen oder das Gep?ck bliebe hier. Nachdem ich es dennoch schaffte ein paar Sachen herauszunehmen und der Koffer weiterhin minimal ¨¹ber die Begrenzung ragte, versuchte ich dem Mitarbeiter zu verdeutlichen, dass dies nur Luft im Koffer ist und durch leichtes andr¨¹cken exakt die Ma?e eingehalten werden. Daraufhin schlug der Mitarbeiter auf meine H?nde und schrie ,,H?nde weg"" und drohte erneut, dass der Koffer hierbleiben m¨¹sse. Unter diesem Druck zahlte ich, um den Flug nicht zu verpassen. Ich vermute, dass der Mitarbeiter bewusst seine Machtposition ausspielen wollte. Leider gibt es keine M?glichkeit dagegen vorzugehen.

Filled out the claim form and the person had the nerve to say they wouldn't give us a refund because the flight was only 4 minutes late!

We had extra-legroom seats in one of the over wing emergency exit rows but the standard seats looked fine for someone my height (1.74 m). Space is helped by the thin seats, I was concerned on first sitting down that these seemed rather firm but they must be well shaped because I stayed comfortable for the 3hr50 flight.

We were advised that our original flight was cancelled due to crew sickness. Apparently easyJet had no standby crew available in order to allow our flight to Bodrum depart. No empathy was shown by any easyJet ground staff at Bristol.

Aweek before departure, we observed changes overnight in the restrictions introduced in Germany due to the prevailing pandemic. We have completed all the documents required by the German side so that our trip could take place. In addition, we checked the EasyJet app and EasyJet Hub every day to be sure that any additional changes would not affect our flight. The last change made to the Easyjet Hub took place on December 20. On the day of departure, the Easy jet staff responsible for boarding informed us that we would not be admitted to the flight to Berlin because we have Polish passports and we do not have a transit ticket (from Berlin Brandenburg airport to another airport). The situation was extremely stressful for us, because despite having all the necessary documents, we were refused a flight. We asked to contact the shift manager to confirm this decision, informing in advance that we had spent too much time trying to resolve the situation, which could result in the inability to change the flight (we could have changed the flight up to 2 hours before departure) we informed the staff that I am pregnant and this situation stressed me as well as my five-year-old son, yet we were told to wait for the manager's decision. After two hours, we have been informed that we would not be allowed to fly despite the documents we presented due to the fact that the staff interpreted the restrictions in their own way.

The hostess in an arrogant tone told me my baggage was too big. I had already changed my luggage for a smaller one, got rid of half my clothes and it was too big ! Only a small wheel got past the metal box, as deserted as the plane was and given the situation they could have clearly arranged a place for my baggage. And when I suggested to refund the cabin bag or at least reduce it from the price of the cabin bag that I couldn't use the condescending woman said and I quote ""You knew what you were doing by bringing this bag, it is your fault not mine"". I am filled with so much rage ,anger and even sadness. The way she spoke like I was some insignificant number, just another dumb client enraged me to the depths of my soul.

Our flight was over 5 hours delayed due to an air traffic control strike which we were informed about whilst on the plane already 2 hours delayed. We were originally booked on British Airways and they cancelled the night before, which means EasyJet would have known about the strike at the same time and failed to act accordingly (notify us or tell us there would be a delay). We were kept outside in the cold waiting to board for 30 minutes before the plane was ready, then we were kept on the plane for 4 hours without any refreshments and not letting us disembark to stretch our legs. Then we were let off the plane into the gate to buy some food, which we had to pay for ourselves and not given any vouchers. Finally, we were let back onto the plane and took off almost 6 hours after the originally scheduled take-off time. They then provided us each with a soft drink and bag of crisps - hardly something sustainable for a delay of over 6 hours. The pilot told us that they should not have treated us like this and urged us all to file a complaint and ask for compensation due to the fact that the airline failed to inform us of the strike prior to boarding/delays. The crew told us that we could not get off and refuse to take the flight if we wanted to receive compensation so we felt stuck in this regard.

The boarding process on easyJet is by priority (speedy boarding), but you need to make sure that you are ready as it is difficult to get overhead space to put your hand baggage if you are not ahead of the queue. We pulled back on schedule and arrived in Amsterdam on schedule. You have you want something to eat or drink on easyJet you have to pay, however that is ok as the service is fast and efficient.

A lot of trouble with Eurowings when it comes to being on time and canceled flights. Totally the opposite with easyJet - I had more than 20 flights with them in the last 6 months. No delays, no canceled flights, professional and friendly crew - quite often with a good sense of humor. The prices are super competitive and they also part of an exchange now to make flying more friendly for the environment - already included in the ticket price. With Lufthansa, you have to go to an own platform and it¡¯s complicated, takes extra time plus you pay on top without a tax benefit. easyJet is probably not the best place to work for the employees but it seems they have a good culture and the service is great.",positive,0.526984,1,25,8.03722,-6.984716

They have known well in advance, that the flight would be delayed but did not dare to inform passengers. They could not care less. We were also not provided any updates on the additional delay in the plane. We were just told they switched the planes. Such a behavior displayed is simply unacceptable and unprofessional.

On arrival at the gate I found there was a long queue into the ¡®room¡¯ where final boarding card and passport checks are carried out. Passengers were queueing out of the room and up two flight of stairs. There were signs for ¡®speedy boarding¡¯ but these were utterly pointless due to the overcrowding in the stairwell - the only staff on hand (who should have been marshalling this situation) were staff telling people that their hand luggage would have to go in the hold as the overhead lockers would be too full - fortunately this didn¡¯t affect me as the staff started this process well behind me at the back of the queue, which then started moving. On arrival into the room and managed to fight my way through to the speedy boarding lane - I was naturally the last person in this queue. When we boarded the aircraft I then found that there was no space in the overhead lockers anywhere near my seat (1B), mostly because they were full of hats, coats, handbags, scarves and other items which, if the cabin staff had any sense and were in any way proactive about the situation, could have been put under the seat in front. At the insistence of the particularly unhelpful male cabin crew member, I had to place my hand luggage, for which I had paid extra, in the overhead lockers about 10 rows back on one side and the other item about 13 rows back on the other. I asked him if he would be retrieving them for me on departure to which he replied ¡®no, I won¡¯t be getting them¡¯ - I already knew the answer and I knew equally well that this would mean that I would either have to fight my way upstream to retrieve them on landing, or wait for the entire aircraft to empty before going back to get them, which is the option I took which meant that I was the last passenger to leave the aircraft...from seat 1B - absolutely ridiculous.

I have also flown a few times with a small backpack (to put under my feet) and a carry on luggage no problem with other airlines. The counter staff seemed unsympathetic at all and was pressuring me to just pay the CHF 76 and move along, standing in front of me just saying that it was impossible that all the stuff would fit (when I was trying to put the stuff from the small bag to the larger one.) She even went as far as to suggest to me and another family that we won't be allowed to test the luggage dimensions again and just to pay the 76 francs. (That's nearly as much as the ticket itself!) Even, when I did manage to fit the small suitcase into the slot, she said that it had to be smooth fit and that it couldn't be squeezed in. I have never expected such strictness and unreasonable behaviour from airport staff before and I can only believe it was out of spite that she said this as she realised that I had actually been able to fit the backpack into the carry on suitcase. I even saw her pressure the other family to pay just because they had an iPad that was not in the carry-on. When I got on, there was more than enough space in the overhead lockers and I had intended to put my backpack under my feet in any case to save space. In the end, I was forced by the same staff member to throw out my slippers as again she claimed they were an additional item of luggage. Seriously? All it did for easyJet, in the end, was that there was no way I would pay such a money-grabbing 76 francs and it didn't solve their issue of overcrowded luggage as the now larger suitcase was taking up more space in the overhead compartment than if I had 2 separate ones, 1 above and the small backpack underneath my feet. All in all, I believe this to be an extremely frustrating experience for both myself and easyJet as a company which could have been much better handled with more reasonable and less spiteful staff members who could have been more professional with the way they handled customers. Would not recommend this airline if you are looking for a decent customer experience.",negative,-0.69875,1,25,8.03722,-6.984716

We followed the website protocol and booked 3 bags into the hold. We were well below the (combined) baggage allowance but preferred to play it safe rather than have hassle at the airport. Equally, none of us had wheelie suitcases but the kids and my husband had little rucksacks while I took a bag that fitted into the under-seat dimensions. As a result, we had no issues at the gate. On the return flight, they were asking everyone at the back of line, where we were, with wheeled luggage to check it into the hold but they looked at our bags and said 'that's fine'. I think that you just need to follow the rules with easyJet if you want a pleasant experience. Other than that, the flights themselves were great. Friendly pilots, very friendly cabin crew and an efficient service. We had onboard snacks and drinks and they were all very good. I don't think they were overly expensive but another time, we might take our own snacks to save a bit.

When all passengers was seated and ready to go,  the captain announced a delay of 1 hour and 30 minutes and we had to wait inside the plane.

Until 8pm I was not even sure if my luggage was located. Finally they¡¯ve found it at Luton airport. No info by email/sms. Someone at the call center told me that the bag is scheduled for a flight on Day 3 and should be in Seville at 11am. Day 3: I¡¯ve called easyjet early morning to figure out if the bag will be delivered today. Throughout the day, three people at easyjet provided me with certainty that the bag will be delivered today to my hotel in the afternoon, ¡°certainly today¡±. I was a fool to trust them again one can judge. If they could only inform me that they cant guarantee a certain day of delivery - I would have come to the airport myself and collected my stuff, without which I was stuck in a Spanish village with almost nothing to do as all my holidays were dependent on my sports equipment. Easyjet turned out to be  liars as the luggage has not arrived that day. Also, only after my complaint about no communication - they did send another update, after more than 48 hours. Day 4 At 8am I reached the call renter again and a person there told me completely different info, that they have handed my bag over to the delivery center and can¡¯t guarantee time of delivery. Why on Earth have not his colleagues told me the same info the day before?! All of them were assuring me to expect the bag in the hotel on Day 3. I was redirected to the local airport for more information. I¡¯ve been trying to call them for 3 hours (was even wondering if this was a holiday in Spain?). Only at 11am someone picked up and told me that I should not call every day to them, and they already handed over my bag to the delivery company and no longer have info on that. I asked them to provide me with the phone number of the delivery company so I can track my bag and they were not able to provide it. I felt completely lost, miserable and helpless to be honest. At 2pm I received email which stated that the bag was delivered - it was NOT. I felt they were kidding me. Called them again - they have informed that the bag should be with me at 5pm.

The outcome was a short stop at Cardiff to refuel during which the weather improved at Bristol and we eventually landed at our destination about 3 hours late. All through, the flight and cabin crew (Antonio was cabin manager) kept us informed and were calm and encouraging - dealing with a poorly passenger and someone who was stressed, 22 passengers who chose to get off at Cardiff and a subsequent security check of the plane.

After letting other women with totes and carry ons walk by she picked me out and asked me to open my carry on, put my tote in it, close it and fit it into the carry on size check boxes. My carry on is sold under description it  says allowed on EasyJet flights. When i did what she asked me to do my suitcase fit but i couldnt bend and lift the carry on again. When I asked for help she said she would come but made me wait until almost everyone had boarded. I asked her why she was being so mean to me while letting everyone else walk by with same or more luggage. No response. Instead of helping me she walked back to the line and boarded more passengers. At the end it was a kind young female passenger that helped me lift the carry on out of the size checking bars. She also commented on the employee's rudeness.  Because I was late in boarding despite having paid extra for a front row seat, my carry on ended up being stored 20 rows behind me. It will be fun finding it after landing. It is not that she asked me to check what is a standard rule at EasyJet but that she did not ask other with same or more weight to do the same so I was arbitrarily picked by her. I wish I had other choices when flying out of Bristol but Easyjet is my only option. I would really appreciate the company providing some common sense and empathy training to their customer-facing employees and ensuring that their rules are standard for all passengers, not just those an employee arbitrarily selects.

She then supplied us with two tickets from Manchester to Palma the next day for two of us to continue our holiday. When I asked how much I would have to pay she said that Easyjet would foot the bill.

So I don¡¯t understand the fact that was no space left. I found this very upsetting and disrespectful. This shows a completely poor attitude and a huge lack of moral and lack of professionality and lack of passion from the crew member. She might have had a tough day, maybe she was already on her second/third flight on her shift, but still: you get paid for it. It¡¯s your job, not mine.

My flight was delayed for 3 hours and 30 minutes. The explanation of the delay was due to weather conditions in the city of departure (Barcelona). In fact, it was raining in the morning by afternoon it was slightly cloudy and other planes were departing on time from Barcelona. I was trying to contact the airlines by phone but it was not helpful at all. No response. Online chat button did not work and moreover, it is only available till 8 pm. During the waiting time, a representative of the air company offered the passengers a voucher for only 4 euros (a meal is much more expensive in the airport). Furthermore, the information about the vouchers was on their website an hour before they really started distributing them. The most important that I was not able to be on time at a railway station in Paris because I needed to go by train to another city in France. Being a student and having a limited budget I lost the money spent on my train ticket.

Instead she rather just ran off a standard speech that the flight is not delayed and that I needed to go and find my wife. Once we had checked into the boarding area there were all sorts of pa announcements calling for late passengers. After this a PA announcement came stating the pilot was delayed in arriving so the flight was indeed delayed. I would like to give Easyjet a big fat zero for this customer service.

We felt our only realistic option was to book another flight for my husband and I as the likely hood of people not turning up for a flight in the school holidays was unlikely and likewise with easy jet putting on another plane. We spoke to easy jet about this and had to pay again! So we paid ?275 each return originally and then the new flight out because they over booked and wouldn¡¯t guarantee anything cost ?150 each. To say I am disgusted with the airline is an understatement. To not exchange our outbound flight for free as they over booked our seats that we paid for months before is beyond as is leaving clients with very little alternatives than to either cancel the holiday or re book flights.

We looked for someone from easyJet to ask for help but at that time the airport was deserted.

I sent the request for reimbursement of at least the taxi since no one will repay us for all the inconveniences attached to this delay ... but at least the out-of-pocket expenses.

This Friday I faced yet another 3 hour delay, I hear all those saying claim, but this doesn't return the time lost and away from my family. What it does do though is add an expensive ?50 taxi fare with other transport options closed at 2am. So, the moral of my story is, with a very delayed Friday the night prior I contacted easyJets plus and flight club that I have membership of hoping that I might be permitted to move my 9pm Sunday flight to an earlier option. I advised of the issues, very politely I add, the day before asking simply to take the plane 50mins earlier. Sure ?100 plus was the reply, so this is from an airline that has over ?5k of my money in flights booked through to march 2020, zero empathy, zero flexibility advising turn up early and take your chances like everyone else. So flight club and plus membership, let alone loyalty stands for absolutely nothing. Never once have I submitted an eu261 claim for the countless late arrivals and multiple taxi fares.

The speedy boarding option offered by easyJet is worth the price as it avoids long queues. It is also possible to book seats with extra legroom, providing all passengers are over 16. Of course, the price adds up and if you pay for hold baggage as well it can cost as much as a regular (not cut-price) airline. For us, the convenience of flying from Luton makes this worthwhile.

We went to the information desk and asked what to do next and we¡¯re pointed out of the waiting lounge to the EasyJet desk.

The next day we arrived for our flight, again 4/5 hours to spare. We got through security checks etc, and as soon as we got through to the waiting area our flight was delayed by an hour. It was then delayed further, and then delayed again and again. We waited for an extra couple hours and to our surprise we were given a gate to go to! We rushed to the gate, waited there for about 20 minutes, we were then told we had to wait for our flight to land and passengers to get off. We proceeded to wait. We watched the plane land, the passengers get off, bags being unloaded. Flights were taking off all around us. After watching all of this, everyone was getting agitated. Many people were surrounding the gate desk, asking what was happening. No one was getting a straight answer. Later we were told our flight was yet again cancelled for the second time. We then had to wait again for buses back to the baggage area. We made it back to the EasyJet desk with a queue of about 100+ people, all angry and upset. We waited for an additional 20 minutes before someone come out to speak to the passengers. One man at the front of the queue was very angry and started to raise his voice so the manager and employees walked away, back to the staff room I presume, and refused to speak to anyone because of one angry passenger raising his voice.

I was left stranded in Zurich near midnight (not familiar at all with Zurich) and told to figure out how I would get to my destination on my own. Here is the text from them: We're sorry that your flight has diverted to Zurich airport. This is due to the closure of Basel airport. The disruption is beyond our control and is considered an extraordinary circumstance. We're very sorry but due to high demand in Zurich we are unable to arrange onward transport for you. If you¡¯re able to make your own arrangements, we will refund the cost. Please retain all your receipts in order to make your claim. If you need any further assistance please speak to one of our ground crew in the airport who will be happy to help you. Note ""if you are able to make your own arrangements"" and ""one of our ground crew in the airport... will be happy to help you"" I found one of the ground crew and kindly asked them for help. They told me ""go catch a train"" (I remained very polite since I know it isn't their fault). I asked them where the train station was and if they could help me figure out which train .. they stated just walk straight and turn left you will see a train station (that is all they would say or do, I was left in shock) They offered no other assistance. I found the airport train station and because it was late at night no one was working there. I had to go to the automatic ticket machines. After struggling for 15 minutes I found out that to get to Basel I would have to take two trains and one bus, all of this in the middle of the night in a place I am unfamiliar with. Why couldn't they have at least given us a map and a guide to which trains we would need to take? This could have been very easy for them to print out and offer. When I arrived at Basel (after 2:00 am) I was informed that a KLM flight who was in the same predicament as my easyJet flight - diverted to Zurich., told their passengers to wait and when the storm moved past... flew them on to Basel. I would avoid this airline at all costs, they don't really care if you make it to your destination nor do they care about your  safety. I am still struggling to understand how they can drop you off in a different place and do nothing to help you get to your intended destination.

A lot of passengers made comments to each other, including the two passengers sat next to me, at how we had been spoken to. Now I fully understand that the safety briefing is extremely important and from time to time the cabin crew have to be firm with passengers to get their attention, but there is a difference between being firm with customers and being angry/aggressive.

Aircraft was spotless inside and Edinburgh based crew were friendly and welcoming to everyone. Comfortable window seat, decent leg room as I¡¯m 6¡±1, didn¡¯t feel claustrophobic on this full A320. Much better than the A319 on the Glasgow-Sch?nefeld outbound on the Thursday where I felt squashed in the window seat. Even though the boarding looked slow at the terminal side, this was completed quickly and soon we were on our way. Service was quick to commence and a reasonable selection of products available onboard. I had prepaid for a bistro voucher so took advantage of the hot meal deal which todays hot selection was the Ham and Cheese Croissant. Hot all the way through, and sufficient for an early evening snack along with a chocolate bar and Earl Grey Tea. Also had a few G&T¡¯s which was perfectly reasonable in terms of price, €14 Remember, these are served as double measures. About 3/4 of the way through the flight I went to pour my last gin when realised that during the trash run, I gave them the full bottle of gin rather than the empty one! So while heading to the back to the toilet, I had a laugh with the crew mentioning what I had done. To my surprise, one of the crew opened the recycling bag and had a quick check to see if the full bottle was amongst the trash. I did not expect that, and we had a laugh about it. No luck, which I assumed. During decent, the cabin manager was making her was from the back, stopped at my row and handed me over a g&t, they had found the full bottle, yet it was too dirty to hand back, so gave me a fresh one. That was well above what I expected! Landed 20mins ahead of schedule, as always lovely views coming into Edinburgh, but the time saved was ruined due to airport ground traffic and being bussed to immigration. Not easyJet¡¯s fault.

Personally, I find the free carry-on bag allowance pretty generous). The flight was delayed 30 minutes due to late arrival of the aircraft, which is still reasonable for any airline these days.

Tried to put all of the items in carry on bag for all 4 passengers. In order to avoid paying ?50 for each person, threw away two personal bags and stuffed all in checked in bags. Laptop, iPad, money bag and jacket was left in one personal bag. Representative insisted to stuff  all in 1 carry on because no personal items allowed. I showed her the board outside the boarding area, which says allowed personal items, she said, ""the board is not applicable to my ticket"". EasyJet was my connecting flight. We started with the same carryon on WestJet Airlines from Los Angeles to Calgary to Gatwick. Same carry-on with personal items was okay with WestJet but wasn¡¯t okay with EasyJet. Representative said each airline has their policy. I charged ?50 to my credit card and told her that easyjet will get 4 bad reviews today, she said, ""nothing she could do"". Now I¡¯ll have to go to baggage claim for the one of the carry-on's that were checked in, which will delay my plans in Paris.

Baggage took 30 minutes to arrive at baggage area. Uber ride started at 6.10, overall 1.5 hours lost.

Is there any governing body that could punish bad and intentionally fraudulent practices by airlines like EasyJet?

If yes, why did they announce at 1.35 that the gate is closing and made us run?

I assumed that this was an attempt to compete with other discount airlines like Ryanair, etc. We checked in on line, and while waiting at the gate to board, there was an EasyJet employee going through the line and picking people out of the line and charging them a 50 pound fine for having an extra bag. She got a number of people as she did this and had a machine at the ready to charge our credit cards. When I protested, she said that our personal items were too big, and that I should have read the terms and conditions more carefully. How many people do that? Without being a member of their ""Easy travellers"" group, it was the same as always, and we were ""fined"" 100 pounds because our personal items were too large. Had we known, we would have factored that additional charge into the cost of our flight, and would have likely flown with someone else as the EasyJet flight was much more than other airlines with the additional baggage cost, and they flew at inconvenient times, and into the nasty, old disused terminal at Sofia Airport. If someone makes you pay an additional 100 pounds to board a flight you have already paid for, there is no name for it other than theft, fraud or extortion.

There was one guy in an EasyJet uniform who was a passenger but was sitting in the best seats in the house given lots of free food by his over attentive friend (before anyone else was served). Subsided again by paying passengers? Regular passengers such as we were overlooked (the guy at the end of our row was asked if he wanted anything but we weren¡¯t).

Well these guys didn¡¯t like that and began denying everything. We held our ground and the off-duty guy became quite aggressive, almost shouting.

I told him I wasn¡¯t some weakling he could push around and at that point the pilot came out, ignored me and went to speak to my daughter- who was by now near the plane door and quite upset as she¡¯s a nervous flyer and these lunatics weren¡¯t helping.

We booked our flight two and a half months ahead of time, and when I went to check-in for my flight, the website had said I had to visit the desk when I arrived at the airport. Thinking there was no issue, I arrived at the airport for EasyJet to tell me that I did not have a seat on the plane. Her exact words were, ""You paid for the flight, not for a seat."" Apparently, people who pay 24 euros extra to choose their seat have priority in getting a seat on the plane over those who do not. So, since they overbooked the flight, I did not have a seat on the plane I paid for (and neither did my friend), but our other friend did and had to travel to Paris alone. A worker escorted my friend and I to a counter where we got a new reservation for a flight that was 5 hours later than our original flight. We did get a 9 euro voucher and ""speedy boarding,"" but overall a flawed system and do not recommend booking with EasyJet unless you want to pay 24 euros extra to choose a seat or want to run the risk of spending 10 hours (total) in the airport. We also had to go through security again after visiting the counter where they rescheduled our flight. That was fun.",negative,-0.649465,0,24,8.761707,5.857933

They wanted to charge us €60 per case to go in the hold. I felt humiliated and embarrassed, having to pull out personal items such as underwear etc in front of over 100 individuals who were getting on to the flight. There was no privacy provided to try and rearrange the bags. After re-arranging the bags, and managing to get everything in to the one bag, the crew in the airport then called to say that cabin bags could be put in the hold for free  as the flight was busy and they would need any space possible. They do this after watching us struggle to put our items all in to one small cabin case. Why could they not have just let us wait till the end, and asked us to put our cases in the hold? This would not have been an issue in the slightest.

Our flight was cancelled the morning of our flight and after talking to the easyJet staff we were told no flights would be available for the next 2 days including the day that we were intended to fly. The strange part was that there were other easyJet flights flying out of the same airport the same afternoon just a few hours after our flight was cancelled due to a ""strike"". We had reservations and plans booked in Venice in advance for this trip so we needed to get to our destination. There is no travel insurance that will reimburse you for your cancelled flight unless the entire airport was shut down due to weather - that leaves it up the the airline. Travel insurance will also not reimburse you for costs incurred due to the cancelation and will not reimburse for reservations that were ruined as a result. There was no offered compensation or alternative option of travel offered by the airline. We were refunded the cost of our flight but that does not compare to that we needed to book tickets on an alternative airline which cost 9 fold. Pay 80$ now for a flight but pay 700$ at the door for an alternative flight. Thank you easyJet for this experience. Pay the extra money to book with a different airline and save yourself a headache.

We were seeking advise for our case allowance as we had to buy more clothes due to us not receiving our luggage, and we were told completely different things by two EasyJet colleagues. One told us that we could pay for the hand luggage and combine the weight (costing 7€) but the lady on the desk told us we would have to pay 45€.

Not the cheapest flights available but economy. We arrive at the airport 2 hours before flying, in plenty of time, clear security easily and go to the gate area to wait for a specific gate. 10 mins before the scheduled departure another passenger notices that the departure time has changed from 19.45 (imminently) to 17.50, no other information. This causes other passengers to check their app to discover, then relate to us, that the flight has been cancelled. Not delayed, just cancelled, and that the 17.50 departure is the next day, Saturday. Savvy frequent flyers rushed off, knowing what to do, some even got alternative flights with other airlines. We were left standing with no information and no instructions what to do. There were no EasyJet staff on hand to explain, to offer suggestions or just tell us where to go. Eventually we found an information desk and they directed us back out to the Departures hall (back through the Baggage Hall and Passport Control) to the EasyJet check in guest where the other 150 or more passengers were waiting to find out what they were going to do. I waited in the queue for about 90 minutes to get to the front to be handed a piece of paper with the name of a hotel on it and the next day's flight details. It took them 30 seconds to give it to me. When I asked why they didn't just hand that out to the whole queue the poor desk staff, (who were not EasyJet staff just local airport representatives), said sorry the 40 rooms they had at the airport were full so we had to go back into town. So a train back in Amsterdam, a taxi to the hotel (which was very nice) but no meal as promised by EasyJet and by then the kitchens were closed. The next day our replacement flight is the last one out of Amsterdam, not the first or anything else during the day. The amazing thing is that there are no EasyJet people to talk to. None of the staff are theirs, not the check in or the gate staff. They know EasyJet are rubbish so they are practised at apologising. Don't fall for the cheap price, it's not worth it. The delays are inevitable, the cancellations random and the service non-existent. Pay a little bit more to know that when it does go wrong, as it will, there is someone there that can help you. The next day I had downloaded the app in order to check in on line. Using the flight tracker I could see the incoming flight from Alicante. Maybe the day before it came from somewhere else but the method is; plane comes in, offloads passengers then gets sent on somewhere else. The Friday flight was cancelled due to 'a staff welfare issue'.  Whatever, it must have been known about on the other flight, for some time, to allow then to make alternative arrangements for a spare pilot, 2nd officer, navigator?, cabin crew. But no, EasyJet don't do that because they care more about the bottom line than customer service. About 180 passengers on an A320 Airbus. Each passenger entitled to a minimum of 250 euro compensation plus hotel rooms, transfers, food etc, could cost them 63,000 as a conservative estimate for 1 cancelled flight. A lot more than the cost of one or two spare crew on standby. I learn today that Amsterdam is an EasyJet hub airport. But it doesn't matter to them, the only thing that matters is bums on seats.

Due to a tail wind we arrived in Pisa 90 minutes ahead of scheduled. The return flight into Gatwick was of a high standard and the cabin crew seemed very professional and exceeded customer expectations. Again the cabin service was slick and polished.

I used to work for an airline and I know how the system works with EasyJet, so I know that every flight has a no show percentage, but I do not expect to need to have luck to board a flight with a normal ticket, purchased more than 4 months ago. I had two options ahead of me: 1 wait till the end of the boarding even if I had a ticket already - 2 in case there was no seats available, getting a hotel room and wait time to be refunded, and leave the morning next. Both solutions were for me ridicolous as we are talking about tickets that I purchased more than 4 months before, considering the fact that I needed those tickets to get back home in Berlin. As I expected there were around 15-20 empty seats on board, but still I had to wait till the end of the boarding, so in the end I board the flight but still, this is unacceptable.",negative,-0.439713,0,24,8.761707,5.857933

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Venice to London,24-Jul,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"   I wish I had never sought to save money trying to book through this budget airline because I wound up spending over $830 for ¡°inexpensive¡± flights. My and my partner purchased flights from Italy to Malta, but changed it due to the heat wave happening. We switched to London and paid the $56 hour change fee even though the new flights were significantly less expensive than the original (no return of difference). No biggie. Then the day of the flight, we got to Marco Polo airport and realized our flight was from Treviso. Our mistake, but then we tried to change it online as you are supposed to be able to do (paying a change fee and fare difference if applicable each time). Could not do so on the website or app. Also could not connect to a chat agent, perhaps due to high volume. So we tried to find an agent at the airport and we wandered that place for about an hour going back and forth. First off, for some reason, there are no maps in the airport to tell you where airline ticket counters are located (there are three separate locations on two floors¡ª we went to all of them). Next thing is that that information is also not on the itinerary or RyanAir¡¯s website. We finally found RyanAir¡¯s check in counter and bag drop, but the agents could not change tickets! They said we had to purchase new ones. This is where I made a mistake because I was in a rush. I purchased the next day by accident because the flights I saw earlier sold out while we were trying to resolve the issue online and at the check in counter. We quickly checked in via the app and went back to the counter, where the agent realized we had the wrong date and THAT is when he told me I could go to a ticket counter upstairs to try to change my ticket. What! Why didn¡¯t he say that before and why are the check in and ticket counters in separate areas on separate floors? When I went upstairs (where there are multiple single booths that service various airlines, again you have to look for them as they are not clearly marked), the ticket agent said we could have paid a fare difference/change fee if we hadn¡¯t purchased the new tickets. Which was what we had tried to do, but couldn¡¯t and had been told by another agent to purchase new tickets. Of course they could not refund me and they suggested I contact RyanAir online to see if they could issue a refund. I reached out again to RyanAir via chat and at first received the message that they could not assist due to high volume and to try again. When I did so, I was placed 334 in the queue. Finally someone responded, I told them the situation and he said Passenger error, no refund because they could not make a change without cost or cancel. What did that last part even mean? I reiterated that I purchased new tickets instead of exchanging them because of the lack of online assistance and as directed by one of their agents and I wasn¡¯t looking for a full refund or cancellation of all flights, just either the cost of the original tickets or the current tickets to rebook with a change fee. I also asked what he meant by they couldn¡¯t change without cost or cancel, but the agent bailed and said he had to abandon the conversation since he told me all he could. I suspect it was because he couldn¡¯t actually explain what he meant in English. Oh and did you know if you don¡¯t check in online, you will get charge 55 euro per person to check in in person at the airport?

Then I contacted again later Ryanair and asked for refund or to book me for tomorrow (20th) but they responded that I was late for flight and that security at airport was to blame.

By that time, I had already checked in online for all passengers. I contacted Ryanair's call center and was assured by an employee that it was possible to replace the name without any costs and that the reservation would be unchecked to allow modifications. I was instructed to wait approximately two hours before logging in again to make the change. After waiting for three hours, I attempted to log in and make the changes but was unsuccessful. I contacted the call center again and was redirected to the Chat service. I waited in a queue of approximately 300 people for about four hours, only to be kicked out of the system without resolution. As it was very late and our flight was the next morning, I decided to address the issue at the Athens airport. On the morning of our flight, I attempted to contact the call center again, but it was out of working hours. Upon arrival at the airport, I sought assistance from Skyserv, who confirmed they were unable to make any changes and advised me to purchase a new ticket for the new passenger at the price of €437.96 which I did eventually. Skyserv assured me that Ryanair would refund the additional ticket cost due to the circumstances. Additionally, at Gate C15, security informed me that the original reservation was unchecked, and I had to pay an additional €55.00 for check-in. Both Skyserv and gate security confirmed that these issues were due to Ryanair¡¯s error and assured me that Ryanair would refund me for these amounts. Upon our return from Berlin on June 9, 2024, we encountered further issues at Gate B38, where the original reservation was not initially found on the manifest. After an internal investigation, he was allowed to board. From what we believe is when I spoke with Ryanair assistant in the first time, they unchecked the wrong reservation by mistake and this is why all this confusion incurred.

We arrived at the airport around 15:00. We entered the security checkpoint shortly after 16:00. Although there were not many people in line but the line was moving extremely slow. The security staff was disorganized, slow, taking their time to inspecting each and every item, reading each label, talking, laughing with each other during the process. None of the staff cared about getting passengers in a timely manner to ensure that people were able to make their flights. The personal was extremely unprofessional, lacked courtesy for passengers. Around 17:00, my daughter¡¯s bag was the fifth one in line to be inspected, she begged people to let her go next. Passengers were under extreme pressure, stressed. No matter how politely we begged to speed up the bag inspection process, the staff just looked at us and deliberately slowed down. After security, we ran through the maze of stores to the gate. It was 17:35, the gate was already closed. I could see the aircraft from the window for the next 20 minutes. After calming down, we tried to figure out the next step. We learned that our luggage was pulled off the aircraft and we needed to retrieve it from the arrival terminal. Ryanair knew that two passengers already checked in, the luggage was loaded but the gate was closed prior to the scheduled departure. We were told to go to Ryanair customer service, after explaining what happened the women just looked at us, didn¡¯t care. I asked her to check for availability for the next flight. She looked at me like I was bothering her. After a few minutes, she stated that the next flight with two seats was scheduled to fly out three days later. I asked for a refund instead but she said there will be no refund and that if we decided to book the next flight, we would have to pay again as a new reservations. I asked if she was able to check other airports around London with flights to Poland the next morning and she refused to help, stating that Ryanair does not do that. After learning that there was a flight from Luton airport via Wizzair the next morning, we decided to take multiple trains to Luton airport not knowing if there were seats available. We couldn¡¯t book this flight via our mobile phone because there was a problem with the network as our phones operates out of USA. That was our first time in London, we were not familiar with the train system, had difficulty with our phones but we took a chance and headed for Luton airport.

We check the suitcase in Menara 2 hours before the flight. We ask about checking in a rug wrapped in a cylindrical package 40 cm long and 23 cm in diameter and we are told that we can take it if we want as hand luggage because it meets the measurements. Once at boarding I carry a small backpack and the package and a Swissport worker approaches me asking if I have priority. I tell him no but that there are 3 of us and only two bags of permitted measurements. From there a surreal and unpleasant situation. They shout at us, coerce us and leave us aside. We try to finish it but either they don't understand us or they don't want to understand us. They shout us aside and tell us we can't fly. We tell them that we pay whatever it takes and they close the door on us and tell us that we are staying in Morocco. My daughter crying. In the end they agree to us giving them the VISA and they charge me what they want without giving me any receipt. They told me that they charged 50 euros and after checking it they charged me 70. They let us board because a Sevilla FC player came in behind us. Complaint upon return to Ryanair. At the Seville Airport the Ryanair workers agree with us and apologize. In the complaint on their website they lie saying that they charge me for checking in the suitcase out of time. The worst thing is not the money, it is the helplessness and the bad time they have put my family through. Shameful.  P¨¦sima atenci¨®n al cliente.

Then we get an email saying compensation claims under EU261 must be made via their online form -  can't be weather, then.

The Ryanair form has the option of refund in case of illness and my illness is also mentioned on the form options but after a long time of contact with Ryanair and explanations and sending the same requests via live chat, emails and form (which eventually didn't work) I managed to get the response from English customer service with the information that I am not eligible to get a refund. I bought a ticket with checked in luggage. I informed the airline immediately but customer service didn't treat my case seriously and it took about a month to get in touch with somebody. Only today when I contacted live chat again I learnt from the consultant that my case is being verified again but the lady said it will be probably negative. In the airline policy it's clearly mentioned that the refund is applicable in certain situations like serious illness and the need of surgery. I sent all the details and doctor opinions and I was informed I can pay a penalty and reschedule a flight for 45 euros. It was not explained why I am not eligible to get a refund despite the fact that the Ryanair's policy is clear. It seems that the Ryanair's policy is not applicable in the same way to all the clients and there's no explanation and contact from the site of the customer service unless you constantly keep trying to ask and send messages. The live chat is also very limited and the consultants say they have no information in this matter.

Please consider this a word of caution before booking with this airline. On December 2nd, 2023, I was scheduled to fly from Oslo Torp to London Stansted on Ryanair flight RK33. However, what followed was an unexpected and frustrating 5-hour delay. Throughout this ordeal, communication from Ryanair was virtually nonexistent. Passengers were left stranded, confused, and desperately seeking information. Despite my repeated attempts to seek compensation in accordance with EU Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, which clearly outlines passenger rights in such scenarios, Ryanair was dismissive of my concerns. Their responses were generic, devoid of empathy, and offered no meaningful resolution. It's worth noting that Ryanair also insisted on compensating passengers for food and drinks purchased during the delay. However, it's important to highlight that the options available at the airport were severely limited. Hot food or drinks were simply not accessible, leaving passengers with no viable alternatives other than a vending machine. I share this experience not out of spite but as a plea for better treatment of passengers by airlines like Ryanair. As travelers, we deserve transparency, accountability, and respect. I encourage you to weigh your options carefully before booking with Ryanair and to share your own experiences to help others make informed decisions. Let's advocate for better service standards together. Warm regards.",negative,-0.383014,0,39,9.506288,7.559038

I booked the seat with Ryanair several months before my planned travel and found the website clear and easy to use. Ryanair sent quite frequent emails relating to the flight and attempted to sell me extras. The check-in procedure was followed by a bag-drop at Faro Airport. This was not efficient and the app they recommended for speedy bag-drop did not work. Setting that aside, I was able to check-in my bag within less than 30 minutes of having arrived at the airport. Boarding was supposedly via group but this did not materialise at all. The cabin crew had a reasonable presence and delivered a serious safety procedure. During the flight the crew worked hard and had several rounds of drinks for sale. I found the seat suitable for a flight just under 3 hours. The flight departed on-time and arrived on schedule too. Disembarkation was delayed in Liverpool while this was not the fault of Ryanair, there was no communication with the passengers as to why this was the case.

Boarding no matter where is a shambles. You're invariably stuck in a freezing cold or roasting hot stairwell even before your aircraft reaches the gate. It's not a pleasant experience. Nowhere to sit. As budget airlines don't use jetties at the gate there is every chance that you're gonna get soaked going to and from the terminal in winter.

Even back then, we already calculated with a one and a half hour Ryanair delay, but that is just not good enough for that ""never on time airline"". To make things worse, according to EU law, they only have to pay compensation from a three hour delay, i.e. most delays go without any sanction, meaning a contribution from Ryanair for the additional expenses their customer have to pay. Long live neoliberalism? Add to that the non-existing Ryanair customer-sevice, which leaves you in the dark about new departure time, gate changes etc, and you have the worst package you can possibly buy. What can we customers do about it? At first, let us please stop buying drinks, food and other items on flights that come with more than half an hour delay.

They made up 20 minutes and the plane landed at Leeds Bradford 40 minutes behind schedule. Absolutely no complaints whatsoever and fantastic value for money.

Surely it is to assure everyone is there, can board quickly and enable the closing of the doors of the plane on time, but is quite a torture (many other airlines try to avoid such thing, probably with more differentiation of boarding groups).

? Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rabat to Rome,23-Aug,1,1,,,,2,4,yes,6," I would like to point out that the airline is a 'Budget airline' and it's pretty popular in Europe and north Africa, and RYANAIR is the most well known of them all for various reasons (mostly negative). BOOKING AND CHECK-IN: To book your flight like every other airline you do it online, through their website or their own app, booking a flight is easy enough and the first thing that will surprise you is how cheap tickets can get, some goes for less than 20 Euros, and many of them don't go over 100 Euros (depending on when you're booking), although that's very good you soon realise why the airline is hated, as when you choose your ticket you're bombarded with fees left and right for everything else besides the ticket. You have a big bag you want to take with you? That would be 30€ extra. Want to bring a small cabin bag? You can only do that by buying priority Which is at least 25€...etc the only thing you can bring is one backpack for free that weighs less than 10kg. They also try to sell you on offers such as compensation etc, but for the most part it's absolutely not worth it, so don't spend your money on them. In terms of checking you can do it for free only when there's less than 24 hours left on the flight online, if you come to check in at the airport you'll be charged 30€ for them to check-in for you and give you the boarding pass, so keep that in mind! WAITING AND BOARDING: It's the day you take your flight! Remember that when you get through security, to look at the departures carefully, because 3 times out of ten they will change their gate (that's if they show you the gate early, they usually show it until there's less than an hour for the planes departure), stay alert! After that you during boarding you must wait until it's your turn (if you don't have priority) and go to your plane! In the boarding pass you printed or given they will tell you where to board, because Ryanair uses both the front and the rear for boarding people, and rarely use normal gates. After you've boarded, sit, relax if you can, because the seats aren't the best and they aren't reclinable. The food is also not free so if you want anything you have to pay (they also don't accept cash, only cards). END OF TRIP: And there you go, you've survived the trip with (hopefully) little to no extra money spent! All and all as much as this review is negative in many aspects, to be completely fair you get what you pay for, if you know what you're doing already and/or made research to be prepared you shouldn't have any problems! It's a very good airline for the fact they give such cheap tickets to people like me (a student) who can't afford ""big airlines"" and can go with only a backpack! It's also a different story if you go with your family or friends as in my situation all my flights in Ryanair were solo! Just watch out for their scummy behaviour to extract more money and try to not book the flight on third party websites. For me I'll give it a solid 6/10 because for many people like me the airline is a life saver, but it's definitely not for everybody to use.",negative,-0.50969,0,39,9.506288,7.559038

On our flight from Berlin to Venice, we were re-routed and had to land in Verona about 1.5 hours from Venice (Treviso) due to a major storm. Ryanair has no ground staff to assist people which is why they can be 'budget'. We landed late at night and 3 other Ryanair flights also landed in Verona due to the storm. There was a very nice lady employed by Verona Airport who was helping all the Ryanair customers. We were told to wait for buses arranged by Ryanair to take people from Verona to Treviso airport. People were fighting to get on the buses and we didn't understand why anyone would behave that way, considering Ryanair must surely know exactly how many buses they need to send based on how many flights/passengers had landed. Well, we were wrong. We also felt we should have been the last to go on the bus since all 3 other planes had landed before us and waited much longer. There were 40 people still left and we were told that the last bus was coming but it could fit only 16 people. Ryanair informed the airport over the phone that they would reimburse taxi fares for the remaining people.

Dortmund to Katowice and vice versa. As all cheap airlines, Ryanair has strict measurements for the size of the luggage you're allowed to bring. While boarding the machine on the first flight, Dortmund to Katowice, our Luggage was measured by the ground and fit into the Ryanair restrictions. While boarding the flight back the very same luggage somehow did not fit into size regulations, and we were charged an additional 310 PLN (about 71,82€ at current rates) per piece of luggage. All that while other passengers that went by with visibly larger luggage were not asked to measure and could proceed to board unbothered by the ground staff. In addition, as we boarded the machine, the staff informed us that our Luggage would be too large to store it in the cabin, and had to be transported inside the cargo department of the plane. Which of course comes with extra waiting times at the airport. In addition, we booked a rental car at Katowice Airport over Ryanair. Of course, there where some problems with the booking and we had to cancel the booking and ended up paying about 70% more for the car as we initially would have.",negative,-0.599197,0,39,9.506288,7.559038

The trouble began when a passenger in front of us was forced to pay for their bag, even though it appeared perfectly fine from our viewpoint. We voiced our concerns, hoping for some empathy from the crew member. Unfortunately, this only seemed to provoke them to target us next. On a hot day in Lisbon, we had placed our jackets in a foldable bag, adhering to the baggage policy. However, as we were being briefed on the rules, we put our jackets on. After a discussion with a colleague, the crew member allowed us to proceed. While in the queue, one of my daughters, who has asthma, removed her jacket and hat. Suddenly, the same crew member appeared, ordering us out of the line and threatening to deny us boarding. Despite explaining that nothing had changed since they had previously allowed us through, they remained stubborn. They called another crew member over, and both of them joined in a verbal assault. They disregarded the fact that the extra bags were gadgets belonging to my child and wife, insisting that we could only carry four bags. Their behavior was not only rude and disrespectful but also unprofessional, displaying personal animosity and complete disregard for our well-being. It was evident that this crew member was actively seeking an excuse to single us out and personally target us. Our attempts to explain were met with increasing firmness, dismissiveness, and even mockery.

Despite it not being mandatory to complete web check-in for my flight, I was unjustly charged a hefty fee of 40EUR due to an error on their part. Upon arriving at the airport, I was informed that I needed to pay the additional fee because I had not completed the web check-in process. However, according to Ryanair's own policy, web check-in is not mandatory, and passengers are still able to check in at the airport without incurring any charges. I found it incredibly unfair and frustrating that I was penalized for their own mistake. The customer service representative I approached for assistance was unhelpful and unsympathetic to my situation. They showed no willingness to resolve the issue or provide any explanation for the unnecessary charge. This lack of professionalism only added to my dissatisfaction. As a frequent flyer, I have had positive experiences with several other airlines that prioritize customer satisfaction and go above and beyond to rectify their mistakes. Unfortunately, Ryanair fell far short of these expectations. The incident left a sour taste in my mouth and has significantly impacted my perception of Ryanair as a reliable and customer-centric airline. The lack of transparency and the unwarranted charge have made me question their commitment to customer service and fairness. I strongly advise other travelers to be cautious when booking with Ryanair and to carefully review their policies and fees.

(In addition to that, there were no queues at security control as well at both HHN and VNO - but it's out of airline's responsibility). The cabin crew were polite and helpful, but not annoying - also an excellent job done. And - last but not least - of course, very reasonable fares.

? Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Stansted to Venice,23-Mar,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  I had thought Ryanair would have improved over the years, but I was completely wrong. The cheap flights are completely offset by added charges. Firstly with bags, the size they provide as acceptable cabin bags are miniscule - barely enough to fit a days worth of clothes and items - so we purchased a cabin bag. The cabin bag they allow is the size of a usual carry on; the small wheeled suitcases so many people use. However when we got to check in, everyone with us (after the priority boarding) had these suitcases with no problem? We paid to have a bag checked in, when everyone else carried theirs on with no problem. That was ?55 extra. We then had to pay to sit next to each other, as I was travelling with my partner. We paid for this on one flight, and for the return flight we checked in as soon as online check in was open. Even though there were only a couple of seats already booked and the entire plane was empty, it deliberately seated us far apart in order to make us pay more. When it says they cannot guarantee you will be seated next to each other, take it to mean they will deliberately seat you far apart in order to get more money from you. Finally on the flight, having a flight attendant scream right next to you, as they yell at their colleague at the other end of the plane was interesting. Even more so was the aggressive way they do anything. I walk using a walking aid, and I called up to check this was ok before I boarded. After being told it was ok and that I would be able to keep the walking aid between my legs, an attendant roughly grabbed it on the flight and shoved it into an already full overhead locker, and then slammed it shut several times until it closed. This cracked and damaged the walking aid and I've now had to purchase another. When I submitted a complaint about this, I was told I needed to have filled in a particular form at the airport. I have never had an attendant damage the items I use to walk around before, and at no point does it say that if anything is damaged you need to fill in a form at the airport. I was then stuck in a loop of calling in to discuss this issue, being told to reply to an email and then being told they would do nothing as this form was not filled in. Ryanair remains a predatory airline - you will not pay the low amount you see online. Avoid them, and give your money to any of the other budget airlines if you're looking to save money.

The check-in staff at Fuerteventura airport were very professional and friendly too. Boarding was something of a mishap as there was no reinforcement of the priority boarding. This caused an upheaval as several passengers, rightly voiced their grievances over this. This was a very full flight including several family groups. The cabin crew were far more professional than on my outbound flight and imposed a strict no nuts regime as a passenger had a nut allergy. One crew member stood out from her peers, who was not only very professional but seemed to go the extra mile to assist an elderly couple and to help a lady who was unwell. This crew member is a great credit to Ryanair and deserves recognition for her professionalism and common sense. During the flight 2 to-buys drinks and snacks rounds were performed and again the crew did very well indeed. Although there was a delay of circa 50 minutes to departure this was communicated very well to the passengers. Disembarkation was quite something as a problem passengers stood up before landing and ignored instructions to sit down. This passenger rudely pushed his away along the aisle and brushed a cabin crew member aside. Astonishingly poor behaviour. The cabin crew should not have to deal with such appalling behaviour.

Follow the rules and one should be just fine within the remit of budget travel! I checked-in online without any issues and when I arrived at the airport, the priority boarding was largely enforced. The flight had a slight delay but communication was reasonable. Another let down was the poor attitude of two staff members. One lady seemed to do all the work while her colleagues took a back-seat attitude. I had a negative experience when I needed to use the lavatory. I politely asked a male member of the cabin crew if the lavatory was free? I am visually impaired. To my shock the staff member in question sighed and mumbled something in another language without answering my question. Disembarkation was a farce as the abusive woman and her brood pushed to the exit without any of the cabin crew correcting the dangerous behaviour eg standing up and removing bags from the locker before the flight had even properly landed. This was quite distressing for many passengers and a clear danger.

In the meanwhile, we contact our hotel to alert them to the uncertainty of the situation; they unfortunately warn us that it will not be possible to check in in the middle of the night (it was midnight by then). We arrive at Milan Linate and manage to catch the last shuttle to downtown Milan, where we squeeze into the first hotel next to the Central Station, in order to make as little distance as possible at midnight with baggage and personal belongings. Bewildered but exhausted and thus resigned, we pay three times the price of the hotel originally booked, which did not allow us to have a refund because of the short notice. Finally, once back home we decide to pursue a refund request (end of July 2022), promptly rejected because EU261 regulations do not provide for refunds due to ""unforeseeable"" conditions. We call support again, who suggests we ask for compensation instead of a refund (August 2022). In September 2022 I submit the request, in October 2022 I receive no response (waiting time described by the site for processing the request: 10 days), and decide to call the client support again. The operators, as always rude and annoyed, say they will send a reminder. I have no words for the incompetence of this company, their treatment of passengers (leaving them without water, food, explanations) is absolutely inhumane.",negative,-0.627484,1,38,9.284984,7.181592
? Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lisbon to Edinburgh,22-Oct,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  It all started what now seems a lifetime ago when sitting enjoying the sites of Lisbon City centre when my partner checked the Ryanair app out of mere curiosity to find our flight was delayed by over 3 hours. Inconvenient yes, but perhaps we could enjoy a few extra hours before heading to the airport? A quick chat with customer services should easily tell us if that's OK or whether we must be there for the original departure time.  After 20 minutes of fighting the customer service chat feature we gave up. A completely automated response to all questions, none of which related to the query at hand. Fast forward to the airport - the main terminal looks nice but we get shuttled off to the budget terminal.  Past security, not fun but not the fault of Ryanair at least. The delay is over 4 hours now so a quick search online shows we are entitled to food and drink. Best find a member of their helpful crew who will be happy to help! A walk of all the gates though provides slim pickings .. perhaps they don't want to help the people from the growing list of flights being delayed? When we did track down a member of staff at a gate, we were  ushered through a gate to a Ryanair desk that could help, only to find on going through the door that it was a one way trip - back to the initial check-in slaughterhouse. I feel by this point we all know what the response was at the check-in desk - go and ask at the gate of course. We tried to argue briefly. We took the tickets, we accept our fate. At least the comforting knowledge we received from the checkin desk that someone will come out and offer help from Ryanair back at the gate will keep us warm over the upcoming hours of woe. Back at the gate now. Security was even better the second time around, apparently they don't like boarding passes being used twice. When we mentioned Ryanair though they seemed to get it. Not sure how many hours to go. Perhaps a member of Ryanair will come and offer assistance at some point. Perhaps even food. Or water.

Firstly, the website is logical and well set out stating the rules and policies of the airline. Follow the rules and there are no problems. I should like to commend the Check-in staff for their help and efficiency. I took a train from London to the Stansted airport unfortunately the luggage of another passenger ripped the top of my bag. The check-in staff noticed this rip and were very helpful towards me. Boarding the flight was another matter as there was a rather large group of Italian teenagers returning home to Italy. Their chaperones were badly organised and the Ryanair ground staff did not manage this well resulting in a delay to the flight of about forty minutes. None of the ground staff showed any initiative in this situation. None of the ground staff spoke any Italian and there was no effort to translate to the teenagers.  Passengers were allowed to queue in the bridge before the flight was ready to depart. There were steep stairs to be negotiated and I assisted an elderly passenger with the stairs as no warning had been given about the stairs. The security demonstration was reasonably well conducted. Service was lacklustre with one cabin crew yawning over her passengers and rolling her eyes and looked bored. The lovely lady who sat next to me ordered a prosecco and was gruffly handed her drink and a cracked plastic glass. The drink spilled over the lady and the male cabin crew showed no interest and seemed to expect the passenger to continue drinking from the cracked plastic glass. The male staff member had to be asked to find some paper towels and to replace the glass. He sighed indignantly when asked to do so. At one stage a member of the cabin crew locked the lavatory and caused a line to form. There was no apology or explanation either. The landing was fine but disembarkation was chaotic and poorly managed. Based on this experience, I would think twice about booking with this airline again. The ground staff were superb, friendly and polite and very helpful. Their professionalism was let down by the cabin crew.",negative,-0.578271,1,38,9.284984,7.181592

I booked an around trip and on my departure to Corfu and my bags went through the system smoothly and without any concern, but then on my flight back home, with the same exact priority that I had on my first departure they tell me that my bag is too big and I have to pay extra for it. The girl at the check-in did not say anything about me having to pay even extra at the gate, and I was not the only one that went through this process. Not only did I have to pay extra, the Ryanair personnel at the gate were very rude and gave me and others attitude. And to top it off, the flight was just as expected by me, late.

There isn't much room for a person who is overweight in 1 of Ryanair seats, they'll probably be uncomfortable for the whole flight, especially next to the window. Ryanair use Terminal 3. It's a no smoking terminal. Ryanair quote, ""low fares"", but they mean the starting price is a low fare. It soon adds up to cost just as much as easyjet or jet2. When you board or come off a Ryanair flight you'll find it's always up/down the steps not through the airbridge. When you're waiting for your suitcase. Expect to be waiting for at least 1 hour and 30 mins. Otherwise you might loose your mind and take it out on the wrong member of staff....like me. On our way home from Rome we arrived at the airport, got through security. I decided to check my phone to see where the plane was using Plane Finder. The answer to my question....Manchester. It had literally just taken off. We left nearly an hour late. During the flight we were told no food or drink available. Imagine if we purchased an inflight meal. We arrived at Manchester but spent 3 hours waiting for our bags because Swissport must've only had 3 people unloading each Ryanair flight. So we were 1 of 3 flights landed. For 3 planes there is a maximum of 3 baggage handlers. I know this because the baggage handler told me. I decided to ask him what abuse he was getting from a passenger who landed with me that day.

If you do not wish to pay an extra fee for check-in, you need to do it online 24 hours before the flight. However if you try to do it 2 hours before the flight, it is already closed and you need to check in at the airport and pay an extra fee of 55 Euros per person at the counter. Forcing customers to pay extra fees that are higher than the actual ticket! For a service that takes their employee 2 minutes. That's down right scammy in my opinion. We didn't even get seats next to each other even though we paid that fee.

She might well be right that this is a better option but in our situation that is totally beyond the point. No actions taken, nothing done, just a shrug. We managed just about to arrive gate on last and final call just to be stuck in an unventilated corridor with all the other passengers for 25 minutes before boarding started.

She and her colleague seemed to feel proud of the way she had put us on display embarrassing us in front of everyone else who had now lined up behind us.

Eventually, my nephew got his passport and his boarding pass back and they started embarking. They asked us to wait even though I had paid for fast track and we were already at the front of the queue. They deliberately kept us there and let us board after I became upset. When we boarded we were confronted by the flight attendant who told us that the cabin bag we had just paid for needed to be in the cargo bay even though it's smaller than normal cabin cases. I advised them we had paid and pointed at the tag which was snow taped to the bag and she insisted that we should have been told to put in cargo. I tried to explain that they didn't tell us and we wouldn't know that as we don't work for the airline. She put her hands up in my face cutting me off and stating that its the airport and not the airline and she doesn't work for the airport. I advised that we don't work for the airport either. She agreed for us to have our case in the overhead compartment but stated that should it fill up, it would need to go in the cargo area. We watched as cases bigger and heavier than my nephews were placed in the overhead compartment with no argument. I have never been so embarrassed as I have with Ryanair and will never fly using Ryanair ever again. I will tell anyone who will listen to what happened and never fly Ryanair again.

Once we boarded the plane however, there was than a 1 hr 45 min delay to our flight where we sat on the tarmac and waited.

Within 20 minutes we were upstairs again with our results, but the two employees had closed the check in counter, after they had told us to run downstairs to get a test and then come back for our boarding passes. We couldn¡¯t get our passes online because it directed us to the ticket counter, but the ticket counter had stranded us.

Beware of the latest scam - 3rd party services booked on the Ryanair website: I was flying from London to Malaga and, when I purchased extra hold luggage the day before I flew, I decided to, at the same time, also buy a ticket for National Express from Victoria coach station to Stansted airport. I did so and paid one amount on my credit card, but I received no confirmation of the National Express booking, so I called NE and they had no record of my booking or payment. I did so again the next morning - still no record, so I had to buy the ticket again at a higher price. I tried to call Ryanair, but could not get through to them, nor had any success with their ""live"" chat. After arriving in Malaga I tried to get a refund from Ryanair, whom I had paid, but they said that I needed to get this from NE and that it had nothing to do with them as NE were a third party service provider. All my explanations that I had paid Ryanair and NOT NE were ignored. So I called NE again and they still said that they had no record of the reservation or payment, so I had to make a claim against my credit card company for a refund. All this took several hours of my time and was incredibly stressful. It was a relatively small amount, but I was incensed by Ryanair's approach and determined to get my money back. They are truly shocking in their customer service.  Only fly with them if there is NO alternative, even if other airlines are more expensive. Only buy the most basic/cheapest ticket and only upgrade or buy extras (seat choice, hold luggage, food, etc) as late as possible and just before your flight - in case there is a change of plan or cancellation, then your refund amount is much lower. Never purchase 3rd party services from their website - car rental, coach travel, hotels, etc. If there is a problem then they will screw you.

I¡¯ve had my shares of bad experience with Ryanair but always thought ¡°Well, my bad I should have been more prepared I guess¡± or ¡°they are probably having a bad day, cut them some slack¡± etc. But if you¡¯re going to be aggressive and verbally abusive to two senior travelers, then we¡¯re going to have a real problem. Even more if the seniors in question are my parents who have a limited knowledge of English. My parents came to visit us this weekend. They arrived in London fully prepared, vaccinated, passports, forms, VeriFly app literally everything that was required and asked of them. They flew in with BA at Heathrow and everything went smoothly (take some notes Stansted!). Then we prepared their return journey and they made sure to book 2 handbags (that¡¯s how it works now you have to pay for handbags too). So, prior to the trip they booked two ¡®less than 10 kg handbags¡¯ on the agency¡¯s website which gave them also the right to priority board (something they were not aware of). They actually waited and queued until it was time to board and once in front of the person at the desk were asked to pay ?90 for the two bags. My dad tried to explain he already paid for it, but she didn¡¯t want to hear it, she laughed to their faces because they tried to explain themselves with the few English words they know, and then she realized that my dad speaks Spanish (apparently, she did too) so they managed to understand each other to some extent. She lost patience and told my parents it was either they paid for the bags, or they had to leave them behind. Scared and tired by the situation they decided to pay and after they got the confirmation and the sticky tag on their bags asked if they could get an invoice or receipt. The lady said she didn¡¯t have it and that they will receive it by email. However never confirmed it with my dad and asked them to quickly move towards the plane and embark. Then someone - I'm guessing who's a security person - yelled at them in the corridor in English (remember a language they don't understand) and kept screaming and shouting at them for a good minute without thinking they might not be able to understand his language. Literally no patience, no kindness, no respect. My parents managed to connect the dots and gathered that he wanted them to leave the bags outside the plane (remember small handbags less than 10 kg) they pointed a corner to him, and he let out some kind of agreeing grunt. Then once on board they probably were thinking they could finally relax, but no, once again someone with a lot of empathy and sympathy decided otherwise. The hostess that day kept asking my mum to remove her jacket, and put it up in the overhead bin, then underneath the seat, then finally take it back and put it on her knees because it wasn¡¯t right, and every 5 minutes came back to check if she was ""cooperating"" because she also asked my mum to remove her scarf and for some reason it needed to be left with the jacket. What is wrong in your head? When a lady of a certain age is cold, you pressure her into removing her clothes? First, I don¡¯t get what the security hazard is with a scarf. Second, it¡¯s literally freezing outside, and we know how cold it can be inside the plane before take-off, also ever heard of covid. I mean come on.

The feeling of being a victim of an air company¡¯s fraudulent manipulations is awful, it¡¯s like when someone steals your wallet.

? Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Crete (Chania) to Athens,21-Sep,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," Our flight from Crete to Athens started off with online check-in issues. We followed the prompts, but there was no option for check in, only to cancel or change flight. We even watched a video but never was presented with a check in option on the mobile website. When we arrived at the airport, we spoke to one of the employees at the bag check line, and explained to her our issue with online check in. She offered no help or advice, only said there is nothing for her to do and that we must pay €55 each to print our tickets or we could speak to her coworker at a Skyserv help desk. We proceeded to the alternate employee at the Skyserv booth and once again explained our troubles with online check in. We even showed her the step by step process in which we tried to check in on our mobile phone. She started to raise her voice and said ¡°I don¡¯t know why you¡¯re the only people having an issue. Other customers don¡¯t have this issue. It¡¯s clearly something you did wrong!¡± Instead of providing us with actual help and presenting a fix to the issue that we physically showed her on the phone, she was dismissive, blaming us, and outright rude. When we wished to escalate the matter, she refused to tell us her name and began acting even more erratic. She stated that ¡°Ryanair will know who I am and I don¡¯t have to give you any information.¡± At this point we were forced into making one of two decisions - miss our flight or pay €55 for each boarding pass. Extremely unsatisfied with the lack of help, we returned to the bag check desk, and decided to go ahead with the payment. At our second interaction with the bag check staff, we were informed that the price per boarding pass is now €62.50! We showed them the Ryanair email that said it was €55 and explained to said staff that she told us ten minutes prior that it was a €55 fee. The employee told us to look at her screen if we have an issue, because that¡¯s what it says and she could give no explanation for the discrepancy in Ryanair email or what we were previously told. At this point we were uncomfortably coerced into choosing to either miss our flight or pay this new arbitrary price that no employee could give an explanation for. No one can explain to us why we were unable to check in online and no one can explain to us why there was an increase in price after this entire debacle. Fast forward two months after this incident and multiple complaints to Ryanair, they finally responded with again no resolution. A representative from Ryanair emailed stating, ""At first, I would like to express our sympathy regarding the circumstances resulting in you being unable to have done the check-in online. However, if a customer does not manage to check-in online then an airport check-in fee of €55/?55 per person is applied."" This acknowledges our inability to check-in, but somehow still place the blame on the customer. When questioned about why we were arbitrary told to pay €62.50 by the bag check staff when Ryanair and this representative's email clearly stated €55, another rep responded back with, ""Unfortunately, as per the previous responses you have received, our standpoint remains unaltered that means according to our agreed Terms and Conditions Article 10.1 all monies paid towards Ryanair are non-refundable."" So again no explanation. It really feels like a ""you have to pay whatever amount we tell you or you get to miss your flight"" situation.

And that¡¯s the only positive thing I¡¯m going to say about Ryanair. The aircraft was a new looking 737-800. On my flight out to bud from stn I was lucky enough to have an entire row of seats to myself, despite the rest of the aircraft being near capacity. Any airline I¡¯ve flown with, in hot weather, will have the cabin a/c active for boarding. Not Ryanair. We sat in 30 degree heat for about 30 minutes with not so much as a breeze.  That didn¡¯t really matter though, because the overhead fans were just awful. On this aircraft were recessed into the facia, so the direction couldn¡¯t be altered. Add to that the ¡°breeze¡± wouldn¡¯t have been sufficient to blow out an already fading candle on a child¡¯s birthday cake. I had two fans pointing vaguely in my direction, both set to full, both failing to live up to their job descriptions. The seats were they bad, narrow and with about 2mm of padding.  Now for the speedy boarding scam, I was standing in the terminal in BUD with the rest of the non speedy folk while the last of the speedy boarders had cleared the gate a good ten minutes previously. I was a little miffed up until I saw the speedy boarders all standing in a ¡°cage¡± section of the air bridge (pictured) completely in air conditioned and completely open to the more than 30 degree heat. Contrast that with the regular folk who were enjoying the departure gate a/c. Both my flight to BUD and return flight to STN arrived late, yet Ryanair insisted upon playing their obnoxious fanfare.

Ryanair promises to change your flights free of charge or extend voucher, but one week before flight. I supposed to fly to Bologna from Prague, pre condition is to have a PCR test not older than 3 days. My husband got positive and obviously we had to go to quarantine. I reached out ryanair and only option available was actually to change flights, but for every option they were charging full price extra for luggage (it's 40 euro on top of 50 I have already paid for luggage) and therefore any option I was extra I have to pay to keep tickets was way higher than to buy completely new. So I've asked if there is a way to cancel and get at least something back even through voucher to use it for other flight, but 150 euro of one ticket thrown away. But in this particular case it's cheating on clients: we are doing here tests on weekly base and you cannot predict to get Covid before flight if you were fine week before and extra nearly full charge for luggage on top is really stealing money.

This happened about two weeks ago and I had to rearrange my travelling, throwing away a couple of tickets from the 8 flights I had already booked with Ryanair.

In addition, I bought a travel insurance for my flights, and after covid 19 cancellations, Ryannair informed me that they will refund the flight cost excluding the travel insurance cost. Their response was that because I could use the travel insurance for compensation. But then, when I asked if I can get compensation, they told me that according to the terms and conditions, I cannot get compensation for the cancellation.

This year alone they have told a party of 7 that they could either change there flight date or receive a full refund due to a Covid related issue, we selected the refund but did not receive anything, when we contacted them again they said that they could not give a refund but could change the flights, which we then agreed to, again we heard nothing further and the flights did not change, once again we contacted them and they said that they could not change the flights and we would have to wait for a refund, after several more conversations we ended up changing the flights. These flights were booked to attend a family wedding and the revised flights had us returning early morning the day after the flight, we have logged onto the app tonight to check all the details to find that the return flight has been changed and they have not made any attempt to inform us. The return flight are now 30 minutes before the wedding was due to begin. When we were told for the second time that we would have to apply for a refund we were also told that no refunds would be paid out until the corona virus pandemic had ended. On a separate flight for the honeymoon of said wedding we have spent literally 3 full days waiting to talk to a member of the team on the live chat only to be left sat in the queue all day on each occasion. We regularly travel between Manchester and Naples to visit family and this is the only airline which flys regular direct routes between the 2 airports or I can assure you, we would never fly with this company again. I cannot express in words what a poor excuse for a company they are and my dealings with them have left me feeling that there should be much more stringent rules and regulations governing how airlines operate, I can¡¯t think of any other business where you could change what you are selling to a customer and not be liable to pay them back in full immediately.

I haven't even heard from them since the initial email about canceling my flight. There is an update on their website about how they are doing with their cancellation backlog but it's clearly bogus. It hasn't been updated since it's creation and the things it states are untrue. In the beginning, Ryanair has been pushing vouchers on their customers who asked for refunds, and made it as hard as possible to contact them (it's still next to impossible). I guess this is exactly the case of getting what you pay for. Sure Ryanair is cheap but you have to deal with things like this. The seats are tiny.

The second flight I could not change for free, I could not make decision in less than 7 days prior to flying so I missed the ""free change option"" - did not fly.

Due to corona virus in Italy things got a bit crazy, Bologna airport was overcrowded and security lines very slow. It took me 1h and 40 minutes to go through the security and I am sure it could have been even longer if I didn't put pressure to hurry up. Anyway, Ryanair didn't warn that lines were longer than usual and didn't make any announcement telling that the boarding was opening or that the boarding was closing. The gate was closed 18/20 minutes before flight departure (it is stated in their rule that this can happen, but I never experienced that). My question is can it be that in a very difficult moment such as the one in which Italy is, Ryanair decides to be even more strict and careless for his customer? I really have no words to describe how disappointed I was and how disgusted my such poor behaviour of this flight company. On top of this the employees at the desk were very rude and aggressive.

I was supposed to check in my luggage since I had also a small backpack and Ryanair policies do not allow the carry on of two pieces of luggage on board (the check in of this second bag was included in the ticket that I bought). While I was waiting in line (there were 50 people before me) the check in for Eindhoven suddenly closed without any announcements and I was not able to check in my extra luggage. The Ryanair lady at the counter told me that there was nothing that could be done, she told me to try and go directly to the gate and ask to make an exception so that I can bring my luggage onboard since it was a hand luggage and the check in closed without any warnings or announcements. When I arrived to the gate, another Ryanair lady told me that exceptions can not be made since internal policies obligate you to check in extra pieces of hand luggage. I tried to told her what happened but I had to pay a fee of EUR 25,00 and was not able to take the baggage on board. I was forced to hand it in before entering the plane and that was the last time I saw it being placed into the airplane hold without any damage, being perfectly intact. When I arrived to Eindhoven my luggage was returned through the luggage belt, and it was completely torn apart. I went to the damaged luggage counter to ask how to proceed since Ryanair was responsible for destroying my luggage! The lady at the counter told me that I had to fill in a complaint and then go to the Ryanair website and ask for a refund. I did everything as needed, including going to the police bureau at the airport in Eindhoven. Ryanair told me that they could not do anything about what happened except refunding me with EUR 20,00. The reason why they could not do anything about it was that, since I could not hand in the receipt of my luggage - bought some years ago - they could not make sure how much the luggage was worth, why and how on earth should one keep the receipt of a luggage that was bought years before? Ryanair does not care about its customers, neither did they in the past, nor will they in the future!

When I complained to my boyfriend, a fight attendant told me, very rudely 'ma'am this is the walking cabin, it's normal for the crew to be walking up and down with carts'. Maybe in Ryanair this is normal, but certainly not in other companies. When I arrived to Portugal, it took more than an hour - 1 hour and 12 minutes to be precise - for the bags from this flight to start to arrive. Two other fights that arrived much later already had their bags delivered on our mat, while we were still waiting. When asking Ryanair employees about what was going on with our bags, they said they couldn't help us or give us any information, as they didn't know.

I¡¯d already checked the pricing of baggage for the airline (some budget flights ask you to pay for carry-on, but I had found Ryanair only charges €10-20 for check in baggage and nothing for small carry-on). The cost for each bag to go under the plane? €40 each. That¡¯s almost €200, just to get on the plane! That¡¯s more expensive than my flight was to start with! Absolutely no customer care, let alone a shred of politeness or empathy.

If you don't want something, don't pay for it. Simple enough. You can check in weeks before your flight, which means that you can print out both boarding passes at home.

? Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Madrid to London (Stansted),19-Dec,1,2,,,,1,1,no,1," Worst airline for countless reasons. 1) Flight delayed by six hours. We were scheduled to depart at 6.05pm. Everyone had boarded the aircraft by 6pm, but we were told by flight attendants to disembark due to a ""technical error on the plane"". The flight was rescheduled to 12 midnight, but it eventually only took off at around 1am the next day - a total of seven hours of delay. 2) Zero accountability. Ground staff were completely clueless as to any protocol in times of delay. Worse still, for the next ninety minutes or so there was no follow up action and all passengers were just stranded at the boarding gate. We were told to ""come check back every 30 min or so"" and there was no assurance of what would be done. 3) Shamelessly tried to shirk responsibility. We were told we could make claims via the EU261 flight regulation. However when I submitted my claim, the airline had the gall to say the flight was ""delayed due to air traffic controller restrictions, which was outside of our control"", which was totally opposite of the technical errors that the air crew had stated. 4) Poorest ever customer service. I followed up with Ryanair customer service staff who had zero professionalism. He was nonchalant throughout the correspondence. The incompetence of this staff member is highlighted in the fact he redirected me to the CAA UK site despite knowing my flight had departed from Spain, and that CAA does not serve cases where the flight departs from other EU member countries. Overall, I regret booking flights from a subpar company with service undeserving of any approval whatsoever. The rock-bottom standard is paralleled by its consistently plummeting stock price.

Paying 55 euro to do the most standard thing possible (which is just checking in) is completely ridiculous, at no point before flying was I told and many other people for that matter, that not checking in online will incur such an expensive fee. Everyone will end up paying the pilots directly upon entering the plane so they take off at his rate. The staff were extremely rude and unhelpful and also horribly robotic to deal with. You are left with the impression that you are cattle being herded onto a truck and that you¡¯re lucky it¡¯s so cheap.

When we landed in Athens from the US we tried to go the desk to check in for our flight to Santorini four days later. However, the airline said it was too early and we could do so later. When we arrived for our flight we were told because we missed our window to check in (48 hours to 2 hours before the flight - we were there 1 hour and 55 minutes before) we would have to pay 60 euros each. We explained that they woudn't let us check in previously and they said they had sent us an email. We were on vacation and had taken a break from media. The staff was not kind or thoughtful, they just handed us a bill for 120 euros and sent us to another desk to pay if we still wanted to make the flight we had already purchased. To say the least we were quite upset about paying double for our flights that we had booked several weeks prior. When we left Santorini we had similar problems. The desk agent asked us for printed boarding passes. When we told her we didn't have access to a printer at our Air BnB she said it would be 30 euros per person to get a boarding pass. We could not believe that we were asked once again to pay more money on top of our ticket prices just to print out a boarding pass. She was unfriendly and handed us a ticket to go pay our bill. We asked if there was some other way around this and she said that if we wanted to step out of line and download the app. that was an option. So, even though we had been in the line since early that morning we stepped out of the line and downloaded the app. even though we really did not want this app on our cell phone. What a run around. To say the least, we will not be flying this airline again. It was such a disappointment. At least if they had been friendly that would have helped.",negative,-0.668375,0,35,9.047233,6.476972

As a budget airline, the flight was adequate, it felt safe, wasn¡¯t particularly comfortable and pretty much delivered as expected... if not a little better. The seat was wider than expected, and staff were more helpful than I¡¯d have thought. I wasn¡¯t fond of the lack of a seat pocket, but it it did give me extra leg room so points to them for that. Seats are non-reclining because of course they would be and While the safety card being printed on the seatback is a clever idea to save weight and all, it¡¯d be nice if they calmed down a little with all the yellow.

The flight time is late in the evening, the arrival in Dublin (depending on the season) is scheduled generally after 11 pm. The flight is constantly delayed, I think only 2 or 3 times the flight left at the right time according to my experience. This has often caused me serious problems as my final destination in Ireland is not Dublin but Galway, and the last bus I can catch is at 00.30. This means that several times I had to sleep at the airport and wait for the next bus (around 5.30 am). Many times I asked the flight crew if any options were available such as hotel accommodation (at least at a special price) or alternative transportation. Last time (a month ago) they offered a 4 euros snack coupon for a 2 and half hours delay, I did not know whether to laugh at their faces or cry!

This would give us almost three full days in Rome. A matter of weeks after I bought the trip, Ryanair changed the flight time to more than 4 hours later meaning that we did not get to Rome until late afternoon. By the time we got the bus into Rome and checked into our hotel, almost the entire day was gone meaning we only had two days in Rome.

I rang Ryan Air a full 14 days before my outbound flight to let them know that I would not be able to travel after all due to family/personal reasons. As I had paid for their optional 'one trip travel insurance' I told them that I would be claiming my flight costs back via the insurance policy. To cut a long story short: I was told that Ryanair has no cancellation policy and that I would have to wait for at least 24 hours after my return journey and then phone Ryanair again to request a 'Did Not Show' confirmation letter. This will form step one in the insurance claim process. As my return flight was booked for 10th November I, therefore, phoned Ryanair 12th November. They told me they will email me the necessary 'Did Not Show' letter and that I can expect this in the next 8 working days. I said that this was a ridiculously long time to wait, particularly when the customer service agent said she could see that I hadn't used the ticket and would, therefore, be instructing the DNS letter to be processed immediately. When I asked what the procedure was once I had received the DNS letter she said she did not know but was sure that instructions would be included in the email. My issues are: I informed Ryanair 24th October that I would not be using my ticket but was told that I could not start to claim back my flight costs until at least 2 days after my return flight. This meant there would be an empty seat travelling to Vilnius 7th November and an empty seat travelling back to Luton on 10th November. As Ryanair confirmed there was no way of cancelling my ticket/seat then I must assume those seats were left empty! That sounds like very bad commercial practice - not something I would expect of a low cost/budget airline. Ryanair offers 'one trip travel insurance' at the time of booking and then cannot explain the procedure for making a claim against the insurance policy. They blame it on the fact that their insurers are a 'third party'! Check! The transaction was made between me and Ryanair and I expect Ryanair to be responsible. I now have to wait possibly another 10 days simply to start the claiming process - a process which I am still in the dark about. How much longer will this take?

The fares were very cheap. I purchased priority boarding, so had 2 cabin bags allowance. Website experience was good, the mobile application worked fine, and apple pay functionality was a big convenience. The only strange thing about website vs application experience is that when purchasing priority boarding you can not buy 10 kg checked bag allowance on the website. On mobile you can do this. Another thing to watch is cost of this service. It changes, and the price can double, so if you need it, it is better to buy it early. At the airport check-in desk was not overcrowded. Boarding was fast and efficient, with usual nasty waiting when priority line had to be formed on the stairs and then lined up near the plane. But flying low cost you have to accept this. Onboard everything was ok. Seats are passably comfortable. I purchased hot meal and it was tasty. Toilet condition was good. Departures and arrivals both times on schedule. I was able to read all the bad reviews, but as I can see most of them are written by the people who didn't follow rules and been fined for that. For me the main difference between legacy carriers and low cost is that legacy bring you to your destination whatever happens (they put you on different flight or on competition company or re-route you). Low cost carriers just say sorry and do refund. This is where the real difference is. All the rest become more and more identical.",positive,0.303045,0,35,9.047233,6.476972

It is my first and last time flying with them! I strongly, strongly advise you to never ever fly with them on principle alone! Their baggage rules and deadlines are ridiculous. As a whole I paid an extra $162 Euros for a flight that was only supposed to be $94 Euros. In Canadian, that is almost $300 extra dollars so naturally I'm upset. The worst thing about this company is the complete lack of customer service. The carry-on I took to Madrid is built in the dimensions to fit all cabin flights. The exact same carry-on I took from Madrid to Porto was all of a sudden too big to return to Madrid. I tried to explain this to the staff member and the first thing she says to me is, ""I'm just doing my job, it's not my fault they weren't doing their job over there."" Note that this is the exact same company and the inconsistency is frustrating. She asked me to come with her and check the size and in my opinion it fit and she disagreed. I asked to talk to the supervisor who approached me with hostility and attitude. She called me ""baby"" and when I kindly asked her not to call me that she called me it three more times before I refused to speak to her. I went to another Ryanair desk and asked another staff member who must have been instructed by her supervisor to treat me poorly because I simply asked her, ""Where is your customer service desk please?"" All of her body language including rolling her eyes was rude and I asked her why she was giving me attitude when I asked a reasonable question. All she told me was ""third floor"" and when I asked for more specific details she was reluctant and rude the whole time. I followed her instructions just to be told by security that the Ryanair customer service was outside which this staff member did not mention. Not wanting to miss my flight, I opted to pay whatever fee they needed and was met with minimum information, being rushed and two people talking to me at once. Once said I had to pay 25 Euros and the other said I had to pay 50 Euros which I ended up paying with no print out receipt which I had received on the Madrid side. This company can not assume that everyone knows exactly how everything works and they need to learn to treat people reasonably if they are incapable of kindness. On my first experience with Ryanair I interacted with a total of 8 very poor employees the worst of which was the supervisor from Porto who called me ""baby"" after kindly being asked several times not to do that.

The next person I spoke to was also rude, I asked about my options and was only given 100Euro exchange of flight option. I asked to speak to a supervisor who essentially threw a pre-written customer service paper at me. I explained that I would just like help and would prefer to do it at the airport. He walked away and I had to follow him and ask again for a number. He again was short and pointed in a direction just saying ""there"". At this point I was very upset because customer service usually responds with sympathy and kindness even if nothing can be done. I waited in line and the initial female I spoke to was avoiding me. I had to insist on receiving a number from the other male rep who reluctantly gave me an incorrect number and did nothing further to help me after I showed him it didn't work. I had to search up a correct number online and at least the rep on the phone was more reasonable, but I will never ever fly Ryanair again. The cheaper fees are made up in baggage fees. You are  locked in once you make a purchase which was terrible because I would have rather paid 200 Euros extra to completely change to an airline that actually cares about their customers. Furthermore, I missed this flight due to confusion on Ryanair airs website and the language barrier. They should provide better instructions to the ridiculous setup at the airport, make it easier to find or provide a general direct address if possible!

We got to the airport two hours before the flight. There was only one person at the counter doing the check in for the whole plane. We waited 1 hour and 20¡¯ to be exact until we got to the counter. The person at the counter tells us we don¡¯t have the boarding passes printed. We had our reservation print out but not our boarding passes, I had tried to do the check in the day before with no luck. Since I was traveling with scattered internet and no printer available, we assumed we would be able to check in at the airport but no. We were sent to another counter at the airport with a Ryanair supervisor who started to mistreat myself and my family. She said we had to paid €220 as a penalty for not having our boarding passes. Of course we were not happy about this but we handed out our credit card and asked her name or employee identification number so we can later make a complaint about her mistreat to the company. She did not like that. She refused to give that information as well as taking our Credit card saying ""Why should I give you my name, I don't have to"". After these unfortunate exchange with her. I grabbed my phone to see if I could find any way to get the boarding passes online. She accused me of taking a picture of her, which did not occur. I offered her to check my phone and confirm that I wasn¡¯t filming or taking pictures (the airport police confirmed what I was saying was the truth later) and she refused to do that as well. Her assumption was wrong and decided to punish us denying to let us board on this plane or any future Ryanair flight. We asked for help, to see if we could talk to anyone else (any reasonable person), she refused to help or to refer us to any other place that we can address our concern, she wouldn¡¯t talk to us. We asked for any airport authority or for the police to help us out to no avail or response from anyone. In our desperation for help since we were missing our flight my husband had to yell in the middle of the airport calling the police for help to be able to get some attention but no one came. Finally we went to a different company counter and asked them to please call the police for us, the finally called them. Not only we were humiliated by this person who showed abused of her authority but we had to buy new tickets for €1000 and got stuck at the airport for 9 hours for a total arbitrary decision of someone who couldn¡¯t prove any bad behavior on our end.  The airport police finally came, we talked to them for a while, we were quite altered by the situation by then they said they could not give us any information of this person and had no authority on the flight since it was owned by a private company so they could not help us.

Well, the low price of this flight naturally attracts you when you are booking your ticket, but if you know for different unreasonable reasons that you might have never heard before in your life they will charge you over 1000 euros and does not let you get into your flight, you might change your mind. With my family, we were traveling from Berlin to Madrid, and since we had check-in luggage, I decided to not do online check-in. We were among the first people that went to the check-in desk and there, they told us that we should have done online check-in 3 minutes ago at the latest and now we have to pay 55 euros per person for them to do the check-in. So we paid this money, and again we were among the first people who were at the gate to go to the airplane. When they were checking our boarding pass, they said that there was a problem with one of our check-in luggage and we can not get into the plane! (Later they never informed us what was the problem.) When I tried to convince them that they have to wait for us to solve the problem, their crew rudely shouted at me! They told us to go to the Ryanair desk at the airport (SXF) and there they told us that this is not their responsibility and there is no one there to help us, and all we can do is writing a complaint letter! The only option they gave us, and they believed that we have to be thankful about that, was paying 100 euros per person and get new tickets for the day after, and since I was with my family and had no other reasonable choices, I had to pay more money and book the ticket.  After all, they destroyed our vacation, and we had a lot more additional costs for the hotel and all other expenses to spend the night in Berlin.

Where my wife was sat there was dried blood around the seat. She also needed to use the bathroom, which was filthy and covered in urine. When she enquired as to a better option, the attendant locked the door of the dirty toilet and simply opened a previously locked bathroom. What was the point of having that option locked to customers for Ryanair¡¯s convenience rather than the customers? Delays with our bags at the other end too.

Booking System of Ryanair: it is as shitty as you expect it to be from a low cost airline. The prices seem to appear low at first sight but in the end you end up with ruffly the same amount as with other airlines. They try to sell you so much shit you don't need. Like it was worth being in boarding group 1, going through a ""fast lane Check in""... In the end you just wait as long as everyone else because it doesn't make the whole boarding faster, but Ryanair sends you Emails saying ""better buy it, don't lose time at the airport, board hands free,..."" putting you under pressure to buy all the extras. Why would you need to book extra ""sitting together""? Despite the fact that you are able to spend 2 hours in a plane without sitting together and if needed kindly ask one of the other passengers to change seats. Ryanair's seat booking system could easily make you sit next to each other but it doesn't do it on purpose so you spend again extra 7€ or more just to sit to your beloved. All buttons on Ryanair's website which say something like ""add to card"" are highlighted but the ones which say ""skip"" are not just to make you feel you need to buy stuff. 2. The actual flight: In the airplane the whole tables are screwed to the seat so customers can't eat from them and the seats got no bags for your laptop etc. so Ryanair ""saves time"" during the cleanup for the next flight. Of course they always have some ""special offers"" in the air and they disturb you several times wanting you to buy parfum¨¦ or other stuff that you ""need right now"". 3. And what's about the luggage thing?! It always was a wired thing in every airline but Ryanair took it to another level. As it would matter if 2 kg too much on the luggage are taken out and put in your hand luggage, it's still on the same airplane?! Ryanair changed the policy of luggage in November 2018. So a normal hand luggage (55x40x20) that counts for every other airline is considered to be normal luggage for Ryanair now. And of course everyone who takes his old loved hand luggage now to the boarding gate is stopped by Ryanair and charged 25€ extra. So by bearing everything written in here in mind I cannot book any flights with Ryanair anymore and I don't recommend it to everyone else who are thinking about it.

They also charge for every call to their customer service center (yes, it¡¯s true) so I racked up quite a bill just trying to get ahold of someone. The customer service phone reps all told me different things: one person said I would have to contact the airport and ask them how I would get a reference number since I didn't do it when I arrived, another told me it could only have been done at the time of arrival, and another person just told me to fill out a contact form online with pictures attached. Calling the phone numbers I was given were either disconnected numbers or just a loop of automated voice options which lead you back to the original menu options or tell you where to look online.

I explained we were unable to due to problems on the ryanair app, two members of staff told us that they were aware of the problems but we needed to pay - members of staff were very unhelpful, very rude and very unprofessional, one even refusing to look at us at any point and both refusing to get a manager. We had to pay the money as we needed to get back, but I am disgusted with the customer service and the price of printing two boarding passes, how they can justify ?110 to print two pieces of paper I will never know. Finally when I got back I emailed in a complaint there response ignored all the points and information I provided and just said no refund.

Its not my fault its just the way they operate"". To make matters worse, we paid online to be seated together and when printing out our boarding passes for a fee of 110 euros in total, we were told by the check in woman that the computer has automatically generated us different seats and there is nothing she can do.

Long story short they charged my €55 to check in. I now know their charges on late check in but there was absolutely no empathy for my issue. No flexibility and couldn¡¯t care less. It was about getting money from me. I had another occasion to contact their customer service team to get back an iPad that I left on their plane. Again absolutely useless in either their knowledge of how to help me and they didn¡¯t care. Luckily I was able to get the iPad back due to the find my phone app. I will fly with them only (and only) because they are cheap. So I will use them the way they use their customers. I predict the unions will create a situation where Ryanair will end up having to charge the same as much better and reputable airlines like Aer Lingus (an absolute pleasure to fly with) and then Ryanair will not last.

We are family of four travel back from Istanbul, unfortunately, the last leg was Ryanair from CPH. This review may be useful for other readers not to get caught by Ryan Air at the gate where they completely rip you off. Firstly when they allocate the seats while we were on holiday they put the family members in completely different locations so to get seats allocated to sit together you need to pay ?8 per seat. My 12-year-old daughter when her birthday still in December they say she is 13 and need to sit on her own. We got the boarding pass while we were on holiday by kiwi.com and boarding pass says, if you need to carry 2 cabin bags you need to buy priority but one cabin bag is allowed and standard sizes are mentioned. In the checking desk, they check your bag says only small cabin bag is allowed which is much smaller than the standard size and ask you to pay 25 Euro per bag that is Euro 100 for my family. I should have easily got much better airline for that amount of extra money. So readers, do not fly Ryanair they will con you to your last penny to make money.

We are disgusted by the way we have been treated by Ryanair staff and by all of the extra costs that were added. We were drawn to the airline due to the flights being the cheapest at the time, however would rather pay more for a professional, courteous service without the extra costs.

We weren¡¯t told as we got on the plane there was an issue and there were no signs on the seats, when we asked what was happening the flight attendant was rude and said the reason they were like that was they were obviously out of use and he¡¯d have to find somewhere else once everyone else was sat down. I had to stay in our 2 of our booked seats with my eldest and my wife had to sit at the front of the plane away from me with my two youngest on her own. It was a really bad end to our holiday. I contacted Ryanair customer service to complain that two of the key services I¡¯d paid extra for on our return flight hadn¡¯t been fulfilled, the customer service advisor was rude and arrogant and advised me in their T&C¡¯s you accept at the end that basically they can remove priority boarding and booked seats without explanation and we accept that when booking even if you have paid extra for it.

Don't have any comments on the catering as I didn't have the need to use it. The ground service varies between airports - the priority boarding is perhaps not worth the money so much as some people still end up cutting the line.

It's also clear on luggage restrictions, and penalties for not checking in online. My main criticism is that boarding, especially at Stansted, was chaotic: queuing down a stairwell, and then waiting a good 10 minutes on the tarmac in blistering heat.

Didn¡¯t weigh my hand luggage which was allowed to 10kg but it was actually about 15kg. Which I would have sucked up and paid had they weighed and told me. Since it¡¯s my problem not there¡¯s. They lay it out very clearly what the limit is so I don¡¯t know why people complain at being charged extra. Flight arrived in Aarhus on time after taking off ontime. Bags were on the belt  after passport control. Flight coming in was very very bumpy due to the weather but the pilot did very well to land so smooth. Flight home from Aarhus was again on time and actually arrived about 25 mins early. So we must have had good wind on our side. The leg room is minute. I am 5¡¯7 and pretty chubby & it was a struggle for my legs. My knees got bashed every time the person in front moved. The seats are ok, since Ryanair are a short haul company no one is going to break their backs on the seats. Friendly staff and a good clean cabin. Not dated like some airlines. I am terrified of flying but felt no more unsafe with them than I do with everyone else.  My flight was about ?25 return and baggage was ?30 each way - similar for all baggage costs.

We were unlucky to have an aborted take off due to possible bird-strike and the plane returned to stand. The pilot kept the passengers and cabin crew well informed when on the ground, even connecting the APU to keep us comfortable. It was decided that we should disembark with all hand luggage whilst an engineer was called to inspect the engine, and for any damage to be repaired and then signed off. This did take some time, and passengers were required to wait in the gate departure area until the Police des Fronti¨¨res had given permission for us (as a 'departed' international flight) to move into a larger area where there was a caf¨¦. 5 € vouchers were issued and the caf¨¦ coped well with an additional and unexpected 189 passengers who were on the ground for over 3 hours. The only frustrating part of our time in Strasbourg was the time delay in getting the permission from the Police des Fronti¨¨res and the lack of information ... not the fault of Ryanair, or the airport, which is an outstation without official Ryanair base representation only efficient and pleasant subcontractors. Ultimately engineers arrived and inspected the engine. The aircraft was signed off as safe to fly and we re-boarded with the same crew. The flight back was safe, uneventful and everyone was glad to be home. It is very easy to knock Ryanair for various aspects of their terms and conditions, but when it comes to safety they are second to none, and the responsible action by the flight deck, even though it involved a wait, shows what really matters in safe travel these days. And no, even with 'bird scaring' patrols, there is no guarantee that the little blighters will not come back to the same spot once the vehicle has gone.

Ryanair is now just a complete joke and pretty identical to the airlines depicted in come fly with me. Working out whether you¡¯ve paid for luggage or not is deliberately unclear and I¡¯d paid for only one way. You are deliberately seated apart, regardless of when you check in so you have to pay to sit together. Over two thirds of the plane had paid for priority boarding that comes with hand luggage so the queue was as long as if they hadn¡¯t. The team are completely disorganised and ended up rushing through on both flights despite not having to wait for any passengers, to avoid the departure slot. If I had a pound for every time someone arbitrarily needed to ¡°see¡± my boarding pass, without actually viewing it, I could¡¯ve saved the ?100 of additional hidden baggage fees. Over ?700 pounds to take a small hand luggage each and to have the audacity to want to sit with my partner in the equivalent of a supermarket deck chair. This is not budget. At all. I flew to four destinations in the states last year, totalling six flights and that cost ?2k. They¡¯ve monopolised the European destinations and have taken over airports so now they can charge whatever they like.

When I got to the airport a little less than two hours before the flight, I was charged an extra $95 for not checking in early. A male flight attendant was quite rude to me, and I did not do anything to warrant that. He seemed more interested in chatting up the female flight attendants than helping passengers. Once a passenger has booked a ticket, which I did months in advance, they e-mail you every day with annoying offers and irrelevancies. I did not unsubscribe because it would have prevented me from getting important flight updates.

So, the flight was slightly cheaper than EasyJet, and the times were better, so I thought it was a good idea to give Ryanair a whirl, but then I realised at Check in that we had to pay to sit together. It didn¡¯t bother me whether we did or not, so I didn¡¯t bother with that, but couldn¡¯t then check in until 48 hrs before the flight and had to print my boarding pass (eboarding pass not available). So, effectively, unless you are going somewhere with a printer, or for less than 48 hrs you had to book seats ahead, and therefore pay for them on the flight home! Then, as the tickets weren¡¯t priority (?), we had to pay for our bags on the way back (5 x ?25 = ?125 + ?39 for the seats added ?164 onto our bill). On top of this, the staff talked to us like we were stupid. Another customer, who was having the same issue was furious, and the staff were equally rude to him. To top it all off, the flight was delayed by half an hour without a mention or apology, the air hostess told us we had to give her our rubbish half an hour before landing or take it home, as she wanted to get home too! And then the luggage handlers broke one of our cases after paying for the privilege of putting it in the hold against my will.

There were no passengers left, only the staff. Then we were told we were two minutes late at the gate and they already deleted us from the passenger list so we won't be able to get on that flight.

They expect customers to pay all these extras for seating together, cabin luggage, I won't be surprised if they start charging for using a toilet during the flight!

I just don't understand why so many people still criticise this airline - you're paying budget prices - what do you expect? Just don't be an idiot and turn up with excess baggage or having not checked in. Ryanair must send about 10 reminders about this, but some people seem to still miss it. Or, they figure they will just do it anyway, and then stamp their feet to get an exception - don't bother - you're just wasting your time and money, and you will stress yourself out. My two detractors are 'priority' is not really priority these days, because half the plane has it, it should really be seen as a cabin suitcase surcharge, and I think Ryanair may as well just rename it as that. Also, if you have young kids, probably not the best choice because you will probably have to queue up a bit and use a bus to get from the gate to the plane.",positive,0.33656,0,35,9.047233,6.476972

We were given seats far apart but we did not mind. Outbound flight left on time, return flight used an air-bridge at departure airport - it's the 1st time I encountered this with this airline. This delayed the boarding process a lot, as people were only entering from the front and trying to swap seats in order to sit with their friends/partners/families and they were doing that with their hand luggage, causing a delay of departure of almost 50' (landing 20' late).

There was not the same sales sales sales as there was on a previous flight to Malta and the staff dimmed the cabin lights so children could get some sleep. Overall not bad but there is no overall consistency in the product, it depends on the crew.

This line took an hour. Several people in line missed their flights. When we got to our turn in this line, Ryanair for the 2nd time (once previously in Barcelona) accused me of not checking in and tried to charge 50 Euro fees per person to check in. Luckily, both times I had the app downloaded with proof that everyone had been checked in. The worker at the desk in Vienna made some phone calls and they ¡°waived the fee¡±. We made it through security and once to the gate things were hectic again. The Ryanair attendants were treating a couple from India quite terribly, accusing the woman of having a fake visa. This went on well into our boarding time before someone took the couple away. The young woman was visibly upset at the accusations and other passengers were upset with the way she was treated - regardless of her visa status. When the flight landed in London and people got off the plane, there wasn¡¯t a clear direction to go.

Recently I flew from Manchester to Marrakesh and Lisbon to Manchester so my information is up to date. It¡¯s as if Ryanair sets out to test is customers at every step from booking to check in to the moment you get off the plane and are finally free of them. Let¡¯s start with priority boarding. Don¡¯t bother as you will end up queuing in a stairwell with everyone else once you get through the gate. At Manchester we waited for half an hour in a stair way. Some of the older customers were really struggling. We should have been kept at the gate until they were actually ready for us to board. The same happened in Lisbon but this time we were left waiting by the runway with the fumes of the planes blasting over us. Ok then the seats.... the single worst seats I¡¯ve ever sat in on a plane. Rock hard, plastic covered monstrosities. They won¡¯t even tilt back. Awful. The seats actually cause pain. By the time you get on the plane the customers have lost all sense of composure. Their nerves are shot and they are boiling over with anger at the service that they have received. This causes an underlying feeling that someone is going to lose it and kick off. The cabin staff aren¡¯t interested and who can blame them. The must put up with this kind of thing every day. They aren¡¯t cheap flights either so it¡¯s no excuse.

The issue is that after I put my big bag in the storage place above our head and sat down, the stewardess took it out so she can put another clients bag there who was sitting several lines in front of us. She asked me to put my luggage next to my hand luggage under my feet, but it was uncomfortable. She kept apologizing, but realized that the luggage she was trying to put up there instead of mine was too big. So she sent that down.

The need to physically print a paper boarding pass for non EU or UK passengers is the only real headache and lacks sensibility. You can check in on the app, but then need to use a desktop computer and printer to get the boarding pass, which is absurd. With all that done, the flight was on time, plane was ok, crews good and in the end this was excellent value. Honestly, legacy carriers like BA for short haul don't really provide more than Ryanair.

Then if you don¡¯t pay extra again for your seat they make sure one of you is at the front of the aeroplane and the other is at the back.

Now it was 2 hours to the flight that facility was closed and we'd have to pay 55 euros each extra. The original flight cost was only ?71 each return so that was too much. A rip off. Fair enough to charge us a bit but not that much. Then we were given our seat numbers and surprise surprise we weren't seated together even though the plane was half empty. We then proceeded on the plane to all swap seats so people were sat next to each other which because of all the empty seats was no problem.

In Copenhagen we stayed in an apartment without access to a printer. Also, I didn¡¯t know checkin had to be done a minimum of 2 hours in advance through the internet, as this was not mentioned at all on the Print-outs of the e-tickets. Upon arrival at the checkin area, we were informed we had to pay 60 EUR per person because our checkin was not done on time (we arrived there 1h and 50 minutes before flight time), which meant an additional Eur 240 for the 4 of us. We were not the only ones concerned and just next to me was a handicapped couple, which also needed to pay. Such kind of business practices are just unbearable and fraudulent, because this information was not mentioned anywhere. Apart from Ryanair I totally do not understand how airport staff can accept such business behaviour, because at the end it¡¯s them who force the people to pay. These people are no Ryanair employees, in fact there is no Ryanair office, nor Ryanair employees in the whole of Scandinavia. Also in Stuttgart airport there are no Ryanair people present at all. I would feel ashamed pushing through such policies on the back of the customers and I do not understand how people can go to work every day under such circumstances, because obviously they have to deal with many unhappy and sometimes angry passengers, who just feel nailed by such business practices. Well, I learned from this experience that I will never fly Ryanair again, neither for work, nor for holidays. And for sure my two kids will never fly Ryanair again either.

So we book our flight in March for today, 20th April 2019. We checked in yesterday and paid for the selected seats (after already having acquired Priority and 2 Cabin Bags) for 2 travellers. We leave Wales at night and get to the Stansted airport more than 3h prior to departure. The flight was scheduled at 6:25. At 5:10 still nothing is showing on the screens, so I go to the toilet and then we head straight to security. As soon as we get through security we look at the screen again (around 5:40) and the screen says ""Final Call"". Being in a a rush we run through the queues and head to gate 59. When we get there we get told that it's actually gate 91 (other side of the airport) and the lady says ""there's only 2 minutes left, you won't make it"". We ask whether she can make a call to advise we are on our way and this obviously was declined. So we start running again, with backpacks and hold luggages, to get to the right gate. This was very difficult to find and the airport staff we asked weren't that helpful. As expected we don't make it on time. We make our way to the ""Returning Customers"" gates and the airport lady did not even give advise on where to go or what to do, but simply cancelled our boarding passes and wished us a ""lovely weekend"". Lovely Easter weekend: stuck in an airport and our families waiting for us overseas! Ok, so we lose the money paid (around ?90) but we don't give up on spending our holidays with our relatives and friends! So we buy the next available flight from Stansted to Rome: 13:25 same day, with Ryanair. We pay the tickets, pay for the 10kg bags and do the check-in straight away. Having travelled with Ryanair for many years I knew that they are able to refund part of the original ticket price (€100 or ?79), to use this money towards the cost of the new booking. This is apparently only applicable in certain circumstances, one of which is if you show up at the Ryanair desk not later than 1h after the original departure time. We get into the queue 15/20 min before the deadline and wait for about 30 min, to then be told by the two very unhelpful and disregarded agents (who had not a clue of what this process is), that we had to speak to the Money Exchange team. We leave the queue and wait to speak to this lady who, obviously, said ""I have nothing to do with flights"". Customer Service was terrible to say the least. What happened to the ""Gate Open"" and ""Boarding"" announcements on the screen? Is it a new trend to jump straight to the last call? To cause people stress, sickness, anxiety and everything else that comes with missing a flight, including massive extra financial expenses? Or is this just the way airlines operate today? Playing sick games to ensure people miss flights and spend extra money? Initially I mentioned that this was not my first misfortune with Ryanair: 3 years ago, summer time, my flight was delayed by 3 hours...my solicitors told me that my claim for refund/compensation has been placed on hold due to Ryanair having too many complaints and not dealing with them. We are currently about ?300 short due to failure to follow the process on the screen, failing to call our names for the last call (we had priority, there was plenty of time!), plus the hours lost hanging around waiting for another flight.",negative,-0.722346,0,35,9.047233,6.476972

We did not have enough cash on us and had to borrow money from some random people who were as baffled as we were by this scam move right before getting on the plane.

? Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Barcelona,19-Apr,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Manchester to Barcelona. Read the fine print very carefully. I did not, and I paid dearly.  Luggage: included in the cost is what you can fit under the seat in front of you. It appears they purposefully spread your group out in the cabin. For example, I had an empty seat next to me on one of our flights, yet they didn't seat my young daughter and I together. She was in the rear of the plane and I was up front. Seating together costs extra. Technically they charge for choosing your seat, but again, my opinion is that it seems they make an effort to spread families around the plane unless you pay for the seating option. Their check-in process is a scam. You will receive an email 3 days before travel telling you to check in online or you will be charged 55 pounds. Okay, fair enough because they have warned you with a personal email, until you try to check in. After you enter all your passport and personal information for you and your party and go through all that hassle and get to the end of the check-in process, they'll tell you that you have to pay a fee to check in prior to 48 hours before departure. If you forget (like I did) and remember to do so once you arrive at the airport 1 hour and 59 minutes before your flight (like I did) and try to check in online, it will cost you 55 pounds per ticket.  Here's the process: a) Wait in the queue at check in. The check in person informs you that you owe a fee. She fills out the a form (by hand) that you have to take to customer service. Wait in the queue at customer service. Pay your fee (which for us doubled the cost of our tickets). They fill out another form by hand (including credit card information by hand) and stamp it. You have to take this new form back to check in. Wait for a second time in the check in queue. You hand her this second form and she finally issues the boarding passes. Run to security because although you arrived 1 hour and 59 minutes early, most of that time has now been spent in 3 queues just to get a boarding pass. Again, read the fine print and understand what you are in fo. I recognize my own failings working with Ryanair, but it really seems like their process is designed to cause a certain number of passengers to fail at their game and when you fail, you pay so dearly.",negative,-0.359465,0,35,9.047233,6.476972

The other rip off is the fee if you forget to check in within 2hrs of your flight. I have used Ryanair all my life, to regularly visit family in Ireland, and go to destinations in Europe, regularly noting their desperate and greedy attempts to extort more money from their customers/captive audience for things that were previously included within the ticket price.

This was my 5th flight with Ryanair in 7 days, and following the previous experiences with Ryanair this flight had high standards to meet. Immediately after getting off the bus from the terminal I noticed this aircraft was fitted with the old style of Ryanair cabin, this was to be expected but not to be looked forward too.  When the safety demonstration was being performed it came across that the crew simply could not be bothered with their jobs and just wanted to be at home. After takeoff the crew continued to look fed up and put no effort into providing a decent onboard service for customers. When pushing the trolley through the aircraft they seemed to show the most attention to those customers who were sat on the left hand side of the plane. The announcements made by the crew were inaudible, partly due to an accent issue and partly due to the poor PA system fitted to this aircraft. The only time I saw the crew look happy was upon landing in Edinburgh when they were seeing us off the flight. Overall, I was very disappointed by this service, especially compared to my previous experiences with the company over the last week and hope that it was simply a one time scenario and not something more common place across the company.",negative,-0.538463,0,35,9.047233,6.476972

Uncomfortable seating, unhelpful staff, dirty plane, stressed hostesses asking passengers to sit down, I have a lot of experience on flights with many companies and I consider that Ryanair is by far the worst experience a traveler can find, low quality and deceptive policies with the passengers. ES:  Experiencia totalmente decepcionante, Ryanair tiene una pol¨ªtica cuestionable en lo relativo a las maletas, tuve que realizar un primer pago por embarcar una maleta peque?a de peso inferior a 10 kilos, al embarcar tuve que pagar 20€ extra por no haber facturado la maleta, finalmente el coste del vuelo es m¨¢s caro por este motivo, hubo otro sobrecoste para poder elegir asiento pues el sistema de asignaci¨®n de asientos te asigna asientos separados de tus familiares para que tengas que pagar un extra para viajar juntos. Asientos inconfortables, staff nada servicial, avi¨®n sucio, las azafatas estresadas pidiendo a los pasajeros que se sienten, tengo mucha experiencia en vuelos con muchas compa?¨ªas y considero que Ryaniar es con diferencia la peor experiencia que un viajero puede encontrar, baja calidad y enga?osas pol¨ªticas con los pasajeros.",positive,0.435867,0,35,9.047233,6.476972

A flawless flight with Ryanair, which started at convenient and small Airport Weeze. Annoying waiting outside in the cold before boarding, but I can understand why: FR's middle name is efficiency, so it's better to have all passengers lined up in front of the plane. We had two pieces of hand luggage and were on seats 1A and 1B which was great. Miles of legroom and no-one besides us. Plane departed on time but had to make a detour because of a strike in Belgium. Therefore flight took a little over 4 hours but not the airline's fault. Nice crew which made two rounds with reasonably priced food and drinks. Inbound flight equal: on time and comfortable because of seats at the emergency seat, which is well worth the euros on a 3,5 hrs long flight.

It is no longer airline for normal travellers. Service is terrible on every level and with all additional charges for even a small luggage, seat selection, insurance etc this airline became high price. If you add the poor service on every level: ticket purchase, luggage acceptance etc this airline is most likely on their way down. It is obvious that with all extra charges even for a 10kg luggage (25€ - what passanger flies with a lap top bag only) the true ticket price is hidden and this is a price cheating. On the top many of their flights due to charging for a luggage at the gate, are late. Therefore if you book a flight with Ryanair be careful since your ticket price can easily double with their extra charges. For the business people the ward of advise regarding Ryanair - do never use them. If someone aske for a value for money what Ryanair offers I am quick to say 1 of 10 where 1 being terrible. A ward of caution for the Ryanair management, there were several airline trying to squeeze every penny from their passangera/clients in the past and it was good to see they became airline from the past.",negative,-0.812901,0,35,9.047233,6.476972

We were instantly met with a disrespectful attitude that was unprompted. We were sent to a different counter to print the boarding passes for 44 euro. Coming back to the check in counter we were met with more scolding for having bags that exceeded the weight limit. The employee was basically appalled that we had extra weight and again sent us to the other counter to pay for being overweight (205 extra euros!). We already knew before coming to the airport that we were going to have to pay a fee for the extra weight so again we were met with unprompted disrespect; we even told this employee that we understood we had to pay more and we¡¯re okay with that but again his reaction was demeaning and unwarranted. We did not talk back nor initiate any disrespectful dialogue and hence why I am prompted to write this review. We barely made our flight because we were setback with these additional waits which I believe all the services should be done at one counter. This whole experience put a really bad taste in my mouth with this airline. I never got the name of the person who was so rude to us because we were so frantic to get our boarding passes and paying for extra weight. I am displeased with the customer service presented. This person needs to learn how to be respectful and accommodating rather than scolding at a stressful environment to begin with.

When we noticed the error, we first tried finding a solution through a Live Chat with Ryanair. They kept asking for the email address with which the flight was booked.

When I tried to manage my booking to change the name, they wanted to charge 382 Euros--a ridiculous price set by the airline (and the cost of 2 new tickets). And it turns out that no one could do anything for us. When we tried to cancel the flight, not only were we unable to recoup even the cost of the prepaid luggage fees, but kiwi.com would charge a 20 Euro cancellation fee.

? Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Thessaloniki to Bologna,19-Jan,1,1,1,1,,1,1,no,1," I was flying from Thessaloniki to Bologna. The weather was terrible (heavy snowstorm) and a lot of flights were either cancelled or rerouted. However what happened with Ryanair was unprecedented. Although all passengers from other airline companies were brought to their hotels by around 2.30 in the morning, passengers from 3 Ryanair flights were moved out of the airport at around 7.00 in the morning. In the beginning, the company did not officially cancel the flights so we were not allowed to take our luggage. Afterwards, we were not properly informed whether we should change our tickets (Ryanair was not going to send an aircraft the next day, so passengers would have to wait 2 or 3 days at least to fly to their destinations). ask for a refund or wait to catch a flight the next day. In addition, the online application did not work, so we had to form endless queues for any option we wanted to follow. In general, the situation was chaotic. The company is totally disorganised and left 3 or 4 employees (for whom there is absolutely no complaint, they were trying to do their best) to deal with more than 400-500 passengers (from 3 flights) without having the proper instructions from their headquarters. During the whole night that we stayed in the airport, I was under the impression that the company policy was to make us book our own hotels and therefore save the company some cash. In that respect, Ryanair vouchers are half the price compared to the other companies and they are being announced in a -kind of- secret way!!! The next day the weather was sunny so Ryanair started accommodating the flights of that day, so that the company would not have to deal with more delays, refunds etc. This resulted in the passengers of the already delayed flights being stranded at the airport for 2-3 days without any information (their flights were not even shown in the ""departures"" table). The situation was ""resolved"" when incredibly angry customers demanded to catch the next Ryanair aircraft available. After a lot of fights with the personnel and the person in charge of the airline (police presence was deemed necessary) I believe we finally boarded a plane with a different original destination. Flight was acceptable, although Ryanair did not even consider offering a bottle of water to the passengers. Do yourselves a favour, give some extra money and travel with a different company. No matter what the weather conditions are, you will at least be treated with respect, like normal human beings (again I am talking about the policy of the company, not the personnel in particular).",negative,-0.507279,0,35,9.047233,6.476972

Ryanair tries to rip-off their customers with their new & confusing baggage allowance policies. They wanted to charge us twice for the exact same piece of luggage (regular carry-on luggage), just ridiculous. We bought two regular Ryanair tickets approx. 3 weeks prior departure for 225€ (round-trip) per ticket on the Ryanair website. When I tried to check-in online, I realized you have to pay for luggage larger than a laptop case. We decided to check-in at the airport in FRA and asked at the counter whether our Ryanair ticket for 225€ really does not include a regular carry-on sized piece of luggage? They told us no and we had to pay 10€ per carry-on luggage/way extra, which means that we paid 40€ for our small, only luggage for the out- & inbound flight additionally. Consequently, our ticket FRA-KRK-FRA added up to a total of 245€ pp. Definitely not a low cost price, but unfortunately, we had no other option. We paid the additional costs without big discussions and received an invoice, clearly stating our names and the amount of 40€ in total for the in- and outbound flight for two. When we were flying back to FRA from KRK, they wanted to charge us again for the exact same carry-on luggage we have already paid for despite showing them the invoice. The Ryanair staff behaved unreasonably and did not even show a bit of understanding (even other people passing by were saying that the baggage regulations are really confusing) and were just threatening us to either pay or stay in KRK! I was showing them my invoice and saying that I am not gonna pay one more additional penny and they instantly said that we would have to stay. I was freaking out in front of all passengers and it took 5 more minutes of discussions, threats and shouting until they finally let us go without paying. I will never fly Ryanair again that is for sure, even if  other airlines would be more expensive. ",negative,-0.772231,0,34,8.948586,6.786717

I asked if there was any compensation for changing the flights but as soon as I mention the word compensation my chat ends (goes off line). The sad part was I booked my coach seats in advance too and I couldn't change the time as it cost fee nearly half of the coach price to make amendments. So we arrive very early at Luton airport.

The queue for priority boarding was 100 people long when I joined the queue and even longer behind me after 30 minutes. The non - priority queue? 4 people when I joined the queue and about 20 or so when boarding started. So you pay for priority to carry your case on board? Don't bother - the non priority queue had cases just like mine. But the non priority queue on the other side of the barrier will board after the priority queue? Are you kidding? the non priority queue got on the same bus at the same time as the priority queue and a lot quicker as well as there were so few of them. Nobody supervised the gate - the automatic door opened and we all got onto the bus together. The gate number was 90. On board, it was fine - I had a window seat on both journeys (despite not paying for a seat reservation) and was happy counting the revenue stream as the bags were loaded into the aircraft hold. I counted several thousand pounds worth of revenue for Ryanair on the assumption that the bags were priced at ?25 each. Ryanair are very clever in convincing the flying public to pay for priority when there is no priority - and even more clever in marketing the product so that the majority of your passengers actually take the option. I suggest that as the public catch on to this cunning revenue maximising plan you will have to change the rules again as ""priority"" boarding is probably breaking some trade description act and the public aren't stupid. However, despite this little rant, don't forget that Ryanair does offer exceptionally low prices and if it wasn't for them and other similar low cost carriers we'd still be paying extortionate prices to the likes of BA and Aer Lingus and moaning about their high fares and poor service levels.

I visited the Facebook and read the running volume, that the support is bad or there is no compensation. So you can be lucky if everything runs smoothly or bad luck.

It is a low cost flight company but we are not animals and even the animals should not be treated like they did with us. The day when this company will close down will be the best day for everybody. My last flight with them was very bad and unbeliveable. I departed from Naples to Bergamo where I had a stop and then from Bergamo to London Stansted. Unfortunately due to the very bad weather, the pilot has decided to land in Verona instead of Bergamo for safety reasons. My flight from Bergamo to London would be departed in 1 hour They have organized the transfer to Bergamo by buses (almost 2 hours) and when we arrived finally to Bergamo, my flight had already left. I went to the Ryanair's ticket office to ask to get the first flight to London Stansted. There I found the worst service ever seen: no customer service, no support, no understanding, crazy queue, only 2 desks and they called you by numbers. It Was a nightmare after a long day. When finally was my turn and together with passengers with my same issue, we have asked to get the first flight to London because was not our fault to have missed the flight. They replied to us that they would have inserted us in a waiting list and they have asked to charge 100 euros each passenger to get the first flight available that maybe would be departed even the day after. All of that without hotel, even a bottle of water. This is absolutely shameful! I really needed to be in London asap and I have decided to pay the fee and fortunately I got the next flight to London. Of course I am trying to get the refund with our solicitors and I will ask even the apologies from them. PS: The lady that works at the Ryanair point in Naples airport (Monday Morning 29th of October) should be fired and she need a very long training.

Far too much hand luggage was allowed on board. The cabin crew were not friendly nor proactive and their spoken English was poor.

Very unprofessional. The second time coming back was actually very good. The flight was schedule to depart at 6:30am and it boarded and left and arrived exactly on time. The flight attendants were fine and professional. I guess the key is to choose the first Ryanair flight that leaves first thing in the morning. That way their airplanes are already on the ground and finished their maintenance checks. Their schedules are so packed that if one flight gets delayed during the day, it creates a domino effect that delays every subsequent flight. In conclusion, pretty good value.

On this recent return trip to Corfu, flights are generally delayed to some extent. Previously we always found Ryanair to be very efficient in terms of keeping to departure times. However, boarding process and splitting people up has caused chaos on board. I can understand the theory behind thir policy, and personally, for an extra couple of € I would reserve seat together. But a lot of people still take pot luck, get seats allocated apart and then try throughout the boarding process, taxi, after take off to persuade others to change seats in order that they can sit together. Middle seats being allocated in premium seating (extra leg room, front seats that others pay €15 for). Their boarding process needs to be more streamlined as well, example, boarding at Corfu for Priority, no signs etc. to indicate where to queue. Got through gate, only to be held outside, busses arrived, but for some reason we were not allowed on them for 10 minutes, then a free for all with non-priority and priority getting on buses together. In reality, if another airline is similar in price I would chose them now over Ryanair as the whole travel process has become more chaotic, which is a shame, as with a few improvements and a bit better organisation not costing any money, it could be a far better experience.",negative,-0.48196,0,34,8.948586,6.786717

While I understand that Ryanair is a low cost airline I find their tactics for squeezing extra money out of you distasteful. Everything is extra. For example if you would like to sit with your partner you need to pay for that privilege otherwise you'll be seated randomly. At the airport you will be treated like cattle. We were boarded for our flight and then left standing on a ramp in Malaga airport for 30 minutes while they cleaned the aircraft. The seats are uncomfortable and the service is lacking. The fact that half of their employees are currently striking for better conditions shows how badly they are treated. This translates into employees who really don't care what happens.

Of course the price of these flights were astronomical but we had no alternative as we could not stay four days without flying back home. We put a claim on their site to ask for compensation for cancellation and the refund of the difference between their flight and the new flight we had bought. The answer is: not reimbursing the new flight as we opted for reimbursement of our tickets, and no compensation since the flight was 'cancelled unexpectedly'. This must be the most ridiculous motive to not compensate for cancellation. Other than that: Ground service obviously did not do their job as they did not offer an alternative route (except four days later) and should have offered a place to stay for the night (it was 23.30 when we left the airport). Value for money in this case is terrible: we were refund but somehow lost 10€ between paid and refund, had to buy new tickets from our own pocket at expensive rate.

Schoenefeld Airport was quieter than I had seen it, but the usual crush at the inadequately-designed followed, although boarding staff kept good control of the boarding process. Aircraft arrived early, but I could see through the window that offloading from the previous flight was taking a long time, with only one person wearing a ""Swissport Duty Station Manager"" hi viz vest directing the passengers on his own until more staff turned up and put in rear stairs and started offloading luggage. This caused a delay on departure, and the Captain apologised for the heat in the cabin, which was caused by a ""lack of air conditioning power units"" at the airport, but I could see when we were departing the aircraft needed an air start unit, so obviously there was an issue with the aircraft's ground power. This resulted in a total delay of around 30 minutes, but at least the cabin cooled down during taxi to the runway. The crew were friendly, they did their jobs efficiently and although they were a mix of nationalities, the tannoy announcements in English were very clear by the 3 different crew members who made them (something that admittedly is not always the case on Ryanair flights). Two rounds of drinks and refreshments were served and one duty free trolley run performed with an announcement about special offers etc. No inflight magazines were given out on this flight, which I don't mind as I was not planning to buy anything, but may have stopped other people from purchasing items. We landed 15 minutes late in Glasgow and rear stairs were positioned quickly on the aircraft for quick disembarking.

In a nutshell: I was travelling from Budapest to London Stansted. The flight had more than 2 hours delay when leaving Budapest. When we arrived in London at late night we had to wait almost 30 minutes to get out of the plane, since no bus was available to pick us up. After other 30 minutes queuing at passport control, we had to wait almost one hour for the luggage before we were informed that it could take few hours to be delivered, since there were no worker available (apparently they were on holidays or on strike). There were many passengers from other flights in the same condition. There was only a Ryanair representative, clearly overwhelmed and unable to deal with the situation. He finally provided us with a number to call the day after to have more information about our luggage. He did not tell us to file any report nor he provided us with any written information. When I left the airport it was 3am and no trace of my bag. The day after I tried to call that number maybe 20-30 times and none never picked up the phone. I had several chats with Ryanair representatives on the Ryanair website and I was just told to call the same number which doesn¡¯t work or where nobody picks up the calls. I was told further by Ryanair representatives on the chat that when I call that number they will be able to fill with me a missing luggage report, because without it nobody can do anything. As I said before, the Ryanair representative at the airport did not mention that we had to file such a report, but he just provided us with the mentioned number to call. I have also filed several reports and complaints via Ryanair website by using different forms, nobody came back to me with any response. If I wanted to file a query with Ryanair Baggage Claim Form, I could not do it, without the missing luggage report number. Ryanair didn¡¯t provide any different number where I could speak to someone who could effectively provide for help. I was finally advised to go to the airport to look for my luggage personally, since they could not do anything to help me. When I asked if I was going to be reimbursed for the travel expenses and for the time spent to go the airport, Ryanair representatives said that it was unlikely. Today still no trace of my luggage, I have received no answer to my emails and complaints, and the famous number is still not working.

On my flight from BTS to STN at 6:30 in the morning everything was excellent with the airline. It was on time, staff were nice and friendly. The only issue I've had during the boarding process was because of Bratislava airport staff but that has nothing to do with Ryanair. I have one complaint but I do understand it. Checking in we got our seats seperated, but with the ticket price Ryanair sells, it's still cheap even after buying Selected seats. The food on board was cold, but when I asked the crew to heat it some more they kindly offered to do so. After landing the process was quick, but due to some issues at Stansted (which I learned happens often) we waited over an hour for our luggage. Having arrived soon in the morning and not having had any coach/train reservation for a specific time, this wasn't an issue for me. On my way back I would have things to complain about, but I'm not sure how much of it is Ryanair's fault. The airport was crowded, we waited a long time to depart or even board, apparently because checked in luggage hadn't arrived to the plane yet. We had out gate announced on time and having a 1 hour delay isn't too bad considering it's an evening flight by a budget company. The crew were again nice even though they had a whole day of work behind them. I wouldn't complain about the seats and comfort. Of course it wasn't perfect, but it wasn't uncomfortable and I would definitely fly Ryanair again.

They are by far the worst company I have ever had to deal with, light years behind any other organisation in terms of good customer relations. If everything goes smoothly you may get a bargain flight but when things go wrong, (12 hour delay) they go catastrophically wrong. Ryanair have zero customer support at the airport or via the phone. They leave their passengers without food or explanation of the cause of the delay. They admit fault after multiple phone calls and emails and accept they are liable for compensation under EU261 guidelines. They then use every possible delay tactic and lie there way through every email and web chat conversation for months in the hope that the customer will give up asking for their refund. I have been waiting five months for a refund and have now had to pay out of my own pocket to take Ryanair to a small claims court. I suspect they will ignore these demands and carry on taking peoples money and ignoring any requests for customer service. I urge anyone thinking about purchasing a flight through this joke of a company to just take 1 minute to search for any review site online and see how bad they really are before you part with your money.

Overall I arrived 2 hours later than what was listed with zero communication from the airline besides an apology text to my phone the next day. The whole experience was not acceptable, even from a company that seems to have a reputation for this type of experience. he flight was the most uncomfortable and rocky flight I've ever experienced (and I'm someone that usually enjoys flying). Ryanair preaches low cost, however considering the multitude of ridiculous extra fees (e.g you have to pay upwards of €15 for a seat even though you've already purchased a ticket?), the consistent delays, the lack of communication, the uncomfortable flights, and the low quality customer service, it is in my opinion far more worth avoiding this company and paying the little bit extra it costs to fly with another airline to guarantee a stress-free flying experience.",negative,-0.893646,0,34,8.948586,6.786717

First time ever to fly with Ryanair and this has been an absolute disappointment from the very beginning to the end. Booked my ticket in May 2018 thinking I had a bargain compared to the prices shown by other airlines. I even selected the priority option costing a little extra. This meant I could carry a 10kg bag with a small bag. Arrived at the airport to drop my suitcase but was told I had to pay ?50 because I didn't have this on my ticket. Completely shocked I argued but of course had no choice but to pay. After this the flight was delayed for almost 3 hours didn't arrive at my destination until 2am for a conference I had to attend by 8.30 the following morning. Well, thinking the nightmare was over and glad to have survived the ordeal. On my flight back, I thought perhaps the ?50 I paid would have covered both leg of my trip only to be told that I needed to pay another ?50 on my way back. Making a total of ?100 pounds excluding the cost of my original ticket which was ?98. While queuing pay for the cost of my laugage, I met several families who had exactly thesame problem as myself. Ryanair needs to state the exact cost implications of their flights. Now if I had known that this flight would have cost me almost ?200, I certainly would have flown with British Airways without any doubt. Well, you learn every day.

I was passed through security, appeared at the gate in plenty of time, but at the time to board I was told to go all the way back through security to a miniscule and obscure check-in desk to have my US passport checked for my flight to Prague. It didn't matter one bit that the Czech Republic is visa-free for US citizens, only that I was required to do this. Of course I was not able to make the flight, but even worse the gate attendant was outright rude, stating it was not her fault. The gist of it is she was right, but her completely unhelpful attitude also tripped out at least 4 other US citizens on the same flight. This regularly happens due to poor ground training and procedures. After writing a complaint to Ryanair customer service the response was predictable, no apology, it is the passengers' responsibility to check the visa requirements. Ryanair needs to amend their procedures and place a qualified individual after security and before boarding so there is no longer the need for paying customers to be inconvenienced by missing their flight.

We had limited time where we were going as we were on vacation. So we decided to book with another airline (same day meant that it was very expensive). The customer service representative told us we qualified for compensation to make up some of the extra cost, and actually told us it was a good thing we got on another airline with how quickly all their flights were filling up. When filing for that compensation, we were told the cancellation was outside of their control so they would only refund the flight. We were given many reasons why the flight was cancelled by various airport and airline employees.

My flight was delayed by almost 3 hours, resulting in an arrival in Germany at 1am. When Ryanair does the basics well, it is a very good airline. I want to get to my destination safely and an on-time. I have used Ryanair for many years because it never seems to compromise on safety and has had an excellent on-time record.  Something is going wrong with flights from London Stansted, which, I believe, is Ryanair's largest base, as measured by aircraft and passenger numbers. When I travelled to Nuremberg, I noticed that a large number of flights were leaving with delays - my own flight's delay was the longest but delays of 40-60 minutes seemed routine. People have told me that there is an ongoing problem with Swissport, the ground agents at Stansted airport. This may be so but, at the end of the day, Ryanair is responsible for the agencies with which it has contracts and for the operation of its flights. When a ground agent is not available to staff a gate, that is, and should be, a reflection of Ryanair. in the case of my flight to Nuremberg, I was told that the plane was flying with delays because of a concatenation of events: a technical problem leading to a plane change earlier in the day; ongoing problems with Swissport; a loss of slot because of late servicing of aircraft by Swissport; ATC restrictions. The short flight passed without incident and the crew were competent and efficient.

A lady from the crew came and she didn¡¯t had an answer regarding how long the delay will be, I asked to be kept informed about this issue and she replied that she will ask the pilot to make an announcement. Nothing happened. No messages from Wizz Air company regarding the delay, no information provided by the crew members. I was just waiting knowing nothing. After another 20 min of waiting I see other lady from the crew coming out from the pilot cabin. Thinking that she may know something by now, especially because she stayed with the Capitan, I activated again the service button so I can ask her about the delay. She then came to me asking me straight away if I speak Romanian to which I replied yes. Then she asked me again if I'm sure I speak Romanian and I replied that for the last 40 years I keep on talking Romanian daily as I'm a Romanian citizen. This questions put me in such embarrassment and discomfort. I felt like a child at the kindergarten. The lady crew member then told me that ¡°this is not a bus to answer how long the delay will be¡± to which I replied that I know and as well I haven't paid ?1 for the ticket. Then, the lady crew member saw that I was having my mobile phone in my hand and told me that filming the crew is not allowed and asked me to delete the video. I replied to her that I did not film the crew or the cabin to which she demanded to handle my phone to her so she could check if there is any video with the crew. I refused to give her my personal item because she doesn't have the legal right to ask me this and only the competent authorities can ask for this. She then called the Frontier Police to escort me out from the plane. I need to specify that during the whole interaction between me and the lady crew member I had a decent language, I didn't engage other passengers, I wasn't aggressive with anyone, I wasn¡¯t under the influence of any substance and I did no damage. Even being escorted I kept my calm. The lady crew member gave me a paper called ¡°the final warning¡± in which she mentioned the fact that I was talking loud and bad towards the crew and I refused to delete the video with the crew. Which video, which bad words? I did not had the right to reply or to agree or disagree with what she wrote down on the ¡°the final warning¡± sheet. The Frontier Police said that not even they are allowed to ask me to handle my personal item. This lady crew member attitude put me in such a big discomfort from all points of view.

There is no prominent information indicating that passengers need to complete online check-in before arriving at the counter, or they will face a penalty. This detail is buried at the bottom of the page, which many people, especially first-time travelers, may not notice. As a result, I found myself in a long queue at the airport only to be informed that I had to pay a penalty of AED 190 for not checking in online. This was a huge disappointment and a stressful experience. I strongly urge Wizz Air to update their website and app to clearly inform passengers about the necessity of online check-in to avoid such penalties. In addition to the check-in issue, Wizz Air has numerous hidden clauses and additional charges that passengers need to be aware of. While the initial ticket price appears low, they start adding various fees, such as admin fees and charges for baggage over 10 kg. This deceptive practice results in a much higher final cost than initially advertised. I booked with Wizz Air only once, and I will never make that mistake again. I do not recommend this airline to anyone.

At Luton Airport, Wizz Air management starts boarding passengers through the gate when the aircraft isn¡¯t there. In turn theres 237 passengers jammed in a single area, on board (LTN-AMM) the crew were very attentive and energized, However the hype for Christmas was also uncomfortable as they kept making announcements every 10 minutes on a evening/night flight when everyone was already tired. I would suggest Wizz Air to at least make their Amman service a more comfortable flight since its a 6h one. On the way back on the 1st - the flight was much better mainly because there were less passengers. A crew member on the aircraft was specifically very rude with my family. We thought to ourselves she may just be tired, therefore we didn¡¯t really say anything. However that wasn¡¯t an excuse to constantly speak in a negative manner. I can¡¯t complain much in the sense that Wizz Air does its job as a budget airline but there¡¯s some management concerns which the airline should address to make the experience a bit more human. Being budget doesn¡¯t mean that you should expect a negative experience I would also say that the onboard menu prices are just inhumane. ?5 for a cheese baguette which is 10cm in length? - no thanks.

So I had to pay my hotel myself. Had to book a flight myself. All the costs for transportation myself. Food myself. They ignore passenger laws, I filed two tickets with them by now.

The gate service did not asked me if I would volunteer, nor that I would be denied boarding. The flight was delayed more than 1 hour, when I was at the gate checking my boarding pass for boarding I was just ordered to step away and not allowed boarding without any explanation. When I insisted for information what was happening, the ground service girl just told me that Wizz Air had overbooked the flight and somebody else had taken my seat. I was ordered leave the gate and go to complain to Wizz Air. I was given no information what I have to do, where to go, what were my rights, just behaving rude and arrogant, ignoring.

Experience for Dammam to Abu Dhabi for 23/6/2023 - Check-in was over the counter at the airport. Flight got delayed by almost 2 hrs and nobody knew what was the reason. No complimentary refreshment was given even after this huge time delay. I missed my connecting bus and reached my hotel very late at midnight due to this delay. Experience for Abu Dhabi to Dammam for 30/6/2023 - Now this is the real deal. When we reached the airport for check-in we were informed that we have online check-in option during booking. So they will charge to do check-in at the airport. That charge is almost 2 times of the cost of ticket. Wow! By the way, they will put every details like food choice, weight limits along with all useless info in ticket but they will never mention compulsory web check-in option in ticket and charges for not complying it. Also they are so caring to send you useless mail before departure to remind you to check about destination visa but never remind you to do web check-in which is only option as per their understanding and its penalty. This strategy was used to loot almost 10 more passengers who were there on the same flight. They were also cheated in the same manner and they seemed really upset which spoiled their vacation.

After checking in, we proceeded to gate 17 for departure. However at the departure gate, we were informed that the flight's cabin baggage capacity was full, and they asked us to leave our carry-on bags there. They gave us tags and assured us we could collect our bags from the airport belt later. Since we only had our carry-on bags with us, my sister and I had packed everything essential, including clothes, undergarments, makeup, toiletries, footwear, and my tablet in those bags. Upon arriving at Antalya Airport, we were dismayed to find that our bags were not on the belt. We immediately filed a complaint, but the response from the complain center was that our bags were still in Abu Dhabi; they hadn't been loaded onto the plane. Now, my sister and I are left with only our small cross bags, containing just our passports and money. We have nothing else to wear or use. Our plan was to continue from Antalya to Trabzon, but without our bags, that seem to be impossible.

Firstly, during the booking process, I was bombarded with various hidden fees. What appeared to be a reasonably priced ticket quickly turned into a financial burden.

Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Palma Mallorca to Gatwick,22-Sep,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  As a frequent traveler who has experienced countless flights with various airlines, I feel compelled to share my recent nightmarish encounter with Wizz Air. This scathing review serves as a warning to fellow travelers who value their time, money, and overall peace of mind. Brace yourself for a tale of incompetence, broken promises, and an utter lack of customer care. Let's begin with the initial offense: the cancellation of our flight without any plausible reason. We got an email the morning of our departure so we rushed to the airport to get some clarity only to be informed that your flight has been abruptly scrapped. Shockingly, Wizz Air failed to provide any legitimate explanation for this cancellation, leaving passengers bewildered and stranded without any clue as to what transpired behind the scenes. Additionally, they didn't have an option for both me and my partner to fly out until 3 days later which wouldn't work because of our work schedules. In a desperate bid for assistance, I reached out to Wizz Air's customer service while at the Palma airport. Little did I know that I was about to embark on an infuriating journey of unhelpful agents and contradictory statements. Despite assuring us that we would be reimbursed if we chose to book an alternative flight outside their company, this turned out to be nothing more than a hollow promise. They had no intention of honoring their commitment, leaving us in a state of financial uncertainty and deep disappointment. Refusing to give up, we sought professional help from an external company, hoping they could navigate the treacherous waters of Wizz Air's reimbursement process. Unfortunately, this only added insult to injury. Nine long and arduous months later, we are still fighting for the reimbursement we rightfully deserve. It is inconceivable that an airline, claiming to value its customers, could display such a blatant disregard for their responsibilities. Wizz Air's inability to provide a backup flight for three days highlights their lack of contingency planning and their disregard for the inconvenience caused to their passengers. Furthermore, their callousness in denying our rightful claim and subsequent inability to fulfill their obligations demonstrates a disturbing level of unprofessionalism and an alarming lack of transparency. Traveling should be an enjoyable and stress-free experience, yet Wizz Air has turned it into a nightmare. Their cancellation without reason, broken promises, and refusal to reimburse the amount we paid for an alternative flight have left us feeling betrayed and disillusioned. It is my sincere hope that this review will serve as a cautionary tale to potential passengers considering Wizz Air, urging them to explore alternative options and spare themselves the agony we endured. In conclusion, I strongly advise against choosing Wizz Air for your travel needs. Their lack of accountability, unreliable service, and poor customer care make them an airline that should be avoided at all costs.

? Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,TeAviv to Larnaca,23-Jun,2,4,,,,2,2,no,3,"  I think it's misleading to call this a low-fare. It was nothing but. The first indication of a campy ticket was when booking the tickets for two families I added one large (20kg) suitcase to each family. to my surprise, the cost of adding the luggage was per leg and stood at a whopping $130 per leg, per suitcase. In total, I paid $270 for the suitcase. For comparison, the ticket was $162. Additionally, the advertised ticket price changed while I was in the middle of the booking process and jumped by $20 per passenger. So a projected $140 ticket (already pricey for a 37min. flight!) actually climbed to $252 (in a family of 3). This didn't include advanced check in cost, seat selection cost, and other money grabbing options. But the real shocker was upon return. We got to the ticket counter and expected to drop our luggage and get our boarding passes when we were informed unceremoniously that we needed to pay another 50 Euro per person to be checked in. This happened despite the fact that no such fees were asked for on the way from TLV to Larnaca. The ground team threatened to deny our boarding unless we paid. The confirmation email btw only mentioned that ""If possible, always check in online before leaving for the airport. Otherwise, you might have to pay a fee at the airport."" - no clear language there whatsoever. Nothing in red, no advanced warning via email or sms. only an automated response from the check in rep. The supervisor wasn't offering any help either. We had to run to the other side of the terminal, pay the fees, then run all the way to the gate (threatened with a closed gate) only to be left waiting for the bus to the plane another 20 minutes in a small hall with no AC. Finally, a 20min. delay while on the plane is almost always complementary. The final ticket price then jumped to a little over $300, a truly low-low-fare experience for the price of a full-fare flight. I'd say that unless you're traveling alone, with a small backpack, and have all the time in the world, avoid this company at all cost.",negative,-0.635642,0,19,8.531707,5.905089

We had to pay €45 each, €90 in total, but although this is a significant expense for us, the displeasure was the treatment received by the employees, they spoke to us and treated us without respect and laughing.

Useless delays, total disrespect of the passengers, constant overbooking/oversold tickets, no time for actually hygiene in the aircraft. An air pirate of the same type as Ryan Air.

Ok, it's bad having your flight delayed but I gave them the benefit of the doubt since this happens to a lot of airlines. We looked up the aircraft info to find that there was no previous flight. As we waited at the airport we had 5 or 6 different times given to us by Wizz. Once the gate finally opened we made our way. We sat on the ground since seating was not available. Once we were ok to board we were put onto a bus to go to the plane. Once we arrived the driver opened the doors, told us ""don't exit yet"" and so we were left on the bus (packed in very tightly, there are no seats) for 15-20 minutes as we watched the cabin crew cleaning the plane through the windows. Why drive us out if the aircraft is not ready? And the plane has not had a previous flight AND was delayed 2 hours, the plane should have been prepared already? Once we finally got off the bus we were met by what I would find out to be some of the rudest hosts on a plane I have ever met. Every 5 seconds over the PA ""please do not block the aisles to avoid further delays"" to me seemed a bit rich after our experience so far. Also people are boarding, we aren't going to be seated in 3 seconds? When we sat, the aircraft was in a disgustingly awful state. Crumbs are everywhere, rubbish was left in the seat pockets. This aircraft was sitting here at the airport for a long time and the crew had done an abysmal job at preparing for passengers. The flight itself, once we got into the air was ok. Nothing special (they like to push their 'duty free' items on you for purchase, however I found that I could buy most of this stuff at Tesco for half the price). We landed at Gatwick and this is where the true torture began. Passengers stood to collect their luggage. As we were departing, the host grabbed the PA, stared directly into passengers eyes with the most disgusting look I have ever seen from flight crew ""DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT"" this was met with passengers fuming, how are we meant to get our luggage down then? He repeated it as I walked towards the front door of the aircraft ""DO NOT BLOCK THE AISLE WHILE WE ALIGHT FROM THE AIRCRAFT"" he proceeded to put down the microphone then step in front of me, put his finger to my face and said ""WAIT"" passengers piled behind me after this man had just told us not to block the aisles. He put his finger down ""ok go"". Me and my partner were livid.

Now the long story: I specifically bought a return flight with Wizz Flex option, in total amount of 260 Eur (212 Eur the actual flight fare and the rest in fees). So I would expect (after reading the Terms & Conditions of Wizz Flex), in the eventuality of asking for refund, to be entitled to 212 Eur back. I postponed the flight once. During this process, the Wizz Air website shows you available dates and after you select the new dates, it computes the price for the new flight and shows you only if there is a difference in price in their favour (if you have to pay something extra or not). I did this, nothing extra to pay, all good here. Later it became clear I will not be able to travel at all, so I went for the second benefit of the Wizz Flex, cancelling and getting a full refund. Surprise: Wizz Air congratulates me for being eligible for a full refund: 40 Eur! At this point I spend more money to call them (the only way to contact is by phone, charge with 1.2 Eur per min), to find out that when I postponed the flight, my refund value was automatically changed to the value of the flight from those new dates. A value which was not even displayed to me during this process. Again, during flight change, Wizz Air computes the value of the new flight and only shows you if you have to pay more for the new dates. It purposely does not warn you that not only you don't have to pay more, but that you are exchanging tickets worth 260 Eur to tickets worth 40 Eur and that this will affect your refund value too. Besides this practice being so obviously mean to trick you, is this even legal? To make a parallel, it is not legal to run an online shop that shows products you can buy, to charge your customers and to not show them the price they will be charged with. Even if you add this to your Terms & Conditions, that the client must do whatever they can to figure out the price and that you're free to charge whatever you like, it is not legal to do so.",positive,0.433229,1,18,8.267629,-6.284321

I was travelling with a friend who became injured during our trip and needed accessibility assistance; the crew member failed to communicate how she would be supported upon landing to get off the aircraft, and became very rude and impatient in her responses, when we asked legitimate questions after landing. We waited until all passengers had left the aircraft, and only then approached them to find out what was going on but we were just sharply told to ¡°Wait!¡± without any clarification about what help will be offered. It is disgusting that they would treat a vulnerable customer with so much disrespect, and do so little to reassure them. We have been contacting them for months since our initial booking, but have not had any response or any positive action taken to resolve matters via email and through their contact form online. It is almost impossible to get hold of them. They simply don't care, and just want people's money. It seems it is not only their customers they treat so poorly since I spoke to a crew member on the flight, who also moaned that they have received many complaints and even as a staff member, she wasn¡¯t even offered a flight with them to visit her family members who were unwell or easily given time off. It¡¯s clear they are stone cold as a company, and care about nothing but profits. There are so many negative and worrying articles about them in the media. Still, they don¡¯t act on customer complaints in a timely manner. I rarely waste my time and energy on writing bad reviews, but Wizz Air have been so poor with their customer service and strike me as a very unethical company given the countless bad reviews and comments I see online everywhere, that I feel compelled to write my experience also. I would not even give them a single Star but unfortunately you have to click on one to post a review!! I am fuming and will never be using this airline again.

Not even for buying the ticket, not for cancelling the tickets, not for calling and asking for a receipt, not for writing to them to complain. Why is this? We had two return tickets bought directly through Wizz Air. They moved the return home time forward 12 hours, which is why we contacted them to cancel the tickets. They stated that they could and I asked thoroughly if we got all the money back, which was confirmed several times. Time passed and we heard nothing, we call again for a refund. They stated again that the money was on its way. On the 3rd call, which was 3 days before departure, they suddenly told us, that we could not get the money back! They had since the first call cancelled and deleted our tickets from our Wizz Air page, so now we were without money and tickets. The complaint has been sent, but now over one month later we haven't heard anything. Unfortunately, we only read the many reviews afterwards.

They first ask for a screenshot of the technical mistake, you show it to them and then they say: ""You should have called our Call centre - it\s your fault.""

Information provided was minimal and conflicting with the text messages we received. The plane that ended up taking us to Stockholm had been standing on the ground in BUD since 1am that night, so why we were delayed in the first place remains a mystery. Beyond the delay, another reason for me never to use Wizz again is their appalling additional charges. If you think Ryanair and EasyJet are bad, just consider the fact that Wizz makes you pay for sitting together with your travel companions on the same booking. A romantic trip for two? Don¡¯t take Wizz, because you¡¯ll end up spending your flight time on opposite ends of the plane unless you pay. Absolutely disgusting, never flying this horrid airline again.

As I didn¡¯t find any available direct flights to Tenerife by the time of booking the tickets in April 2022. First, I booked a flight for 4 passengers from Bergen to Gdansk  with WizzAi, which is canceled by Wizzair after the planned departure time). I have booked one night in a hotel in Gdansk on 25/06/2022. Bought 4 tickets for the whole family with LOT Airlines from Gdansk to Warsaw in order to take another aircraft to Tenerife. Booked another 4 tickets from Warsaw to Tenerife through Wizz Air at the end. On the planned day we went to Bergen Airport. The departure time was at 14.05. We received a sms from Wizz Air  the flight is delayed and the estimated departure will be: 14.40, then another sms at 14.27 that the flight was delayed again and the new departure will be at 16.00, then another sms about a new delay to 16.30. At 14.47 they sent sms that the flight was canceled without mentioning the reason for cancellation. No one from WizzAir was in the airport to inform us what to do and no one called us. We went home with our kids again and tried to contact Wizz Air. After 45 minutes waiting over the phone with a paid phone call, they said that there are no other available flights, and we must send them a claim form to get a refund. I tried on my own to find another solution, and I found a flight at 22.40 to travel to another city in Poland (Katowice) where I could rent a car and drive 4 hours to Warsaw in order to catch the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife on the second day. I called them again to rebook this flight, and they assured me that everything is OK. I got the same confirmation number, I rented a car and paid online from Katowice Airport to drive with my family over the night to Warsaw as we did not find a hotel to accommodate us. We went to Bergen Airport again with our kids. The new boarding was at 22.40 on Saturday 25/06/2022, but they told us that the flight was delayed and then was also canceled without giving any reason. No one from Wizz Air was in the airport, the same as for the first time. Just those from Bergen airport gave us a paper stating our rights and they said that Wizzair will contact us, but no one has contacted us. I called WizzAir again. They couldn't find any other alternative flights, and asked me to send them a claim to get a refund and any other expense that I lost due to the two cancellations. I received a SMS at 06.00 am that the flight was canceled. (7 hours after the scheduled departure time). As a result of that , we could not travel to Poland and we missed the hotel accommodation, the flight from Gdansk to Warsaw, the car rental fee in Katowice and on top of that we missed the flight from Warsaw to Tenerife. I searched again and again and I found another route with another airline and of course the price was doubled. The original price was around 9000 Norwegian krone.

Anyway, all that aside, we were on our merry way. On both flights the luggage check in queue was enormous. We arrived 3 hours before our flight which was not international and were almost late because of the queue. We only queued to tag our pram as we were travelling light, but there was no one to ask and it was not clear on the site. Both flights there was only one staff member for premium and one staff member for economy so either way the queue was ridiculous. Fine, we thought we had the time as Wizz Air (on both trips) had texted to say the flight was delayed. However none of the airport gate signs indicated the flight was delayed so after rushing through, skipping any sort of food with a baby we made it to the gate to leave. The airport sign actually said 'gate closing' but when we arrived there was just a lot of people sitting on the floor wondering what was going on. Eventually after about an hour an announcement that the cabin crew were in the airport was made, but no indication of how long was given. On our outbound flight we waited for an hour and half and ransacked the vending machine to feed our family and on the return flight we must have waited over 2 hours, again in a waiting area with very little seating, I had to stand for almost 2 hours with a 2 year old whilst being almost 7 months pregnant.

My party and I are very disappointed with Wizz Air. We had just flown into Milan from New York and we were connecting to Cagliari, Sardinia in April 2022. We were sure to have our bags the allotted and accepted sizes. When we went to the Check-in Desk, the woman at the check-in in Milan said that we needed to purchase our boarding passes. She further stated that two of our bags were not compliant when indeed there were others identical that went through without being charged an extra hundred dollars. The folks traveling with us are 80 years old, one with a cane, and this woman showed no compassion. Because my phone was in airplane mode on the flight right before this, I was unable to check in within 3 hours prior to this flight. I had my tickets and barcode on my phone. She gave us two little pieces of paper and we had to go to this kiosk and wait 15 minutes in line to purchase two more boarding passes. We had purchased these tickets through e-Dreams where each time I purchased a ticket, the price went up. I paid an extra $125 for two more boarding passes. I was about to pay for my personal ticket but then I thought, I am going to go straight to the line and not go through that woman because I have my ticket. That worked for me, but the elderly couple were extremely distraught and upset over this experience. I ended up ordering two new tickets for them for the return trip. I double-ordered because I did not want to get saddled with another boarding pass fee. I did not use e-Dreams either this time and that helped. I contacted Customer Support a I do not like to write negative reviews, but they kept giving me the run-around. Incidentally, we got through with our bags on the return trip as we refused to go to the check-in desk and our bags were fine sidewise.

We traveled from Vienna to Barcelona as a group of 5 people. Firstly we were not able to proceed with an online check in as there was only 2 seats available. What surprised us first at the airport was extremely arrogant staff. Secondly, we were asked to pay an additional 40Eur per person for check in at the airport, in spite of the mistake from the Wizz Air side. Lady at the check in counter rudely told us that we only have 2 options: Pay 40Eur per person or stay in Vienna. After paying 200Eur we came to check in counter and the lady informed us that only 3 people can fly, for the other 2 they didn't have seats as the flight was overbooked. Again rude with very bad attitude. She literally threw on us 2 boarding passes without seats mentioning that we can go and fight at the boarding counter. Boarding crew was nothing better but luckily (we don't know how) we got a seat. In spite of having Wizz Priority we had to wait until the last person boarded, not knowing if we were flying or not. Another disappointment was the very messy and dirty aircraft.

These passengers could decide not to travel or follow up the missing bags later. We then boarded to be held on the ground for 2 hours while they attempted to resolve what transpired to me a wildcat strike by ground staff. The announcements from the cockpit were few and far between and refused to take any responsibility for the situation or suggest any attempts to mitigate it. The cabin crew did not nothing to police mask wearing among the passengers, with people sneezing and coughing all over the cabin while not wearing masks. Indeed, the crew were rather casual in mask wearing themselves, with the purser frequently pulling hers down. We eventually left and arrived two hours late.

So the fee you see is just to get you through the door - any bag larger than a shoe box you pay for - check in at the airport ?35 per person. Seats - The price you see is for a ticket. I am yet to find a way to book without being charged ?20 on top for a seat. Regardless of whether I choose the seats or allow them to. If there is a way, it¡¯s hidden or not obvious. Inflight - Usual small selection of expensive snacks - anything goes wrong expect to be quoted terms and conditions stating they can¡¯t help and you should have known this. Refunds - if you actually manage to get one it is to a Wizz Air account to use with Wizz Air. So not actually a refund at all. It cost me €70+ euros for checking in 2 people at the airport which I was forced to do as their app is unreliable. It always seems to crash when trying to use it to check in so you need to check in from a computer. I was one of many dozen at the airport on both recent occasions when I travelled with the same issue and same huge additional bill to pay before we could travel. They don¡¯t care, they say pay or don¡¯t travel and lose all the money as our refund policy prevents you refunding under such circumstances unless you bay x 10 for a flexible refundable ticket.

Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Warsaw to Bergamo,21-Oct,2,3,2,,,1,2,no,2,"  There is a new model of airline that desperately wants to undercut the prices of other airlines to get your business, and that is Wizz Air. They present a low priced ticket to snipe your attention and your money, then once you¡¯ve committed your purchase, they add on all of the extras. Do you  want to sit with your young child? They¡¯ll charge you for that. Do you want to carry a bag with you larger than a computer case? They¡¯ll charge you for that. Did you want to check in for your flight somehow? They¡¯ll charge you for that (they even charge for online check in). You get a cheap price up front until they secure your business, but once they have it, the stack on the extra fees until your ticket price becomes comparable to an actual reputable airline. You will not be able to fly without paying extra fees. Because I didn¡¯t check in online the day before (because you know, I have things to do before I go on vacation) they charged me an extra $150 dollars just to do a regular check in. Then, because I had a cabin-sized bag and a camera bag, they charged me an extra $25 for that. Then because I didn¡¯t pay for assigned seats they actually sat my four year old child away from us. They had it on record that he was four years old and their seating arrangement came up with that! Can you believe it? Sure we could switch it around so he wasn¡¯t unaccompanied, but they were perfectly fine with separating the child from his family because a fee wasn¡¯t paid. That¡¯s a pretty gross business practice and I almost wonder if it was intentional because a fee wasn¡¯t paid. For real. This becomes a moral and ethical issue when they will make a child sit alone unless you pay an extra fee for seating. It¡¯s actually a disgusting business model and I will never fly this deceptive airline again. Just pay the extra money for a more reputable airline instead of this sneaky nonsense that Wizz Air pulls on its clients. So what is Wizz Air prioritizing? Cheap shot fees over customer service and satisfaction. DO NOT book this airline because it looks like a deal. It is not a good deal. They will loot you in one way or another by the time you get on that plane, and if you don¡¯t pay the extra fees, they¡¯ll show you why you better pay them in advance next time. Go with a more reputable airline that doesn¡¯t hide fees and carry on such underhanded business. Somewhere a board of directors is congratulating itself for this business model.

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Budapest to Reykjavik,21-Sep,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," I had an extremely negative experience with Wizz Air yesterday while attempting to fly to Reykjavik. First, I received my boarding pass on my phone prior to arrival at the airport and didn't need to check any baggage, so I went straight through security and into the airport. Budapest airport doesn't announce the gate for your flight until about 30 minutes prior to check-in closing, so I waited around for a while. Finally, my gate information appears and I went straight to my gate to check in (almost the first one in line). Right away, I am asked for my covid documentation which I have in the form of the EU Digital CovidPass, which is accepted in Iceland and is what I obtained especially for this trip (I'm am American citizen and was fully vaccinated in America, which makes this a lengthy process). The girl at check in says that it is not sufficient and I will also need a negative covid test to travel. First of all! I checked the travel restrictions for Iceland several times prior to my journey and read in numerous places that a test was not necessary. ""Can you visit Iceland? Yes. All travelers ¨C regardless of origin ¨C are welcome to visit Iceland if they can show either a certificate of full vaccination against COVID, or a certificate of previous COVID infection."" - Icelandair I assume, therefore, that with my EU residence permit and EU Digital CovidPass, that I would be OK for travel. Second of all, neither that service that I booked through (Kiwi) or my airline (Wizz) provided any information about what documents I would need until the second I arrived at the gate, only 30 minutes before the closing of check-in. Finally, almost everyone who I interacted with was rude, and completely uninterested in helping me find a solution. I could have received a rapid test at Budapest airport in time, or there is a perfectly valid option to receive a test in Iceland and quarantine until the results return. No matter the suggestion I made, the Wizz Air authorities were disrespectful and adamant that I do not board the plane. And I believe its also relevant to add that I'm a 19 year old solo female traveler, for which the thought of missing my flight and being stranded in a foreign country is not particularly pleasant, however I was met with no sympathy from anyone during this experience.

Many of the passengers on the flight were either not wearing masks at all, or wearing them in such a way that it was neither covering their mouth nor their nose. I initially kindly asked some of the infringing passengers to properly wear the mask, to which they first ignored me and then they started making insulting comments towards me in Romanian (I speak the language so I understood what they said). When I raised this issue with members of the crew, they shrugged me off and told me that there is nothing they can do about it and that I should sort this issue. I do not believe that it is the job of passengers to enforce basic covid safety rules, and I also believe that the airline has a duty of care towards all its passengers. The incident made me feel very uncomfortable and unsafe during the entire duration of the flight. Moreover, I noticed that during the entire duration of the flight, no member of the flight crew took any measure or said anything towards other rule infringing passengers, not even when passengers without masks were passing by them on the corridor. I find this to be unacceptable, for a member of the flight crew to pass multiple infringing passengers on the corridor and not do even as much as ask them to follow international guidelines and regulations regarding safety during the Covid Pandemic.

No, it is not just for your preferred seats, but irrespective of which seats you select and occasionally you can't even do that. Note that the Wizz Air online check-in closes 3 hours before departure! 2) To not pay for the check-in, according to the Wizz Air website, is possible at the airport by using the self-service check-in, and if those are not available at the traditional check-in desk. 3) However, this is not the case. At Milan Malpensa Terminal 1 on Friday, and at Vienna Terminal 3 on Sunday (today), there was no self-service check-in available (I confirmed this with the available check-in staff), and the traditional check-in counter would only check us in if we paid €15/person. 4) This is not all, at MXP the payment is handled by another desk which charges a €5/person commission and at VIE the commission is €5/transaction. So when you book with Wizz Air you need on paying at least €7-8 for the check-in online, or €15 if you do so at the airport plus €5 commission. This is not an optional extra service!

However my partner could check-in online without problems although I was the one with the so called ""priority"" status. Because of that I ended up with center seats on both sectors. I have to mention that check-in on both airports was smooth and done within 2 minutes. I also have to say that for short flights the Wizz Airseat configuration is acceptable but definitely not what you would get on premium airlines (230 instead of 200 allows an idea how tight everything is). The crew was nice and seemed to be motivated and drinks from the onboard bistro service were sold at reasonable prices. Both flights landed ahead of time and WIZZ managed the new COVID procedures very well and distributed the necessery health declarations during boarding. Would I recommend WIZZ for short flights?

The Greek Government  said that direct flights from the UK to Greece would continue to not be permitted from 1 July (they were not permitted during June, and they were thinking of allowing them from 1st July onwards, but changed their minds, and first announced that on 26th June). He also said that the official announcement was going to come out on 29th June. I didn't want to wait till 1 day before my flight for WizzAir to cancel it (and I found out from others that they ended up cancelling it on the 30th and a mere 14 hours before the actual flight), thus I tried to book another flight. In that effort, I ended up cancelling my ticket which led to the first ridiculous policy they have - it takes 72 hours for them to put the ""refunded"" money into a ""Wizz Air account"", why 72 hours? The second ridiculous policy is that after they added it I would only have 3 months to book another flight with them, otherwise they keep the money, which is ridiculously short even for pre-COVID times, it should be 12 months at least, and probably 24 or 36 now that COVID is around. I would have found that reasonable. But regardless, I couldn't wait 72 hours to book another flight with them, so I ended up booking with another company for my actual flight. Once the 72 hours passed, my money was added to the ""Wizz Air Account"", after which I proceeded to try to get a refund to one of my actual bank accounts. In that process, they ask for the reason for the refund, and they have two new options ""Cancellation initiated by Wizz Air due to COVID"" and ""Cancellation initiated by customer due to COVID"" - I picked the second option, assuming that there is a difference from a similar cancellation pre-COVID times, and thus that I would actually get a refund (otherwise what's the point of having such an option). Apparently, cancelling my flight due to COVID (a flight which was gonna get cancelled for sure by them eventually) and having bought the more expensive ticket wasn't enough to get a refund.

They basically told me to go away and accept 25% refund or nothing!! They argued the remaining 3 flights were available and it was up to us to turn up for them even though it was impossible to do so. We then booked 4 flights for later in the year, when we got conformation they had charged for extra luggage we didn't want, we contacted them immediately AND before the transaction was complete , the money was still in our account, Guess what! Our fault we`re taking the money make a complaint! Then we notice that one of the ticket had the my christian name on it not my wifes. We immediately contacted them, Guess what!!!! You`re fault pay 45 euros or lose the flight!! Wizz Air have definitely changed their customer care from good to tell everyone to go away! We understand it is difficult for airlines at this moment but brutal and rude response to genuine enquiries is not the way to treat long standing honest and decent clients.

This agent proceeded to advise me that Wizz Air cannot be held responsible for a colleagues error which is an absolute ridiculous & totally unacceptable statement to be made. Without the refund as promised by Wizz Air our holiday is now in jeopardy in addition we stand to lose our deposit for the accommodation which was booked independently from Wizz Air as we now have only until 18/06/20 to confirm that we still want the accommodation.

? Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,,20-Feb,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I bought return tickets for my entire family (5 persons, one of which 3 years old) for the above mentioned flights in October 2019. The flight was scheduled for 19 May 2020. Given the worldwide pandemic crisis, lockdown restrictions were set in place by the government of Romania and UK. As such, I called WizzAir customer service at the beginning of April 2020 to enquire about the flight status. I was advised that the flight was still going ahead as planned and that passengers will be informed about cancellations due to Covid19 via email (when applicable). When I asked about the notice period I was informed there is not a set notice period and it could vary from 2 weeks to next-day cancellation notice. WizzAir personnel advised me not to cancel my booking as yet and wait for further communication closer to the flight date, and that if I still wanted to cancel the flights due to the Covid19 pandemic and further restrictions inposed by government then I should do so 14 days prior to flight date to ensure I am not charged additional cancellation fees. I called customer service again on the 1st of May 2020 and I was advised the flight is still going ahead as scheduled and if I wanted to cancel the flights WizzAir will charge 60 Euros/person/flight. This is unacceptable considering the current worldwide situation, and more specifically the restrictions imposed by the government. The UK is under lockdown with no end date in sight (at the point of this complaint), which means all non-essential travel is not permitted. Additionally, social distancing restrictions are further imposed by the Romanian Government and the UK government, including 2 meters distance between people. These measures were not respected. As such, the flight should have been cancelled, in line with government guidelines. It is not acceptable for a company not to adhere to Government guidelines and put customers at risk. I find it appalling that flights are not cancelled in advance by WizzAir (given specific lockdown instructions set by the government) and that passengers are required to cancel the flights more than 14 days prior to the flight so that the cancellation fees are not increased. It is absurd to charge the cancellation fee per person per flight and not per booking, meaning that the customer receives a 10th of the price paid. Based on the information I received from the WizzAir staff, the flight cancellation period varies from 2 weeks to 1 day. This means WizzAir deliberately does not adhere to WHO and Government (country specific) guidelines and restrictions, so that they can retain most of the price paid by customers when booking flights. Aside from this blatant disregard for pandemic restrictions, the customer service personnel was rude and dismissive over the phone, with no willingness to discuss the options available for customers. When I was given the information relating to the cost of cancellation, the call handler was abrupt and repeatedly asked me ""Should I cancel this or not?"" without allowing me the time to process the information received and to calculate/ understand how much will all this cost.",negative,-0.827218,1,17,6.605298,-6.357842

Unfortunately, I see myself forced to write a negative review for my first and only experience with Wizz Air. If you are a traveller or enjoy visiting new cities please take 2 mins to read this: I had a flight from Berlin to Budapest on 6.12.2019, it was overbooked so I was denied boarding. I contacted the airlines in the next day and until today I didn¡¯t receive the compensation as per the EU regulations. I was accused of not showing up at the counter to take the denied boarding form. This is not true because I showed up in the counter and was given back the check-in money in cash. In addition, I was granted a one night stay at the airport¡¯s hotel and the officers clarified to me to claim the compensation online. So how can I not show up in the counter and take these? I understand that an overbooked flight can just happen but what is not accepted is to spend 40+ days sending several emails to get the compensation. At the moment I am not sure if this review will move something yet I think that when someone reads this will definitely think twice before booking with Wizzair.

Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sofia to Luton,20-Feb,1,4,1,1,1,2,2,no,2,"  Wizz Air never seems to stop surprising with its tendency of maximising their profit and reducing their service quality at the same time. This time we flew from Luton to Sofia  and back. And despite doing everything in the same way as before each time I failed to have all my family sitting together when opting for the automatically allocated seats. And I¡¯m not talking about being split by isle or next row but 5-6 rows apart. So now the only way to have all of us sit together is by paying a premium of 17 Euros per person each way which adds nearly 140€ to our already high fares (half term craze)! I could be listing all minor issues with Wizzair for hours but another major one is the ridiculously low luggage allowance they call ¡°free on-board baggage¡± which really only allows you to have a small backpack or ladies purse. The only way around it is guess what (?) paying around ?50 extra to have a 20kg checked-in bag or purchase priority service which then gives you the same allowance you¡¯d get with every other airline in the world. Finally just to show how bad their service is, when we were being transferred back to Sofia airport and been asked which terminal we¡¯d be flying from, there was no way of getting this information from neither the Wizzair emails, their ticket or even their website. Instead we had to google it and verify from a 3rd party website which is just a joke!

If the policy is to allow bigger bags fair enough but what is really unfair is my bag was only slightly bigger than the allowed size, so why did others not have to pay for bigger and I did?

Their number is really hard to find but I called and was told I would be transferred, I was put on hold for 20 minutes and then they cut me off.

Wizz Air sent useful SMS the day prior to the flight home advising of possible air-traffic delays (which did not materialise).

This seat however does not have a window and I bumped into the person next to me several times due to the insufficient seat width. The cabin crew were very friendly and welcoming throughout the flight. There was a good selection of food and beverages available onboard and they were reasonably priced. When I arrived at the gate for this flight we were informed that the flight was delayed but unfortunately no passenger announcement was made to explain why. When I asked the employee at the gate they told me that the expected delay would be an hour. An hour later, we were told that our flight would depart from a different gate and we made our way to the alternate gate. We then waited another hour with no announcements made before the boarding process commenced and we were able to get on the buses. It was only once we had boarded our aircraft that we were told that the delay had been caused by a maintenance issue and that the pilot's windscreen had now been repaired. I understand that safety is paramount but I was still frustrated by the lack of information on the ground. If we were given a more accurate delay time and and actual reason for the delay back at the gate I would have been content. We finally departed 2.5 hours after our estimated time of departure. Also, the boarding process was hectic and the ground staff should have been more clear regarding priority boarding. The announcements that they did make were unintelligible and could not be heard.

We were super relieved, but soon she came back and said that actually because we didn't call their call center about the issue we should pay also check in fees and the bag.

The baggage was measured many times, there was no problem when she was flying from Poznan to Eindhoven. Length, width, depth and weight was in the permitted limit. Although my girlfriend did not fly and was forced to exit the terminal.

You only get priority when boarding the bus and at the gate, when they do the check-in, not when boarding the aeroplane like one may think. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful, the outbound flight was extremely smooth, no turbulences at all, the returning one had a few moments where it was slightly shaky. Yet, it was all good. The online check-in process was very easy. Be aware that if you do not check-in online, you pay a fee for the airport check-in. As for the luggage again, they even let this woman with a bag that clearly exceeded their dimensions limit in the cabin. Maybe she got lucky. Overall, I would fly Wizz again and I will in December, the same route. Absolutely love it. No ¡°hidden¡± or ¡°extra¡± fees as long as you read their rules carefully.

We arrived to check in to see a mass of people not in structured queues as there were more than double the amount of people for the standard queue barricades they had set up. It was a funnel effect of a large mass of people trying to jam in to one small entry line with no direction from surrounding staff who were simply standing there. Nobody was taking initiative. I asked a staff member where exactly we should be queuing for our flight and she directed us to 3 counters further down. We waited in the queue for half an hour. Then a different staff member asked if I was priority. I said no. She said I need to move to the next line. Turns out two lines are standard and one is priority however we weren¡¯t told that and the priority line was written in small writing at the front counter at the bottom of the screen. After this staff member turned several people to the correct queue I suggested to her she could go through the very large line and check with people before they spend half hour in the line only to get to her and be told it¡¯s the wrong line. She did this and subsequently 80% of the line had to move as they were also told the wrong thing. There were a lot of angry people. We then queued for another half hour in the right line only to get to the counter and the boy behind the counter to say he could not check me in. Because I hadn¡¯t checked in online. When in actual fact my partner who booked my ticket with his on the same booking could not book me in online. He tried several times but the website seemed to not allow it. This was an IT issue not our fault however we were being penalised by being made to now pay for a ticket to be issued. We were sent to a different desk. The guy changed some things in the system. He said due to booking through an external booking provider it causes glitches in the system and I was not in my partners booking despite having a confirmation email and having paid for my ticket. He said next time to book direct. If external booking systems don¡¯t work, then don¡¯t allow people to buy a ticket through them?!we then had to go back to the same counter, explain to other customers why we were pushing in and then explain to the original boy that we were permitted to continue. Of which he questioned.we then only just make it to boarding and stand inline for 20 mins before another staff member who had been looking at everyone¡¯s bags pulled me aside to say my carry on was too big. He waited til almost everyone had boarded before pulling a select few aside to charge for bags. Mine was literally 5cm over the bar: after 20 something flights this is the first time I have been stopped.my bag fit under the seat!!!

Every flight I have taken has been delayed to some extent: the shortest delay I can recall was of 20 minutes; the longest was of about 2.5 hours. My flight on 2nd July was delayed by 1.5 hours. Wizz Air has used a variety of excuses when apologising in the aircraft for the delay in taking-off and arrival so it's not even worth repeating them. There is no point passengers and potential passengers trying to identify the reasons why this company seems incapable of taking-off and landing at the correct time, particularly on certain routes and particularly from Luton. The cabin crew on all my flights have been polite and professional but they too have seemed jaded and worn-down by the lack of on-time performance; after all, a flight that lands at 2.30am (instead of at the scheduled midnight) means a very late arrival home for the crew as well. The standard crew comment that ""this is aviation and you have to expect such things"" is now becoming the company's mantra. I don't care that Wizz Air charges for all types of luggage after the first small personal item; I don't care that I have to pay for seat selection as well as for food and drink; nor do I care much about the cleanliness of the exterior and interior of the aircraft. At the end of the day, I want what most people want: I want to arrive at my destination safely and at the time shown on the timetable.

The problem with this is that you may get priority check in to the departure lounge (i.e. before the rest of the passengers) but not the plane, for which there is an absolute free for all, including fights for luggage space.

I have to say that if these policies are so important, then the airline should put this on the front page of their website.

Even though when we tried to do this on a laptop, phone and on different browsers and site still was not working. When I went for help to Tirana Airport they charged us €35 euros each for check in and €20 for a carry on which was within allowance (and the same carry on we had from Luton to Tirana (only one piece as we went away for less than 48 hrs)). On the same flight, half of the passengers who had to board had the same problem as us because the website was not working. As they did not want to miss their flight they were obliged to pay. As soon as we landed I complained to Wizzair online. Next day, I received a reply just copying and pasting their terms and conditions. They did not even bother to investigate this matter, no apologies no nothing. Also no refund she wrote. I replied back saying that I do not want copying and pasting paragraphs, I want a reply from the highest manager as her email was not addressing all my points and she showed no remorse. I received a second reply next day and again it was from her (they seem to not have a manager at all). At the end she wrote the following: "" I would like to inform you that Wizz Air has exhausted its internal complaint handling process"" which shows that I should not bother them anymore and as she mentioned in her previous email again ""no refund"". This airline makes sure that the online check in does not work all the time so they can cheat the passengers at the airport.

While I have nothing special to say about the onboard staff (they were neither nice nor rude, almost non-existent, I would say), I was appalled about the attitude of the Wizzair staff at the airport. First of all, the boarding gate did not appear on the display for long time (even though we were very close to the departure time). When it finally did, the number was accompanied already by a flashing ""BOARDING"" sign which put pressure on us. The gate was A17 so we followed the signs and at one point the signs indicated a direction for gates A12 - A19. Here it's when I noticed, on the side, a Wizzair staff screaming something which I could not understand so I went to her asking what is that she was saying and she was extremely rude and basically shoved us (not indicated) to another Wizzair staff (would have not been easier to put a sign akin to ""A12 to A19 except Wizzair passengers"" rather than having that rude woman screaming?"". So we went to this other person, this time a man who was checking the boarding passes and the size of the backbags without ever lifting his head and with the utmost scary expression. He sent me on one queue while my friends to another. When I asked him why, even though we were on the same flight, he sent us on two different queues, his brusque reply was: ""There is a difference, just go"". Is this a normal reply to someone who is asking you something? To a customer? I fully understood that it deeply bothers them when someone ask them a question, silly or clever that it may be, they just don't want question. I wonder why they chose this job and why there are allowed to treat people this way.

When I called and I explained once more the issue, I was told that my case would be escalated to a senior department and I will hear back in 4-6 weeks. 3 months have passed with no reply, so I contact them again to check the process of my complaint. Guess what reply I get? A copy-paste robotic request of my PIR form. I am exasperated with their handling of my case both at the airport, online and over the phone, so far this has cost me ?22 for checked-in baggage fees + ?100 for a new suitcase as I was travelling again a week later + ?20 on the phone bill for calling their expensive customer service line!",negative,-0.797846,0,15,7.748934,4.820282

Myself and another medically trained passenger took over. We had to wait for airport medics and there were no blankets on board to keep him warm. We did get him more comfortable, calmed the relatives and gave vital information to medics once they arrived. I would suggest the medical policy is reviewed to ensure blankets are available when needed and more medical kit is allowed to be used.

Two hours after landing there, we were told that we were being returned to Luton and there was no other option. There was no reason for this redirection all that way except that the airline knew they needed the plane in the morning for other flights, and lied to the passengers about the reason.

My flight was cancelled and each passenger had to rebook him/herself the flight for another, already existing one, for which there are any free seats left. This means, some passengers may get to the desired destination in a couple of days, which is ridiculous! Also, for the time until the new flight, the passengers are not offered a full compensation for the accommodation expenses that occurred. In case WIZZ AIR is unable to perform the cancelled flight due to their lack of spare machines and makes people look for which flight there are any free seats left (limitation of their aircraft and service), they should take over all days the passengers are forced to book a hotel for!

We have been charged additional 35 euros per passenger, at the airport because we didn't check in online. When you book the ticket (and I have booked so many times flight tickets with different companies), there is not any message saying that the self check in online is mandatory. The way of wording for the online check in, is similar to the rest companies as usual saying that :the online check is available two or some days before the flight and if you like you can check in online by yourself to avoid the waiting time at the airport, but nowhere is clearly stating that you must check in by yourself. This is too obvious, that the company is just trying to find ways to earn additional money. It would be way better, to just increase your fares and include the implicit services within the fare. This is the most ridiculous charge I have ever paid to an air company. Other than that, we have been advised that our cabin luggage couldn't been carried onboard the plane to the normal cabin storage place, because we didn't book our ticket with priority boarding and there should be an extra charge if we wanted to take our luggage with us. We have added two 10kg cabin bags along with our tickets, but we couldn't carry them with us because we didn't have priority boarding! Seriously?

? Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Warsaw to London,18-Oct,2,1,1,1,1,4,2,no,2," Today, I had THE worst experience of my life on Wizz Air. I arrived early for boarding so that I could find room for my backpack in the overhead compartment - which I did. I then took my row 'C' aisle seat. After boarding was completed, I was made to remove my backpack by the stewardess and force it under the seat in front of me. My backpack is large, flexible and within Wizz Air's size limits, but placing it there meant that there was no room left for my feet. (See photos). I could not place my feet outside in the corridor area, either as it would have tripped other passengers who were walking and blocked the food trolleys. I had no choice but to place my feet under the metal braces in the seat in front, meaning that every time the passenger in front moved in his seat, my foot would get crushed. By the end of the flight my foot was bruised, and I was in pain, simply because my bag was too large to fit under the seat, and it should have been left in the over head compartment. Upon pointing this to the stewardess who instigated this episode without any consideration of the consequences, she told me to write to Wizz Air and complain, and that there was nothing she could do. It may be that Wizz Air will read this and decide to reply, stating that shortly larger bags, such as the one which I had to remove mine for will not be allowed without an extra fee. However, that is not the point. At the time of my journey, this was allowed, and. Wizz Air provided zero safe foot space. My bag was also too large to fit under the seat in front, and should have stayed in the overhead locker. Additionally, as my bag was too large to fit the seat in front, it was blocking the emergency escape route of the passengers sitting in the window and middle rows. This is dangerous, and I believe against passenger air transport safety rules. There were also a couple of other, issues regarding hygiene. I noticed that the toilets were cleaned by cabin crew, without wearing gloves, using paper towels from inside of the toilets. First the seat was wiped, then the sink and finally the same towel was dropped on the floor and the floor was wiped using the shoes. The stewardess then pick up the papers from the floor using her hands and flushed them down the toilet. After this, and without washing her hand, she walked to the food trolley and started serving food to passengers, touching coffee cups, water bottles, serviettes and sandwich wrappers. This has to be the worst case of hygiene which I have ever come across, and I would not trust any food served on this airline. I also noticed that the headrests on the seats had grease marks on them, as the paper headrests were missing. The Velcro exists to hang the headrests from, but in order to save costs, it seems like Wizz Air have decided not to care about this item either. I have travelled on Wizz Air on numerous occasions in the last 10 years or so (about 10 times this year alone), however the service has reduced dramatically, the prices have any rocketed (they are often more expensive than national carrier National carriers) and the staff's attitude to customers is simply atrocious - possibly due to their fast expansion. Because of a staff members attitude, the poor and dirty hygiene, over crowding, and bad value for money, I will not travel on Wizz any more, and I recommend that you check the prices of other airlines before booking with Wizz Air.",negative,-0.721396,0,15,7.748934,4.820282

Wizz Air used to be a small airline with nice fares and helpful and friendly staff. They have recently expanded in a short period of time, and I believe this is where the problem lies. I have had 3 errors while making three different bookings in the last 2 months. I travel between university and home approximately every 2 months, and sometimes my family visit so you can imagine, there are a lot of bookings. No benefits whatsoever - no collecting airmiles, no benefits for frequent travellers. You have to buy a membership to get cheaper flights but nothing apart from that. The website is ridiculous. For example, last month (Sept 2018), I used my bank card for a booking and at the end of the transaction, I received an error notification that the bank card did not work and I was instructed to repeat my transaction again. A phone call came and I did not manage to try immediately. 2 minutes later, I receive an email with a summary of my booking because the transaction was actually complete! So luckily, I had not tried a second time. Another example (Sept 2018) is when I tried to add 2 suitcases to an inbound flight. But instead, they were added to the outbound flight!

I was first given a boarding pass with no problems when I arrived at Ljubljana airport and the boarding to the plane was about to start, as suddenly I was called to information situated outside the security. I was called to pay the 30€ because I had done the check-in at the airport (paper? The 2-second service?), and given no option to fight back because my flight was about to leave. I was treated like an idiot because I had not figured out that online check-in was needed while apparently having ""ticked the box"" to agree to do it online while booking. Apparently I would have figured this out by logging into their website. As if I had nothing better to do with my time than browsing their website just for fun. This was my first time with Wizz air and I had no idea this company had all these different ways to trick the customers. They probably make a fortune with the misleading check-in information.

Then, also before boarding, they labeled the cabin luggage randomly and by force: I told them that I want to take with me in the cabin and that it was very small luggage, below the maximum limits for cabin luggage. They didn't care and lied that it will not necessary go to drop off, the flight attendant will hold them only if there will be no more space in the cabin. It was a lie because we were among the first to board and they took the luggage to the drop off. The places for luggage in the cabin were almost empty near our seats, so it was only mockery what they did. Besides that we had to wait at 3:30am half an hour for the luggage. Another problem is that the space in the seat is too small. I have 1.7 meters height and I stood with my knees stuck in the front seat. I cannot imagine how taller persons can fly 3 hours in that tiny place. Conclusion: never, ever flight with this joke of company, they have the absolute worst service I ever experienced.

During that time we were on the plane for four hours, during which time a passenger deplaned for ""family"" reasons, an extensive security check was done on belongings in the plane, more passengers wanted to deplane (apparently scared by the extensive security check) and then everyone had to deplane. We were hardly instructed on where to go on the way back to the terminal, ""go up the stairs"", and given no prior instructions on how re-boarding was to take place. In the commotion, five passengers, including me were left stranded in Budapest. For Wizz Air, we were automatically to be blamed, and had to pay for a new ticket if we wanted to reschedule. Perhaps the smart passengers stayed standing in front of the departure screens, but I was told that the plane was expected to take off at 11 PM. After missing dinner and not drinking for hours, I needed to sit down and try to cancel my Madrid hostel reservation online. Then much earlier than expected I heard an announcement. That was the only boarding announcement although two authorized agents stated that ""many"" were given. It didn't look like any information was given on the screens. The five that took a few minutes more to respond to the announcement could not pass a barrier that was no longer successful in reading boarding passes. There were no agents around that could help. Looking everywhere we asked an orange-clad worker to find someone who after his second call on his cell phone told us we were lucky, that we just had to wait right there at that spot because the airline had to change the crew. But, alas, nobody came for us. Then, to add insult to injury, we were told we had to pay again to reschedule. The other four did that. I refused and tried making all contacts possible to ask them to reconsider. After all, I would have expected that would be the correct thing to do. At this point I have plenty of reason to believe that I will not get my money back, like many before me. If I do, it may only be because I paid with a credit card and my credit card company comes through to protect me. No way I would ever recommend this airline.

So you would thing I did everything right? How wrong was I! On arrival at the Wizz Air check in, the queue was several hundred passengers deep, I pointed out to an official that all we needed to do was check in 1 bag ""join the queue"" was the terse reply. 55 minutes later, we finally arrived at the check in to be told that our on line check in did not apply, and we had to go the whole procedure again. Wizz Air did not have have enough staff at the check in counters. While 12 desks were ""open"" only 6 were manned....absolutely pathetic service. The end result was a rush to the departure gate, only to find that everyone was ""herded"" into a departure lounge that had seating for less than 10% of passengers. Priority boarding passengers were lined up outside the terminal and had to wait in the hot sun (it was an unusually warm English day) while the delayed incoming aircraft was refueled, resulting in several having to force their way back through the queue to get some shade. Altogether a complete shambles. What about the flight I hear you say! The cabin crew were awesome, friendly and helpful.

So much for strict airline policy on drunken behaviour on planes. The return trip to Luton as a couple we were given separate seats, although there were spare seats available, obviously their object to get extra cash by expecting an additional payment for the privilege of sitting together, which after 63 years of marriage, on principal we would not do.

The seats are comfortable enough for a short-haul flight and I don't have a problem with legroom as I'm not very tall. The cabin crew was very friendly and courteous, as usual. What I don't like about them if that they make you check-in your hand luggage most of the time, if it's a trolley. Or they charge you for letting you take it on board. This is really annoying because you always have to wait for your hand luggage at the destination. This particular flight was quite bumpy. There's very little a pilot can do to avoid turbulent weather and I am not one to be easily scared, but this time the flight experience was a little unpleasant. No concerns over safety, though, so I will keep flying with them. The worst thing of all was the boarding experience at Otopeni airport (and the overall condition of the airport).

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vienna to Rome,18-Jul,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Vienna to Rome. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown on. Here are 3 reasons why: 1) They Charge you for everything. I mean everything. If you don¡¯t have checkin completed before you get to the airport it costs $40 to get one there so you can fly (not an exaggeration). Printing the little piece of paper costs literally as much as the airplane ticket. In addition, there website is so sneaky and tricky that they won¡¯t send an email asking you to confirm or anything. They will make it incredible you difficult to do so they can steal some more money. I had 5 different flights on this trip from several airlines and this was the only one I could not figure out how to check in and spend $40 on that. Also expect to get charged extra if you have any extra bags at all: purse, hand bag, etc. I wouldn¡¯t be surprised if you got charged for entering the plane with gum in your mouth. 2) Staff will treat you poorly. Aside from being charged for everything and nit pick on everything; there is no management in the building to talk to if you have an issue b/c the company is so small they have to hire an outside source at the airport. The staff treats you like criminals checking everything and looking for any little thing they can charge you with. From there you¡¯ll be driven on a bus shuttle to the plane. Literally they are some stingy that you have to sit in the back of the bus if you are not priority. This doesn¡¯t even matter, but it¡¯s just that type of scroungy feel to the whole experience that makes it misserable. 3) They delayed the flight twice overall. I¡¯ve flown about probably 10 or 15 times to places all over the world. I have had some great ones and some rough ones, but this is by far the worst. I will probably never fly with Wizz Air again and I encourage anyone else reading this review to do the same. Pay a little extra because it will literally cost the same amount or less in the end anyway.

On the first leg from Tirana to Luton, I tried to check in via the Wizz Air app, however it explicitly said that I could not check in online due to regulations from Tirana's airport. I went to the check in counter the day of the flight and I was harshly told by a Wizz Air employee to pay the charge or leave the airport, even though I was clearly explaining to them that checking in online was purely impossible- they refused to listen. The first absolute scam from this airline. The second leg was an even more dreadful experience. Before boarding a woman started interrogating all passengers like she was a prison warden about the number of carry on bags they had. I was fine, however there were people who were forced to pay cash on the counter, just for carrying a lap top in their hands. Second absolute scam. The flight was supposed to take off at 6 a.m UK time, but it took off at 7:30 a.m. The reason was ""a missing oxygen bottle"" which had to be delivered from Gatwick Airport. To add to the misery, we were left to wait not even inside the terminal, but in the stairs leading to the tarmac, for about an hour. The air was humid and I started having difficulty breathing. Many older people had to lie down on the ground, and many children started getting ill. It seemed like a scene from an apocalyptic movie - at 6 a.m on a Tuesday morning in London! The flight itself was alright. I want to point out that the captain of the flight, an Irish gentleman, fully deserved the title as he apologised profusely on behalf of a ridiculous airline. Nothing but respect for him. Every single other Wizz Air employee, particularly the ground crew needs to take some lessons not just on their jobs, but also on basic human decency.

Uncomfortable, cramped seats, overcrowded (my cabin bag had to go into the hold), and really not that cheap for a budget airport. Ground service was minimal and sullen, while cabin staff were professional, but forced to constantly try to sell drinks and duty free, making it hard to relax and get to sleep on the flight.

Like we have not got jobs to go to. I have complained directly to them to claim the european inconvenience payment of €400 per person and they claimed 'extraordinary circumstances' in both situations. We went through a law firm and they managed to get our payment for both cases. Recently, they have also changed the luggage on board rules and supposedly, they take all small hand suitcases to hold. We boarded the plane among the first 10 people and our suitcase was taken to hold. There were at least 30 suitcases (we counted, and we stopped counting after a while) which were taken on board after we boarded. So what is this s#1t? If only a certain number of suitcases are allowed on board, why don't they offer to allow people to check their hand luggage in advance? The staff have always been incredibly condescending and there seems to be a lack of training across the company as we have always been given contradicting explanations for the concerns we have raised.

I noticed at home when I reviewed our ticketing information was that no seats were assigned. So I went online and discovered that to select seats you had to pay for any seat on the plane. Since it was only a bit over an hour flight we decided to let them randomly select our seats even if the three of us, including our 12 year old daughter, were not seated together. A few days before the flight I again went online and attempted to check in. The first section of check-in covered two items: the need to pay to have even one bag checked in (at the rate of $50 per bag) and their rule that there was no guarantee that you could even take one carry-on unless you were willing to pay $6 Euros per passenger for a pass - which supposedly also allowed you to board early. Since we had three bags to check-in and three bags to carry-on I paid over $170 online in order to avoid paying a higher price (as noted in the online check out info) at the airport. The next section of the online check in asked me to select our seats - again at a price. Already upset at the outrageous check-in bag cost I opted not to select a seat and the web site booted me out. I assumed I would just check-in at the airport counter and find out what seats were assigned to us by the airlines. Imagine our surprise when we were informed by the clerk at the counter that we had failed to complete the check-in process and therefore he could not issue tickets. He directed us to another Wizz Air counter down the hall where we were told that our failure to complete the online check-in process would cost us 40 Euro per passenger (120 Euros total) - we had no other option but to pay the 120 Euros. We then returned to the ticket counter and finished checking in. When we arrived at the gate we discovered that the $6 Euro pass we had purchased for each of us allowed us to board early - ya, right, on the bus which then took us to the plane. We stood in the bus for over 30 minutes waiting to be taken to the plane. Once the bus arrived it was a mad house getting off the bus and trying to board the plane. We noticed that most of the other passengers had brought not one but two carry-ons with them. We could have avoided paying the $50/bag cost of checking in our three bags. Nothing but scams on the Wizz Air website. When we arrived in Bucharest we discovered that our large checked-in bag had one of its four wheels removed.

While on holiday I got an automated text from Wizz Air saying my flight had been changed and I would have got an email with my new flight details. There was no email, and my account showed I was still on the same flight. Looking on Facebook, a lot of people had this issue and Wizz Air admitted (on Facebook, where not many people would check) that the text was sent in error. This is after lots of people (according to their comments on Facebook) spent lots of money calling their premium number to check what happened to their flight (many waiting upwards of half an hour and many not even getting through!). I do wonder if that text was to encourage people to call the premium number for some extra revenue. My plane was the one I booked, albeit an hour late. As usual, Priority passengers had their passports checked and were allowed down to the shuttle bus to the plane. All other passengers (including me) were next. I was on the same bus as the Priority passengers (who were separated from us with a red cordon on the bus) and there were a few other buses behind us also going from the gate to the plane. We waited, standing, on the bus for over half an hour before it took us to the plane. What's worse (not for me, but for the Priority passengers) is the other buses left before us so ours actually got to the plane second last! Priority were the first to the bus and amongst the last on the plane. Aside from being fast-tracked through security at Budapest (which had no queue anyway), I saw no evidence of Priority adding anything. Once on the plane, staff were nice and obliging, and the plane was clean. Food is expensive but you can bring your own from the airport. Tea is 2.5 Euros but you can ask for extra hot water for free.

Tried again the next day. Tried from two different computers, and one cell phone. Same malfunction. Thought that now they know about it, and its time to get to the airport. When the error has been there for days, it should be possible to handle it at the airport. Of course not, they dont acknowledge the error or their responsibility for having working webpage functions, when their whole service is surrounded on customers handling ordering etc. Customer service wont pay me back the airport fee of course, and only repeats its my own responsibility. It's simply amazing to treat customers like this. What planet was Wizz founded on? Do they save money on angry customers?",negative,-0.549764,0,14,7.748934,4.820282

Boarding in Vilnius was quite messy, all passengers have been checked at gate and after this they had to wait on stairs for quite a long time, even those who had bought Priority pass - so actually there's no reason to buy it. The plane was located quite far from terminal building but we weren't taken there by bus, we had to go on foot. The aircraft is very cramped, the flight was fully booked and there wasn't enough place for hand luggage onboard so many passengers had to put it under the front seat which is not comfortable at all. However, all aforementioned is quite acceptable for a low-cost carrier. But after take-off it became extremely hot and it was very difficult to breathe, almost all passengers continued coughing during the whole flight - I suppose there were some issues with air conditioning? Nevertheless, the cabin crew was great, takeoff and landing very smooth, and the schedule has been followed to very punctually. But I find the issue with air conditioning absolutely unacceptable.",negative,-0.795544,0,15,7.748934,4.820282

There is a fast track at Geneva airport which costs 8 CHF per person (around 6.5€), but as there are no long lines at the airport, is not worth it to purchase it. I was one of the first to board the plane. There was no one sitting next to me, so it was like an Intra - European business class seat. We took off on time.

If you have valuable things in a bag, staffs say to you to bring them only into the machine and staffs take your bag. As a priority passenger, I could bring 2 bags into machine.

Bad service turned it into a very expensive (and frustrating) experience for me and my family! I traveled with my wife and two children to Romania, and we were denied boarding at the gate of the flight back from Bucharest to Israel, because of overbooking. No matter how much we argued and insisted, we were refused. I must emphasized that at any stage there was no call for volunteers to give up boarding, as the EU regulation require in case of overbooked flights, before performing involuntary denial of boarding. The staff member at the gate told us that they are missing one seat, so 3 of us can travel. We explained that we cannot split. Only after we got back to the ticket office at the departure flights counters we were told that we are entitled only for a single denied boarding, as the 3 others had seats and chose not to fly. We had to buy new flight tickets for the next day in a different airline, as Wizz Air had no seats available in the following days. These one way tickets cost us more than the entire round trip with Wizz Air (although it was with another low cost airline). We had to pay for hotel another night, meals, transportation etc. I submitted a complaint and sent copies of all required documents and receipts. It took more than a month for Wizz Air customer service to respond, and their feedback is that they are willing to compensate me for denied boarding of only a single passenger. They provided very limited compensation for the other passengers. The overall compensation Wizz Air agreed for is €984, while my overall expenses caused by this denial of boarding was €2,426. Seriously, Wizz? We know that airlines overbook the flights, but compensate properly your customers when they are harmed by it! At least reimburse the actual extra expenses caused, I am not even talking about compensation for the frustration and trouble. Follow the regulations and ask for volunteers before you perform involuntary denial of boarding! Don¡¯t split up families! If you deny boarding from a member of a family under a single reservation, compensate the entire family! None of us wanted to stay there. The youngest kid was crying, we all wanted to get home already, we had good reason that we explained that prevented us from splitting. Beware of Wizz Air.

Then returning we find out much to out chagrin that we had to check in online, bear in mind no-one saw fit to inform us of this, not Groupon, the airline or the company we booked it through. And to make it worse me and my girlfriend were seated at opposite ends of the plane. The ground staff were of no help, not even attempting to help us find a solution let alone sympathise with our problems. So in summary, this airline may be cheap but if you have even a modicome of care for the pleasantness of your journey then I cannot recommend enough paying slightly more and flying with a reputable airline and I'm including easy jet and Ryanair so that should tell you something.

? Verified Review ,A320,Business,Economy Class,Cluj-Napoca to Dortmund ,17-Sep,3,5,,,,4,3,yes,10,"  Nice journey with Wizz Air from Cluj to Dortmund and return. Both flights had little delays (not more than 15-20 minutes). The captain explained the reasons for delay (on return they hit a bird on landing before our flight and maintenance was necessary). The crew members were friendly and polite. Baggage drop-off, boarding and clearing the airport have been easy and no trouble at all. I liked at return flight the route detailed explanations offered by the captain. I advise XXL seat booking for tall people, since the ordinary seats have little legroom.",positive,0.30711,0,14,7.748934,4.820282
? Verified Review ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Luton to Budapest,17-Sep,,,,,,1,1,no,1,  Luton to Budapest. One of the worst boarding experiences. It was chaotic because the staff were getting people to measure their hand luggage next to what looked like a micro purse dimension 25cm x 32cm x 42cm which is one of the smallest by the budget airlines. Staff were rude demanding money and threatening to cancel the flight ticket if hand luggage fee was not paid promptly. They were patronising by repeatedly reminding and quoting the allowed baggage dimensions. There was no prompt when checking in either. Cheap airline poor service and unhelpful staff. Please avoid this airline. ,negative,-0.8743,0,14,7.748934,4.820282
? Verified Review ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sibiu to Nuremberg,17-Sep,3,5,3,,,5,5,yes,9,"  My mother, a very nervous flyer had a panic attack on our flight from Sibiu to Nuremberg. We called a flight attendant that stayed the whole flight with my mother, calming her etc. Because of the discomfort caused by the flight, the flight attendant offered us to go into the cockpit at the end of the flight which was very exciting.  Overall, a great flight experience with very professional and friendly crew of Wizzair flight W6 3767.",negative,-0.374741,0,14,7.748934,4.820282
? Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to Kaunas,17-Aug,3,3,1,,,3,4,yes,6,"  Tel Aviv to Kaunas. The departure was from the smaller terminal 1 at Ben Gurion airport. Since check in is done well in advance, and since I did not check in any luggage, I could pass the long lines and go directly to security. This was very convenient. If you don't want to pay extra you can only carry a small bag at this airline, but they make that very clear even in their advertisement, so it can hardly be a surprise for anyone. What is more annoying is that you cannot choose seats at check in without having to pay extra. Consequently I was placed in a middle seat, even though the aircraft was only half full. But the person next to me moved away quickly so I could move to the aisle seat. Seat comfort was not too bad, the seatbacks could not be reclined, but being tall I find it more annoying if people in front of me recline their seatbacks without looking back. The catering on board was very uniinteresting, and for someone who does not eat gluten there was hardly anything available. But I had brought my own food, so that was not a problem. All in all the flight was pleasant enough, and even though we were a bit delayed at departure we arrived in time. Since this is a low cost airline my expectations were not very high, but I would not hesitate to fly Wizz Air again, especially since they have lots of interesting destinations that no one else flies to.",negative,-0.668373,0,14,7.748934,4.820282
? Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Split to Luton,17-Aug,2,1,2,1,,1,2,no,3,"  Split to Luton. We flew to Luton to save money although when looking at the cabin bag sized we realised they would only allow a tiny back pack to fly with, and to fly with a normal cabin size suitcase would cost you ?20 there and ?20 back! On the flight staff were miserable quite rude and looked as though they didn't want to be there at all. The drinks were reasonably priced but the food was diabolical. You don't expect a lot from plane food but a chicken baguette you can't get wrong - however ours turned up half the ingredients missing and cost us ?6. I won't be flying with them again I saved no extra money. I've added 3 photos of what the baguette was described as the picture vs the reality.",negative,-0.811361,0,14,7.748934,4.820282
? Verified Review ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Budapest,17-Sep,3,3,,,,1,4,no,3,"  I fly with Wizz Air every week on the same route from Birmingham to Budapest and have done for over year. Until a few months ago they were generally on time with the occasional delay. I am unsure what has changed but every weekly flight I catch in both directions for the last 2-3 months is late, generally 1 hour late arriving. I used to think Wizz Air was a good airline, good value and reliable but I now dread my weekly commute due to constant lateness. Very disappointing Wizz Air!",negative,-0.487994,0,14,7.748934,4.820282
? Verified Review ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Eindhoven to Budapest,17-Aug,3,4,4,,,5,4,yes,7,"  Eindhoven to Budapest. I've flown twice (or 4 if you include return) with Wizz Air. This time was a new plane but really minimal seats. The plane could not land in Budapest because of bad weather, it had plenty of fuel so we waited, but eventually got redirected to another airport, together with another Wizz flight and a Ryanair flight. There we got coupons for a meal, the Ryanair passengers did not receive this. Then there supposed to come buses to bring us to Budapest, 5 hours later there still were no buses, so together with a few other passengers we decided to get a train. Ryanair organized buses to the train station. Overall information on the airport was rather minimal, I don't know if this is accountable to Wizz or to the Airport. Wizz has all the phone numbers and e-mail addresses, so they could have send text or e-mail messages, which enough people could have read. Stewards on this flight were very nice and friendly, on the return flight that went normal they were a bit grumpy, but OK. Their website is very clear and detailed. Food on board was cheaper then in Eindhoven airport, I only had some water but the food looked fine.",positive,0.322221,0,14,7.748934,4.820282
