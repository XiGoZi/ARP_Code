Return flight delayed by well over an hour with no information from them other than gate to be announced. Then a pathetic excuse about an earlier fight delay elsewhere that shows they have no slack in their operations. A pathetic service from a pathetic airline of what has to be the airline of the last resort when no other options exist to travel.

✅ Trip Verified ,A320NEO,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Porto to Ajaccio via Geneva,24-May,3,4,,,,3,5,yes,7," My EasyJet flights from Oporto to Ajaccio were generally positive, with a couple of minor bumps. The flights themselves were comfortable and on time, except for a one-hour delay on the connecting flight from Geneva to Oporto. Unfortunately, there weren't any announcements from the ground staff about the delay, which was frustrating. Be wary of the duty-free offers. They advertise big savings compared to high street stores, but I found the same perfumes significantly cheaper (around 5 euros less) in shops on the main street.",negative,-0.384695,1,29
Not Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Tenerife,24-May,2,5,,2,2,2,2,no,2,"   EasyJet are scammers. We were never informed of their monetise the baggage policy, until we arrived at the boarding gate, and could no longer transfer stuff into hold cases. My 76 year old wife was charged £48 because her cabin bag, which she has used for years and years had become 1"" too long, because Easy Jet decided to cash in by making a new ""rule"". They have done this, knowing full well, and in complete contravention, of the decision by the European Parliament's Committee, to now enforce a cabin baggage rule made in 2014. The European Court of Justice refers to airlines' varied size and weight standards for hand baggage, hidden fees, and misleading consumers about the true cost of air travel. The explanation given, was that the bag was a flight safety hazard, in the event of the aircraft being evacuated. However, by paying Easy Jet £48, the bag was no longer a flight safety hazard, apparently. The other explanation given was that it would not go under the seat, but would have to go in the overhead lockers, designed for that purpose. Which, of course, was exactly what always happened before Easy Jet changed their rules. Incongruously, prior to take off, cabin crew (quite correctly) ask for any significant items to be stored in the overhead locker. Now, if that isn't misleading and monetising customers, then I don't know what is. Easy Jet may seem like a cheap option. It isn't. If you have a problem, and there are often problems travelling, Easy Jet will do nothing to help you. Better, much better, simply fly with a reputable airline. Superficially, it might appear a few pounds more; but, when you need customer service, you are much more likely to get it.",negative,-0.618626,1,29
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hurghada to Gatwick,24-May,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,3,"  I have been travelling for 5 years, between Hurghada/Gatwick, approx 7 - 8 times per year. I am sick to death of this airline, but unfortunately have no other option of another direct flight, since WizzAir stopped their flights. I need wheelchair assistance which I always book in advance, yet, I am never provided with the service they claim they can provide. The wheelchairs provided in Hurghada airport are all broken & on arrival 3 weeks ago, I was dumped on a seat at the far end of the arrivals corridor & completely abandoned for 35 minutes, until the pilot & crew came past & asked if I was OK. I explained the situation & they kindly went to find a porter with another wheelchair to rescue me. The porters always demand a tip & often rummage through my purse, dictating to me which notes they will take for this 'free special assistance service', whilst also asking me for some of my painkillers, pens, sweets etc. The porters only provide a wheelchair service after you have queued to get into the airport, queued to have your passport check, queued to get through the first x-ray & bag/body searches, 2nd bag search & checked your bags in. They only wheel you to the gate, not down the gangways to the plane, so you are left standing in queues to board the plane for 30 - 45 minutes. My flight back from Hurghada on Sunday 26th May was delayed for over 26 hours & absolutely no special assistance was provided at all to disembark the plane, when the pilot decided to abort take off. I was left to struggle all the way back through the airport again & onto a bus which drove us all the way out to a hotel in Sahl Hasheesh, then struggle to offload my luggage from the bus & in the pitch black, at 4am, all round the huge hotel complex, to my room. No Easyjet rep made an appearance & I only knew when the bus was coming to pick us up to take us back to the airport, through rumours from other passengers. It is also infuriating that on every flight back to the UK from Hurghada, they never have any food. Only 7/10 flights to Hurghada have food available. I am diabetic & had arrived at Hurghada Airport at 6pm for my 8.45pm flight on Sunday. The 1st delay was apparently due to the plane arriving late from the UK. The 2nd delay was apparently due to a crew member being sick & the 3rd delay, was due to a technical issue with 2 of the 3 plane's communication systems as we were taking off. We were all sat on the plane, on the runway for over 2 hours, with no food or drink, only half a plastic cup of warm tap water each. We reached the hotel we were bussed to at approx 3.15am, but there was no food or drink available. All the restaurants were shut. The first opportunity to drink anything was from the minibar at 4.45am, once I had struggled alone to my room. Still, no food had been provided at all. I was feeling extremely unwell by then & tried to call Reception using the phone in the room, but it was broken. The next thing I remember was waking up at about 12.10pm. I struggled to get up & outside to try to find something to eat. Luckily, I came across a fellow passenger who escorted me to a restaurant for lunch. It was the fellow passenger who told me where the nearest pharmacy was & the rumour she had heard about a bus picking us up at 6pm. Arrived at the airport for our 10pm flight, which was delayed until 11pm. Again, no food on the flight. The excuses for flight delays are usually; pilot stuck on M25, crew sick, plane late in, technical issues, etc.",negative,-0.724085,1,29

On this flight there is no positive except being transported from AYT to EDI. I honestly can't remember the last time I was on a flight with such a disinterested lazy crew. They did one service after take off at break neck speed then disappeared. Apparently they were having dinner! How long it takes to have a ping dinner and a coffee appears to be at least 2hrs 30mins. They were visible individually when they took it in turns to make the long journey from the aft galley to the front galley only to sit down and read a book. Their attitude was quite unbelievable. If I had to base EZY on this flight alone I'd never step foot on one of their aircraft again.

Happy to pocket customers money for their mistakes. You may think that £60 doesn't matter for being duped into paying for an extra bag through your faulty app, however my one way flight (including baggage) came to approx £270 so an additional payment of £60 through the app equates to a 20% overpayment into your pocket.  But the principal stands. I'm a frequent traveller and use many airline apps. And that's why I know what you are doing is wrong. After taking the time to raise this issue with easyJet, twice, and after easyJet failed to reimburse me, I'm going to take it upon myself to try and raise awareness because there certainly is an integrity issue on your part.",negative,-0.806992,1,29

EasyJet has very restrictive luggage requirements, particular the minuscules dimensions permitted. In CDG Airport, the Terminal D is quite remote; it took me an hour to get there properly from T1, including busses, several passport, BP, and security checks, makes transit in Paris a hassle. Requirements for EasyJet to board early and check in baggage VERY early is, unnecessarily, very strict and scares people to waste a lot of time by being in gate area by far too early. Flight was delayed 1 hour. Information provided was sparse and unclear. Delays of ½ to 1 hour is more common on this route by easyJet. Onboard staff professional, announcements were good, provided by a Danish pilot called Andersen. Seats are bolstered, good, but can’t recline. Catering onboard expensive. But altogether somehow OK.

The flying experience was excellent and the service was friendly and cordial. Cabin Crew was excellent in their appearance and duties. The updates from the Pilot and First Officer were frequent and helpful. The bag drop process was automated at LGW, but through a sultry human agent at LCA. In LGW during boarding a member of the ground staff immediately took out the POS machine to charge &48 per cabin bag, even though it did conform to their tight frame contraption. So without checking the bags, she tried to grab £48 per passenger. I think that easyJet has to look into this. In the end we were not charged as our bags did fit within their strict frame. Apart from their greedy extra charges for hand baggage attempt, I would say that easyJet is very very good. Two flights in March 2024 LCA-LGW and LGW-LCA in A320s with winglets (G-EJCV and G-EJCR) Will fly with easyJet again.",positive,0.608713,1,29

We were forced to pay 48 pounds each for the backpacks which, surprisingly, had come perfectly packed on the outbound flight to Edinburgh. The height of ridiculousness was on the plane, after paying because the backpack supposedly didn't fit under the seat, the flight attendant told me that I had to put it under the seat and I couldn't use the cabin. When asked why I had to pay, I couldn't answer. A shame and an abuse to go get money at no cost. Experiência horrível. Fomos obrigados a pagar 48 libras cada pelas mochilas que, pasme-se, tinham vindo perfeitamente acondicionadas no voo de ida para Edimburgo. O cúmulo do ridículo foi dentro do avião, depois de pagar porque supostamente a mochila não cabia debaixo do assento, a comissária de bordo me dizer que a tinha que pôr debaixo do assento e não podia usar a cabine.

So there were no hot meals or sandwiches left by the time they reached us in row 6 on the return flight. Surely if we commit to purchasing food on board then EasyJet should commit to having some available or at least sending an email when plane left Gatwick so we could purchase at airport.

While I appreciate the efficiency of easyJet, I feel compelled to share a concerning experience related to the boarding process. As one of the first passengers at the gate, I observed an easyJet employee who appeared to be responsible for ensuring compliance with luggage policies. Unfortunately, his approach was marked by a level of rudeness that was quite disconcerting.

Be warned there are no seats if this happens and none of the the phone charging points worked on the day. If you have your boarding pass on your phone you're in trouble. This is my first and last easyJet flight. Definitely not budget prices. BA business class would have cost less. Flying used to be fun but with easyJet it was an ugly, stressful unpleasant experience.

On arrival at a remote gate, firstly we had to wait over 10 minutes for steps to arrive, and then a further 5 minutes for a bus to arrive to take us to the terminal. Cabin made light of the fact, that they have come to expect this at Berlins new airport. Frankly, if I was paying service fees to the airport, I would be kicking off about the lack of service provided. As a customer, it would put me flying into Berlin with EasyJet into Berlin (flew into Berlin in September with BA and though then had a gate straight away, had to wait 90 minutes for baggie to arrive).

Eventually they opened up more desks but took nearly an hour to drop off bags. Next was security, queued out again with only a few channels open. Took a further 25 mins to get through this. Then passport control, once again queued out with only a couple of desks open. I suspect had our hotel transfer not been early we could have easily missed the flight as we only ha a short time after arriving at the gate before boarding started.

A passenger in the same row lay down and started to occupy the seat. Neither my son nor I were asked for consent or even informed of this action. All I could tell was a passenger who looked as though they were recovering from a heavy night and wanted a lie down to recover. To enable this, my son had to sacrifice their seat for an indefinite length of time. I raised my issue with the aircrew. My concern was passed between two cabin crew and escalated to their superior. I was told that as I'd momentarily vacated, I had to maintain this status quo and sacrifice my son's seat. No alternative was offered. No timeframe was given. The only option I was presented was for both my son and I to squeeze into the same seat. It transpired the situation lasted for the majority of the flight. The FAA states ""The safest place for your child ... is not in your lap"". Yet this is the situation I found myself in and had to try to explain to my son. When I escalated my concerns, the best the senior cabin crew could offer was advice I should write to customer services and request a refund for my son's seat. I followed this advice.

As a party of 4 we each booked and paid for 15kg hold luggage, before departure, I received an email saying we had 23kg. 3 of us had about 10kg and one went for 23kg. bag drop at Bristol was exemplary, machines worked well and helpful staff on standby to assist - no mention of extra fee. Bordeaux departure was mess, it says Billi L on the boarding pass, but who would know that that meant a shed at the end of the main terminal that was for low cost airlines - all the Departures signage coming from the hire car drop zone is to the main terminal in the opposite direction. At bag drop there was initially only 1 person sitting at a desk who was more interested in talking to colleagues rather than check in passengers' luggage. Then 2 more arrived and a panic to pull forward passengers travelling to Palma and Marseilles. The last member of our party was charged 45 euros for excess baggage despite having the same baggage as on the outbound flight. The rest of the boarding procedure was an equally overcrowded, hot and unpleasant experience. Why not use the main terminal, especially now it is about empty following France's partial domestic flight ban. Low visibility at Bristol resulted in an aborted landing followed by diversion to Cardiff. The crew were excellent, they kept us informed throughout, the captain stood at the front of the cabin and gave updates directly. The weather in Bristol cleared, they refuelled and got us there a little 2 hours late, well handled.",negative,-0.517333,1,28
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Naples,23-Sep,,,,,,1,3,no,1,"  I have flown with easyJet several times in previous years, but this time I had the unfortunate experience of learning about their handling of flight cancellations. First, I should note that the easyJet terminal at Schipol Airport is separate from all other airlines and has inadequate seating and very limited services. My flight from Amsterdam to Naples was canceled about 30 mins before the departure time, without any prior notice whatsoever that there might be any problems. There were no easyJet staff available to explain what to do. Asking other passengers with previous experience of easyJet cancellations was the only option. I went to the easyJet desk in the baggage claim area but the staff did nothing to help the stranded passengers. Recovering my checked package took 2 hours. After a long delay, the easyJet app offered the option to rebook on another flight, but in fact there were no other flights to Naples, Rome or Milan during the following two days. Compared to my experience with other airlines in similar situations, this was absolutely the worst.",negative,-0.851249,1,28
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Naples to London Gatwick,23-Sep,1,3,3,,,1,4,no,3," Pretty poor performance by easyJet at their “focus city” of Naples. Whilst bag-drop was straightforward and easy, getting through passport control was a total nightmare. At least a couple of hundred passengers were trying to reach the immigration booths at the B gates but were prevented by doing so by temporary barriers erected ostensibly to control the crowds but which instead resulted in passengers being kettled and trapped in scary conditions (i.e. risk of being crushed and little to no working air conditioning). One could argue this is the airport’s responsibility rather than the airlines’, but both Ryanair and jet2 sent their staff to the barriers to allow ONLY their passengers past the barriers; easyJet passengers were not allowed through and had to wait for other airline passengers to pass through and then slip through behind them whenever they could. EasyJet did not send down any staff to advocate for their passengers stuck behind the barriers and it was the most chaotic crowd I have ever seen waiting to be stamped out of any country. As a result, our flight was delayed by one hour simply because half of the passengers were still waiting to clear passport control (I overheard one of the ground staff confirm this to the cabin crew after I had been able to finally board). The flight itself was fine, but the experience at Naples airport was harrowing and it was upsetting to see how other low cost airlines bothered to get their passengers passed the barrier whilst easyJet staff were nowhere to be seen.",negative,-0.854276,1,28

First, buying a ticket is full of pop ups and weird advertising jumping in your way; glitches and more glitches; their boarding is always last minute; at the entry in the lounge you see the fed up, grumpy, not well-mannered staff; the staff always try to find something on you to charge you extra. On my last trip there's this staff member in LGW, not very presentable, checking the boarding passes - he asked many travellers to insert their baggage in a tiny space to verify the measurements; if it was half an inch bigger than that, then he tells the travellers that would be £48 extra charge.  The only pleasurable person so far was the pilot, could see and hear his positiveness; he was assisting a little the staff in the flight to do their duties; then he apologised to us that he cannot do that anymore as he's got a plane to fly.",negative,-0.812827,1,28

Afterwards I received a confirmation email saying the flight departs in Prague and flies to Milan. After I saw that email I immediately called EasyJet's customer service which was more useless. First he told me that there are no flights from Berlin to Milan at all and that I cannot change my flights at all. When I advised him that the airport is called Milan LIN that EasyJet planes fly to from Berlin, he told me that it would be cheaper for me to just make a new booking as it would be cheaper. However, I would still have to pay for those wrong flights from and to Prague since the booking has been made more than 24 hours ago. I asked him if there are any exceptions because obviously there must be a mistake (and it's possible that this mistake was made by the airline, because why would I book a flight from Prague) but he told me there's nothing that he can do for me. I went online and changed the flights on the website myself. There is no option to change both flights (there and return) at the same time, so I had to pay rebooking fees twice. Moreover there were no suitable return flights available anymore that leave in the evening, so now I had to take one a day later and have to pay for another night at the hotel. All in total I've paid now close to $900 AUD for flights + extra night at the hotel in Milan for one short trip from Berlin to Milan and return, because most likely there is some sort of bug in the system (either skyscanner or easyjet). This is more than frustrating!

Poor boarding management at Luton airport, however. Boarding was via stairs and those allocated to board at the rear of the plane boarded as normal whereas those allocated to board via the front stairs were made to queue for around 15 to 20 minutes, standing on the tarmac. Later I discovered by chance that this was to allow a disabled passenger to be loaded first. This is understandable (and I don't mind waiting for that reason) but the failing of easyJet was that they did not communicate this reason to us whilst we were standing in the queue, not knowing what was going on.

EasyJet's app was very good in keeping us up to date with the latest status / estimated times of the flight. The app alerted me to potential problems about 5 hours before the flight, when the air traffic control failure first began impacting flights. At one point it seemed as if we might be 4 hours delayed but in the end we were less than 90 minutes delayed, which was good considering how many other hundreds of flights were cancelled and thousands delayed. We were told to check-in at the usual time; there was no queue at the airport for baggage drop. Staff were friendly, though no explicit mention was made of the likely delays! Boarding was a little chaotic as it required buses to transport everyone from the terminal to the aircraft (so anyone with speedy boarding would have only have had a marginal advantage, if any). At this stage we were all just happy the flight was still going ahead.

We are a family of 4: 2 adults and 2 small children. It was impossible to find any alternative flight on the same day to the same destination with 4 free seats. The app also didn't find any available hotel. Spending a night in the airport with 2 small children is not an option. So we had to find another flight to another destination in another country and pay everything ourselves on the spot. That's not the biggest problem though. The problem is, EasyJet now does not want to take responsibility and reimburse the extra costs, as the circumstances were ""out of their control"".

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Milan to Gatwick,23-Jul,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," I am writing to express my deep disappointment and sheer frustration with the appalling service I experienced during my recent flight with EasyJet on 20th July 2023. My journey with your airline, on Flight EZY8312 from Milan Malpensa to London Gatwick, was an absolute nightmare from the very outset. To begin with, all the electronic check-in gates at Milan Malpensa Airport were either out of order or deliberately switched off, resulting in an infuriatingly slow and chaotic process. It was quite an ordeal to witness the incompetence of the ground staff, and to add to the misery, there was only one overwhelmed lady dealing with the needs of over three hundred passengers. It is beyond comprehension how an airline of EasyJet's stature could allow such a woefully understaffed situation to occur. Unfortunately, the frustration did not stop there. Upon reaching the departure gate, I was greeted with the distressing sight of an obviously intoxicated and vulgar man causing a commotion at the bar. It was abundantly clear to anyone with basic judgment that this individual was in no condition to fly. He then proceeded to wander around the terminal, rudely interacting with both staff and passengers, while attempting to light a cigarette. The potential safety risk he posed to everyone on the flight was glaringly evident, and I was utterly shocked to witness the inaction of the EasyJet staff in preventing him from boarding the plane. As time passed, the intoxicated passenger's behavior grew increasingly aggressive towards anyone who dared to approach him. Astonishingly, the gate staff checked him in without any regard for the safety of the other passengers, allowing him to board the plane despite the obvious risk he presented. I was among the last passengers to board, and the atmosphere on the plane was one of fear and discomfort as this individual continued to disrupt and behave aggressively throughout the flight. Only after an excruciating two-hour delay and numerous complaints from concerned passengers did the decision to call the police to remove the intoxicated man from the flight finally come about. This delay was further compounded by the lack of clear communication from your staff. Even the pilot expressed disbelief at how this man was allowed to board the plane in his inebriated state. The incident not only caused unnecessary distress to passengers but also created an unprofessional and unsafe environment that is wholly unacceptable. The apparent indifference of your staff towards the welfare of your customers and their failure to act promptly in such a dangerously evident situation is deeply reprehensible.",negative,-0.84771,1,28

I could not afford that delay and took the Eurostar back. I understood that since I did not cancel the return flight I could not get compensated for it. But the onward flight had been a problem with the Airline. I filed for compensation and after 2 days got the message that I was not eligible for it because I did not travel on the flight. A cancelled flight and I was supposed to travel on it. I spent half an hour with an agent with capacity for inefficiency. She took fifteen minutes to grasp what I was looking for. And then she said the outbound flight was Delayed and Not Cancelled. I asked her why the board displayed Cancelled and whether the flight had taken off.

They have no staff in the airports and will tell you to pay for your own expenses and claim back, which they will then deny. They have cost us thousands and haven’t been in touch with us at all. They’ve even blocked our social media comments.  We were supposed to return to the U.K. on the 23rd from Croatia, and so we headed to the airport for our flight from Split to Manchester. We sat for hours in the airport, and noted delay after delay. During the delays, we received no updates from staff, only learning of delays from the easyJet app by checking manually and we were given no food or water. It’s suggested that you should receive vouchers for the delay, but we never did and it would have gotten you a quarter of a bag of the cheapest chocolate from there anyway. Duty free was incredibly expensive and limited, as were the facilities. We sat there for hours and after lots of delays with no communication, easyJet cancelled the flight without notifying us and left everyone stranded in the airport with no help or guidance. The flight appeared as cancelled 40 minutes before the staff decided to make a tannoy announcement. You were left to rebook the flights through the EJ app; there were none for days and they booked up quickly so our group had to split and take whatever was available, paying for the hotel and other costs out of our pocket. The next direct flights weren’t for days, and the other flights were all connecting ones to various places across Europe (Amsterdam, Milan, Rome) etc and not only were they with huge layovers, there were not enough seats on any of them, and also experienced the problem of being during the following days. Our smaller group had taken the Croatia to Milan connecting flight option, as we had group members with limited medication and health issues which we decided were the most important people to get to the U.K. earlier. We were unhappy with all the travelling time but it was the fastest option back into the U.K and we would have been trapped abroad for weeks otherwise, rather than days, so we were left with little choice. As there was no contact from easyJet and the staff were unhelpful, we also had to find a hotel at 11:30pm at night and then also find a way to get to it. Due to the timings, we had no food or water, and no breakfast but due to the dwindling amount of supplies and money we had on us, we had to keep our morning flight to Milan without being able to access any clean clothing or supplies. We did contact our travel insurance but as it was nearly midnight they were closed, and the next day they were completely unhelpful too as they state it is an issue for easyJet to resolve first, so they cannot and would not help.

✅ Trip Verified ,A321N,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Funchal to Lisbon,23-Jun,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Flight EJU7628 FNC-LIS was originally scheduled to leave at 22:00 on 02.06.2023 but was considerably delayed until 00:00 on 03.06.2023. The boarding staff at Funchal then informed that the flight had been cancelled. All passengers had already shown their boarding card and identification document. The boarding staff did not give any reason for the cancellation, only that they had just been informed. easyJet did not volunteer to send any messages during this hiatus. Legitimately outraged passengers shouted insults and kicked the easyJet queue separators. easyJet had a crew strike scheduled for 03.06.2023 from 00:00 but claims the ""delay"" [cancellation], was due to problems with the control tower, which is highly dubious because the TAP, Ryanair and SATA flights landed after the easyJet plane from Lisbon at 23:10 on 02.06.2023, without any disruptions. It was reported that easyJet had been transferring planes from European bases to Portugal with non-Portuguese crew, this combined with the strike in Portugal I believe was the real reason for the cancelation or delay, so the crew exceeded flight times. Despite appearing on the movement panel of Funchal airport as a cancelled flight, having in my possession and that I attach, photo with date and time watermark, besides the visible time on the panel itself, that the flight was cancelled. At this moment, abandoned at Funchal airport, I am forced to rebook a flight to Lisbon as soon as possible, which cost me an extra expense, inherent to easyJet's lack of professionalism, of 312.99 euros. Everything lead me to believe, with no room for doubt, that the flight was cancelled. Only at 01:30 of 03.06.2023, when I had already been forced to reschedule my trip due to easyJet's total lack of diligence, does easyJet send an SMS that the flight was rescheduled for 12:00 of 03.06.2023, 14 hours after the scheduled and original departure of the flight. easyJet did not provide the possibility to accept or refuse the rerouting, they only changed the booking and checked in by myself, without any consent, whether I accepted the new flight, wanted a cash or voucher refund. Under the terms of Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, of 11 February 2004, I am entitled to compensation for the 14-hour delay I suffered - if it is not correctly considered that this was an effective cancellation - to the value of at least 250.00 euros plus the expenses incurred with the need to rebook on the nearest flight (312.99 euros), since easyJet had not informed passengers until 1.30 am on 3 June 2023. This makes a minimum total of €562.99, which I will never give up. Beware of this company.",negative,-0.830475,1,28
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Gatwick to Naples,23-Jun,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  If you want to travel to EU from London, I'd suggest you use any other company. I flew to Naples on the 3/06/23. The flight landed in a different airport from what it should have been - we were informed halfway through the flight that we had missed NAP closing time by 6 minutes, and had to land in Milan (800km away) instead. Surely, EasyJet would have checked with Naples airport that we were ok to land at the ETA to authorise departure. I'm sure that, where there's a risk of missing closing time by 6 mins as we were told, the considerate & reasonable thing to do would be to cancel the flight. I have reasons to believe that this was not done so that the incident could be marked as ""exceptional circumstances"", so that EasyJet could get away with not refunding passengers as per its refund policy. So either the staff was so naïve as to not consider that flights can miss closing time by 6 mins, or this was deliberate fraudulent behaviour. Either way, it was unacceptable. EasyJet kept us waiting 5 hours at the airport, before boarding us and only then diverting our plane. We were also promised that EasyJet would provide accommodation and alternative transport, only to find out after 2 hours' wait that no, this would not be provided and we would have to think for ourselves. I was going to Naples to attend a wedding, which I missed. I cannot think of anything that would repay me not only of the financial cost, but also the time waste (the whole trip took me 21 h), and the psychological stress the company has deliberately inflicted on me.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Luton to Edinburgh,23-Apr,3,3,,,,1,1,no,1," I am writing to denounce my profound regret regarding my flights with easyJet. Customers try to choose EasyJet because they are low costs but the hidden fees and the staff behaviour made me spend with easyJet really more than other airlines such as Air France or Lufthansa. I think that easyJet has many problems including the fact that a flight can only be changed for an important cost (£49) when it is within two months (who will book and change a flight before two months?). Hence the change would represent twice the price of the flight price. However, I am writing regarding a specific issue. Yesterday, I had two flights with easyJet, the first from Lyon to London Luton and the second from London Luton to Edinburgh. Three days before my flight I bought the right to have a large cabin bag (that cost me £47 for the first flight and £15 for the second one). Everything was OK with the first flight where I had my cabin bag with me in the cabin (where its place should be). However, in London Luton, the staff member at the check-in desk forced me to pay 48 additional pounds for the same cabin bag with a 10.9kg weight (in order to check it in as hold luggage). Please note that the same bag fitted really well on the plane for the first flight (from Lyon to London Luton). Moreover, I observed that other passengers had cabin bags larger than mine. Hence, today I observed that easyJet staff are not coherent in imposing additional fees to customers from one country to another. Also, they are not treating their customers in the same manner. I initially paid around £22 for this flight. In the end, it cost me £85: £22 (initial payment) + £15 (Large cabin bag ) + £48 (when they forced me to check in the large cabin bag that was supposed to come with me in the cabin) In addition to this, you can read on the news every day about the high rate of delays and cancellations of this airline. Don't underestimate the stress that can be caused by this airline. Also, it has plenty of other low costs around that do not have such bad reviews from customers. So, I would advise anyone to avoid this airline.",negative,-0.687802,1,28

We were apprehensive when the rules / charges relating to baggage taken on board were changed, but we experimented flying with backpacks only which will fit under the seats in front and found that we could easily manage with those for a week's holiday. Since then we have happily travelled lightly and found it very easy indeed. We actually registered the fact on our most recent trip that is the ""Speedy Boarding"" passengers who now rush to queue when the boarding staff appear because they want to make sure of finding locker space as close to their seats as possible. The rest of us who have not paid extra for anything can just wait and board at our leisure. I can't recall more than one major delay in all the years we have used easyJet and just a few minor ones. On our last trip earlier this month both the outward and inward flights left and arrived slightly early. Flying out from Liverpool as we invariably do, we find it very rare that there is any nitpicking about bag sizes (despite some of the bags that we sometimes see!) and the whole process of flying with easyJet for us is relatively relaxed. It obviously helps that we know the ropes and that we keep abreast of any rule changes e.g. regarding baggage. It does seem to me that some of the critics fail to check on things like this and therefore are at least partly to blame when faced with charges they did not expect.",positive,0.375859,1,28

This is definitely wrong what you are doing. My total trip London-Antalya, Antalya-Izmir, Izmir-Antalya, Antalya-London (4 flights) cost me £140 and just the cabin luggage extra charge cost me £40 because it didn't fit into your small (not standard) measurement box.

Also, the lady at the counter was extremely misbehaved and didn’t talk or attend us well.

Unfortunately, their system when you tried to get one of those selected seats, it does not allow you to continue with the process without buying obligatory another seat for the other passenger even I do not need it. So I decided to contact them by chat to see if they can get me a solution. After expending 30 minutes chatting with the customer service agent, he told me that he can provide me with this service but £5 more expensive than the website price. I asked him, why, and he mentioned that doing it through the website is cheaper. The situation was ridiculous, even though I spent precious time chatting with him, EasyJet wants to charge me more because of their badly designed system. I wished I could do it by the website without expending more time. So I recommend to people to even booked passenger tickets separately and you can manage the options individually or book flight tickets with another company which has a better system, EasyJet tries to get as much money as they can from their loyal customers. But never more, even I was one of the people affected by their famous data breach and never claim anything because I have been using Easy Jet for a long time and always I had good service.

The communication from Easy Jet came in a text. I still have a picture of the text received. We arrived at the gate prior to the original departure time to find that the flight was only 11 minutes late and because we were not at the gate two hours prior to the original departure time we were not allowed to board the airplane. The gate agent would lend absolutely no support. We were not the only passengers that were left that day. We each purchased our ticket and a carry on bag for the flight. There were no other flights from CDG airport available to Lisbon that day which was not an option for us as we had to meet our tour group.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Porto,22-Sep,2,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  At first, the ground crew manager came up to the passengers asking for volunteers to change to another flight (they would fly to Santiago de Compostela instead, and have a bus waiting for them to take them to Porto, and all they offered was a 500€ compensation, which is much less than what they should actually have to pay every passenger if no one took the offer and they had to refuse entry to passengers) as they mismanaged and overbooked this flight (even though they kept insisting on that it was an aircraft issue and they had to use a smaller one, while the people at the check in desks said clearly that it was overbooked). After that, the boarding process took ages, as some people had their passes invalidated due to the mentioned overbooking issue, meaning their seats (mine included) were unavailable. What's funny about this is that even people in rows as low as 10-15 or so had their seats invalidated. Anyway the boarding process took well over an hour for the lucky ones, all the while the ground crew was being extremely rude to people that didn't yet fully understand the issue, instead of explaining what they were trying to do to solve the issue (we passengers do not care how your worthless service screwed up the bookings, do not belittle us for not understanding what stupid excuses you make). Now for the unlucky ones that had their seats invalidated, we were put to the side while they tried to figure out what to do, all the while the ground crew kept insisting for us to take the 500€ and go on another flight or whatever, which I find extremely distasteful, knowing that all of us should be compensated much better had we been refused entry. Some people that were put to the side still accepted the offer, which in the end did make room for everyone else on the flight, after of course another hour or so of waiting. Now with all that said, I wouldn't have minded the issue as much if it weren't for the rudeness of the ground crew, the almost 2 hours of keeping us in the dark about what was going to happen to us, and the persistence of the ground crew manager to have us go to another flight, if you really wanted that to happen offer something better than just 500€, you know very well the compensation the airline would have to give us had we been refused entry. To add insult to injury, when at last the flight took off, we weren't offered anything at all in flight, not one measly bottle of water or a bag of chips or a small cup of coffee, nothing, absolutely worst customer service ever. As a bonus, the cabin crew hit my leg with the food/beverage cart while I was sleeping, admittedly I had my leg on the corridor, which I hadn't done on purpose or willingly, but instead of waking me up to move my leg, they just hit it and all I got was a ""Oh sorry sir"", then the attendant moved on like nothing happened.

Instead of 27e and being home before midnight, we spent 180e+ and were home at 02:30 am. Contacting easyJet to get some sort of reimbursement is a nightmare, apparently getting reimbursement for a delayed flight isn't possible, the reason given, because it was delayed. The delay according to EasyJet was extraordinary circumstances, according to our pilot these circumstances were EasyJet running an overfull schedule that Gatwick could not service, and EasyJet not having staff to service these flights. The impression I'm given by easyJet's communication then is that it's my own fault for having incurred additional costs on arrival because I choose to fly with EasyJet.

In response I was met with hostilities, one of the hostesses telling me I'm not in a hotel and shouldn't feel so entitled. I couldn't believe it, and they continued to say nasty things about me and my partner for the rest of the flight. Even when we were leaving the plane they decided to make snarky jokes about my partner to her face. Absolutely no consideration for their customers and even happy to insult their customers in front of them.

✅ Trip Verified ,A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Paris,22-Aug,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  I would like to report on a very unpleasant experience with a baggage inspector and in this context I would like to claim back the illegally collected fine of 29€. The whole thing happened on August 17th, 2022 at around 6:20 p.m. at Gate A38 of BER Airport, where I and my travel companion should have boarded flight EJU5539 to Paris Orly at 5:35 p.m. So the flight was already delayed. Shortly before passing the counter, a very unfriendly baggage inspector waved me out. He said my hand luggage was too big. It was a business case (see picture attached), which I have been using for years with EasyJet. On the baggage measurement system, it also fitted perfectly in terms of height and width. It only exceeded the thickness by a minimum of approx. 0.5 cm (which the baggage inspector had to indicate with a pen).  When I then took the suitcase to repack something for my travel companion, the employee yelled at me where I wanted to go. He threatened me it's too late, I have to pay or the luggage will stay here. After I still managed to take out a few things and the case continued to protrude slightly over the limit, I tried to explain to the employee that this is just air in the case and that the exact dimensions can be maintained by pressing lightly. The employee then slapped my hands and yelled ""hands off"" and threatened again that the suitcase had to stay here. Under this pressure, I paid in order not to miss the flight. I suspect that the employee deliberately wanted to play off his position of power. Unfortunately there is no way to counteract this. The customer service in particular treats the customers here like dirt. Either you get an email with an answer with copy & paste FAQ's or on Instagram it is claimed that unfortunately nothing can be done. (Where there is a will, there is a way? ) Hiermit möchte ich von einer sehr unangenehmen Erfahrung mit einem Gepäckkontrolleur berichten und in diesem Zusammenhang die widerrechtlich eingezogene Strafgebühr von 29€ (siehe Kontoauszug) zurückfordern. Das ganze spielte sich den 17.08.22 um ca. 18:20 am Gate A38 des Flughafen BER ab, an welchem ich mit meiner Reisebegleitung bereits um 17:35 auf den Flug EJU5539 nach Paris Orly hätte boarden sollen. Der Flug war also schon verspätet. Kurz vor passieren des Schalters winkte mich dann ein sehr unfreundlicher Gepäckkontrolleur heraus. Er meinte mein Handgepäckstück sei zu groß. Dabei handelte es sich um einen Business Koffer (siehe Bild im Anhang), mit dem ich schon seit Jahren problemlos mit EasyJet reiste. Auf der Gepäckmessanlage passte er von Höhe und Breite dementsprechend auch perfekt rein. Lediglich die Dicke überschritt er minimal um ca. 0,5 cm (was der Gepäckkontrolleur mit einem Kugelschreiber andeuten musste). Als ich dann den Koffer nahm, um etwas zu meiner Reisebegleitung umzupacken schrie mich der Mitarbeiter an wo ich hinwollte. Er drohte mir es ist zu spät, ich muss zahlen oder das Gepäck bliebe hier. Nachdem ich es dennoch schaffte ein paar Sachen herauszunehmen und der Koffer weiterhin minimal über die Begrenzung ragte, versuchte ich dem Mitarbeiter zu verdeutlichen, dass dies nur Luft im Koffer ist und durch leichtes andrücken exakt die Maße eingehalten werden. Daraufhin schlug der Mitarbeiter auf meine Hände und schrie ,,Hände weg"" und drohte erneut, dass der Koffer hierbleiben müsse. Unter diesem Druck zahlte ich, um den Flug nicht zu verpassen. Ich vermute, dass der Mitarbeiter bewusst seine Machtposition ausspielen wollte. Leider gibt es keine Möglichkeit dagegen vorzugehen. Insbesondere der Kundenservice behandelt die Kunden hier wie Dreck. Entweder man bekommt als Mail eine Antwort mit Copy&Paste FAQ's oder auf Instagram wird behauptet man könne da leider nichts tun.

We had a horrific time at Gatwick, met with disdain by the most unprofessional person I've ever met. Told to rebook missed flight for 2 days later and pay transfer of £120. No assistance offered and absolutely no sympathy. Stayed in a hotel and flew with TUI the next day. They were wonderful in comparison. We all need to write to the transport secretary instead of Easyjet because they couldn't care less what customers are saying.

I asked to speak to the duty manager, who eventually came over to see me, they explained that we were expected to manage our own booking via the app, after explaining out circumstances and the reasons we were due to travel they agreed to transfer us onto another easyJet flight to Antalya later on that day at 1520, and that we would have to pay for the onward 6 hour road transport to take us to our original location in Bodrum, to keep the receipt and claim the money back as there policy states they are only able to book road transport within the UK and not overseas. We were advised that our original flight was cancelled due to crew sickness. Apparently easyJet had no standby crew available in order to allow our flight to Bodrum depart. No empathy was shown by any easyJet ground staff at Bristol. When we boarded our new flight to Antalya we were advised by the cabin crew that the operating aircraft had not been restocked therefore no duty free was available and they had very limited food and drink to sell onboard. All in all a very poor show. Will not be using easyJet in the future",negative,-0.616501,0,27

Even the small cabin suitcase allowance is an add on. So we were forced to upgrade to “upfront seats” (+25€ per person) to have a cabin suitcase. This option also includes a priority check in with the EasyJet Plus queue to skip the normal long single queue for check in (see screenshot of easyJet email). We arrived in the Lisbon airport terminal 2 more than 2 hours in advance though we knew that we could have priority check in at EasyJet plus. When we waited for a while and finally arrived at the counter 203, the woman there was very rude and told us they do not have priority boarding today and that she doesn’t know anything about it. We insisted with the proof from our email we can skip the long queue at the check in counters. She didn’t even bother to look at what was written in that easyJet email nor give any explanation to why this service was removed “today”. She said the priority boarding is only for people who require special assistance. She was like “oh your flight is to Paris, you’ve got plenty of time” in a nonchalant manner. And she just spoke directly to the clients in the long queue, “next one”, waving us away.  No apologies, no emails from easyJet communicating this before we arrive at the airport and nothing was written before people started queuing. We paid an extra 50 euros for this extra convenience but they did not honour their contract and completely ignored us at the EasyJet plus counter. We spoke to the service centre (Portway) for the airline at the airport but the woman there also refused to help. Said she can’t do anything about it. So we waited almost 1.5 hours in the normal queue. After we got our boarding passes, I met a lady in front of us had the same case as what we endured, but worse. She was refused on the EasyJet plus priority check in queue and then refused her boarding because she was “late”. So she missed her flight. Both of us arrived more than 2 hours before the flight time (the check in counter only opens 2 hours before the flight time). But I had to run to the gates in order not to miss my flight.

If this is not extortion I don't know what is.

The resuming of flights by Ryanair on this route will put them back on their knees from where they shouldn't have left. Unfortunately they will very likely try to hijack the Regional Government with artificial arguments, which by incompetence, ignorance or dissimulation, they could concede to even more 'support', as if they needed.

Aweek before departure, we observed changes overnight in the restrictions introduced in Germany due to the prevailing pandemic. We have completed all the documents required by the German side so that our trip could take place. In addition, we checked the EasyJet app and EasyJet Hub every day to be sure that any additional changes would not affect our flight. The last change made to the Easyjet Hub took place on December 20. On the day of departure, the Easy jet staff responsible for boarding informed us that we would not be admitted to the flight to Berlin because we have Polish passports and we do not have a transit ticket (from Berlin Brandenburg airport to another airport). The situation was extremely stressful for us, because despite having all the necessary documents, we were refused a flight. We asked to contact the shift manager to confirm this decision, informing in advance that we had spent too much time trying to resolve the situation, which could result in the inability to change the flight (we could have changed the flight up to 2 hours before departure) we informed the staff that I am pregnant and this situation stressed me as well as my five-year-old son, yet we were told to wait for the manager's decision. After two hours, we have been informed that we would not be allowed to fly despite the documents we presented due to the fact that the staff interpreted the restrictions in their own way. We asked the staff for help in changing tickets to another flight, but we were refused help, suggesting that we could contact customer service ourselves on the number that we can find on the Internet.

After waiting another hour in the departure lounge, we were informed ‘Easyjet have been unable to find an alternative route or accommodation for the night. Please leave the airport by Gate number 5 and arrange your own accommodation’. After a frantic search online it did appear that all the hotels in Gibraltar were full. We were able to make contact with the host of the AirBNB that we had been staying at for the previous three nights and although his AirBNB was full, he made space for us in another property and charged us £160 for the emergency one nights stay. We took a taxi to his place and stayed the night. During the night we received an email from EasyJet informing us that our flight would take place at 18.00 the following day, 14th August. We therefore had to spend another whole day in Gibraltar. Obviously, we needed to eat and drink for our additional time there. At the end of this extra day, we took another taxi back to Gibraltar airport and thankfully our next flight left on time. A few days later we submitted an expenses claim to Easyjet for 2 x taxi transfers, 1 night’s accommodation and for meals and drinks during the day we were delayed. Easyjet have agreed to pay for one of our taxi journeys only! They have stated – the second taxi expense did not show a ‘route’ on the receipt so they will not pay. The food and drinks receipts we submitted were not itemised so they will not pay. The accommodation receipt did not have a date stamp on it (even though it was dated the 14th August the day after we should have gone home) so they will not pay. Easyjet flight cancellation actually cost us £289.00 and they have agreed to reimburse us £20! Not only did they treat us like animals and leave us stranded at Gibraltar airport with nowhere to stay, but when we claimed our valid expenses they have done everything in their power to wriggle out of paying.

There was the option to buy hold luggage which was more expensive as the cost started from around £20. Failure to comply will result in forcing a passenger to pay extra £24 for each cabin bag.

The main reason of my complaint now is this appalling, cheap and relentless baggage policy they have. Not being able to bring an overhead cabin luggage without paying extra for it is disgusting. It serves no purpose besides scamming your customers and making the check in less efficient, since a lot of unaware people have to pay 29 euros before boarding to get in the plane, and the suitcase goes to the hold and not even with you on board.

Only a small wheel got past the metal box, as deserted as the plane was and given the situation they could have clearly arranged a place for my baggage.

I am filled with so much rage ,anger and even sadness. The way she spoke like I was some insignificant number, just another dumb client enraged me to the depths of my soul.

Now after over 40 emails making this request and speaking to sales reps I am denied the refund. I conveyed all this information plus the fact that I have moved to a country that Easyjet does not have flights and was told that they will not do anything to change the situation and give me a refund.

Since the cancellation of our British Airways flights, I have trying to get in contact with easyJet, to let them know, that there is no conceivable way we can get to Glasgow by the 21st August. All attempts to contact easyJet have been unsuccessful. After two hours of being on line with their customer care line listening to the stupid ring tone, I realised no one was on the other line. I tried their facebook, twitter and email accounts, but could get no response at all. Earlier this year, the easyJet website clearly stated that change fees will be waived due to the pandemic, as long as the changes occur 14 days prior to the scheduled flight. When trying to change the flights tonight (14 days prior to the scheduled flight), however I was charged 228 GBP for the change fee. Please keep in mind that the original flight cost was only 192 GBP. I find this unacceptable.

When I informed the customer service rep that they are acting unlawful stating this and my parents may have to ask their bank to charge back the refund from Easyjet, he said ""if your parents do that, they will then owe Easyjet the cost from the banks chargeback and will not be able to fly with Easyjet again""! With an attitude like that Easyjet do no deserve to come out the other side of this successfully and carry on being able to operate. I was flabbergasted.

I explained the situation to the customer service desk and I was told that the next one from Bristol to Lisbon would only be on Thursday (this happened on Monday). I couldn’t stay in Bristol for that long, it was impossible; there were other flights to other two Portuguese cities the next morning, but they weren’t feasible either, since I had to invest more time and money. I had no idea what to do. I begged for alternatives, asking which was the nearest airport to Bristol and when would be their next flight to Lisbon. The senior manager suggested me to go to Gatwick, since the next flight to Lisbon would be the next day in the afternoon. London seemed reasonable, so I accepted. I couldn’t believe when I was told that all costs, from the taxi to the hotel, would be covered by easyJet. Not only did they book and paid a 2 hour and a half trip from Bristol to London, I stayed in a 4-star hotel in Chessington with dinner and breakfast covered. My flight from Gatwick to Lisbon was also arranged by them. All in all, I am deeply thankful for such prompt assistance, offering to cover these costs and overall turning this nightmare into a good experience.",positive,0.326815,0,25

Our flight was over 5 hours delayed due to an air traffic control strike which we were informed about whilst on the plane already 2 hours delayed. We were originally booked on British Airways and they cancelled the night before, which means EasyJet would have known about the strike at the same time and failed to act accordingly (notify us or tell us there would be a delay). We were kept outside in the cold waiting to board for 30 minutes before the plane was ready, then we were kept on the plane for 4 hours without any refreshments and not letting us disembark to stretch our legs. Then we were let off the plane into the gate to buy some food, which we had to pay for ourselves and not given any vouchers. Finally, we were let back onto the plane and took off almost 6 hours after the originally scheduled take-off time. They then provided us each with a soft drink and bag of crisps - hardly something sustainable for a delay of over 6 hours. The pilot told us that they should not have treated us like this and urged us all to file a complaint and ask for compensation due to the fact that the airline failed to inform us of the strike prior to boarding/delays. The crew told us that we could not get off and refuse to take the flight if we wanted to receive compensation so we felt stuck in this regard. I filed a EC261 Compensation Claim and was rejected within less than 24 hours due to the fact that it was an ""extraordinary circumstance"" due to the air traffic control strike. The circumstances were already known 24 hours before they told us. I fully expect to be compensated.",negative,-0.731312,0,25

The lounge and service is good as there are sufficient selection of food, snacks and drinks available. They also call when boarding is starting and the lounge is located very close to the Amsterdam boarding gate. The boarding process on easyJet is by priority (speedy boarding), but you need to make sure that you are ready as it is difficult to get overhead space to put your hand baggage if you are not ahead of the queue.

No delays, no canceled flights, professional and friendly crew - quite often with a good sense of humor. The prices are super competitive and they also part of an exchange now to make flying more friendly for the environment - already included in the ticket price.

On arrival at the gate I found there was a long queue into the ‘room’ where final boarding card and passport checks are carried out. Passengers were queueing out of the room and up two flight of stairs. There were signs for ‘speedy boarding’ but these were utterly pointless due to the overcrowding in the stairwell - the only staff on hand (who should have been marshalling this situation) were staff telling people that their hand luggage would have to go in the hold as the overhead lockers would be too full - fortunately this didn’t affect me as the staff started this process well behind me at the back of the queue, which then started moving. On arrival into the room and managed to fight my way through to the speedy boarding lane - I was naturally the last person in this queue. When we boarded the aircraft I then found that there was no space in the overhead lockers anywhere near my seat (1B), mostly because they were full of hats, coats, handbags, scarves and other items which, if the cabin staff had any sense and were in any way proactive about the situation, could have been put under the seat in front. At the insistence of the particularly unhelpful male cabin crew member, I had to place my hand luggage, for which I had paid extra, in the overhead lockers about 10 rows back on one side and the other item about 13 rows back on the other. I asked him if he would be retrieving them for me on departure to which he replied ‘no, I won’t be getting them’ - I already knew the answer and I knew equally well that this would mean that I would either have to fight my way upstream to retrieve them on landing, or wait for the entire aircraft to empty before going back to get them, which is the option I took which meant that I was the last passenger to leave the aircraft...from seat 1B - absolutely ridiculous.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to London,20-Jan,3,3,,,,1,1,no,1," I had a poor experience today flying from Zurich to London this morning at 9:30 local time. I have also flown a few times with a small backpack (to put under my feet) and a carry on luggage no problem with other airlines. The counter staff seemed unsympathetic at all and was pressuring me to just pay the CHF 76 and move along, standing in front of me just saying that it was impossible that all the stuff would fit (when I was trying to put the stuff from the small bag to the larger one.) She even went as far as to suggest to me and another family that we won't be allowed to test the luggage dimensions again and just to pay the 76 francs. (That's nearly as much as the ticket itself!) Even, when I did manage to fit the small suitcase into the slot, she said that it had to be smooth fit and that it couldn't be squeezed in. I have never expected such strictness and unreasonable behaviour from airport staff before and I can only believe it was out of spite that she said this as she realised that I had actually been able to fit the backpack into the carry on suitcase. I even saw her pressure the other family to pay just because they had an iPad that was not in the carry-on. When I got on, there was more than enough space in the overhead lockers and I had intended to put my backpack under my feet in any case to save space. In the end, I was forced by the same staff member to throw out my slippers as again she claimed they were an additional item of luggage. Seriously? All it did for easyJet, in the end, was that there was no way I would pay such a money-grabbing 76 francs and it didn't solve their issue of overcrowded luggage as the now larger suitcase was taking up more space in the overhead compartment than if I had 2 separate ones, 1 above and the small backpack underneath my feet. All in all, I believe this to be an extremely frustrating experience for both myself and easyJet as a company which could have been much better handled with more reasonable and less spiteful staff members who could have been more professional with the way they handled customers.

We followed the website protocol and booked 3 bags into the hold. We were well below the (combined) baggage allowance but preferred to play it safe rather than have hassle at the airport. Equally, none of us had wheelie suitcases but the kids and my husband had little rucksacks while I took a bag that fitted into the under-seat dimensions. As a result, we had no issues at the gate. On the return flight, they were asking everyone at the back of line, where we were, with wheeled luggage to check it into the hold but they looked at our bags and said 'that's fine'. I think that you just need to follow the rules with easyJet if you want a pleasant experience. Other than that, the flights themselves were great. Friendly pilots, very friendly cabin crew and an efficient service. We had onboard snacks and drinks and they were all very good. I don't think they were overly expensive but another time, we might take our own snacks to save a bit.

At Seville Airport it turned out that I was the only passenger whose luggage was lost. All my sports holiday plans were ruined on the first day. I was able to adjust them for the short-term but they managed to ruin it twice. At the airport (I arrived at ~11am), I was assured that necessary forms were filled in and I should receive all further communication by email. I’ve waited for some time - got nothing. Had to go online and manually fill in all the forms again; only after that I’ve got the first email saying “We’ll send you regular updates via SMS and email”. Since that email I have received no info by emaill/SMS in two days and had to call a few times a day to get some info, and every single time repeating all my details. Until 8pm I was not even sure if my luggage was located. Finally they’ve found it at Luton airport. No info by email/sms. Someone at the call center told me that the bag is scheduled for a flight on Day 3 and should be in Seville at 11am. Day 3: I’ve called easyjet early morning to figure out if the bag will be delivered today. Throughout the day, three people at easyjet provided me with certainty that the bag will be delivered today to my hotel in the afternoon, “certainly today”. I was a fool to trust them again one can judge. If they could only inform me that they cant guarantee a certain day of delivery - I would have come to the airport myself and collected my stuff, without which I was stuck in a Spanish village with almost nothing to do as all my holidays were dependent on my sports equipment. Easyjet turned out to be  liars as the luggage has not arrived that day. Also, only after my complaint about no communication - they did send another update, after more than 48 hours. Day 4 At 8am I reached the call renter again and a person there told me completely different info, that they have handed my bag over to the delivery center and can’t guarantee time of delivery. Why on Earth have not his colleagues told me the same info the day before?! All of them were assuring me to expect the bag in the hotel on Day 3. I was redirected to the local airport for more information. I’ve been trying to call them for 3 hours (was even wondering if this was a holiday in Spain?). Only at 11am someone picked up and told me that I should not call every day to them, and they already handed over my bag to the delivery company and no longer have info on that. I asked them to provide me with the phone number of the delivery company so I can track my bag and they were not able to provide it. I felt completely lost, miserable and helpless to be honest. At 2pm I received email which stated that the bag was delivered - it was NOT. I felt they were kidding me. Called them again - they have informed that the bag should be with me at 5pm.

We were told nearing Bristol that the weather was poor and the pilots did attempt to land but there was a lot of turbulence so they chose to move onto Cardiff airport. The outcome was a short stop at Cardiff to refuel during which the weather improved at Bristol and we eventually landed at our destination about 3 hours late. All through, the flight and cabin crew (Antonio was cabin manager) kept us informed and were calm and encouraging - dealing with a poorly passenger and someone who was stressed, 22 passengers who chose to get off at Cardiff and a subsequent security check of the plane.

My friend and I were preparing to board the plane, she had a purse like bag and her cabin bag and they said nothing about that but I queued with the exact same size of bag and was told I had to open my suitcase and make it fit in, as my suitcase was very full I couldn’t fit it and didn’t understand the issue as my friends were ok. The staff member blocked us at the door and began demanding £50, yet other passengers on the plane were carrying laptops, suitcases and various other items and my friend had the exact same bag. Another staff member then joined her and began causing a scene and refusing to let us on the plane, pointing her finger and generally being nasty. This was very off-putting with being a regular easyJet customer. Although I cannot fault the staff on board, they were extremely helpful.

I’ve had an operation on my Achilles tendon and, after 6 weeks in plaster, I’m currently wearing a surgical boot. I use a ‘knee walker/scooter’ to get around but mobility is restricted nonetheless. I was a little apprehensive prior to my trip to Kraków but I shouldn’t have worried. EasyJet and their airport services partners (OCS in Bristol and Welcome in Kraków) meant the trip went like a dream. I was assisted at every step throughout the airport process - from check-in, through security, up to the gate and finally on to the aircraft. On arrival in Kraków I was met by the Welcome team who not only helped me off the aircraft, into the terminal and through immigration, but escorted me to the railway station and put me on a train to the city centre. The whole process was replicated on the return journey. We often read criticism of easyJet and their ilk but I really think that people very often only write about their bad experiences. So I just want to balance the scales a little and present a ‘good news’ story. I had a wonderful time in Kraków, helped in no small part by easyJet and their partners.

After letting other women with totes and carry ons walk by she picked me out and asked me to open my carry on, put my tote in it, close it and fit it into the carry on size check boxes. My carry on is sold under description it  says allowed on EasyJet flights. When i did what she asked me to do my suitcase fit but i couldnt bend and lift the carry on again. When I asked for help she said she would come but made me wait until almost everyone had boarded. I asked her why she was being so mean to me while letting everyone else walk by with same or more luggage. No response. Instead of helping me she walked back to the line and boarded more passengers. At the end it was a kind young female passenger that helped me lift the carry on out of the size checking bars. She also commented on the employee's rudeness.  Because I was late in boarding despite having paid extra for a front row seat, my carry on ended up being stored 20 rows behind me. It will be fun finding it after landing. It is not that she asked me to check what is a standard rule at EasyJet but that she did not ask other with same or more weight to do the same so I was arbitrarily picked by her. I wish I had other choices when flying out of Bristol but Easyjet is my only option. I would really appreciate the company providing some common sense and empathy training to their customer-facing employees and ensuring that their rules are standard for all passengers, not just those an employee arbitrarily selects.

Priority boarding seems a little more exclusive as it should be.

Crew was unfriendly and everyone who understood Dutch could listen to the purser and 2 crew members when they started complaining about the ground staff, about passengers etc - they really did not care at all.

The crew did a great job attending to him but then decided that we had to divert to Gatwick so that he could go to hospital.On landing he transferred to an ambulance and my friend and I had to accompany him to Redhill hospital while the flight continued on to Majorca. After spending 5 hours with our cases he was discharged but told that he could not fly with his condition. As we had to get back to Liverpool we decided to go back to the Easyjet desk at Gatwick to see if they could advise us how we could get back home. After explaining our dilemma to a wonderful young lady, she who arranged a taxi for us to get home which involved a 500 mile round trip for the driver. She then supplied us with two tickets from Manchester to Palma the next day for two of us to continue our holiday. When I asked how much I would have to pay she said that Easyjet would foot the bill.

Bag size and weights are generous, with people sometimes trying to break the rules and bring more than one cabin bag on board. I was unable to find any locker space on the plane which meant I could put my bag under the seat in front, however, some may not be so lucky especially those boarding the plane last! Overall I was impressed flying with them. The plane was their new A321 Neo aircraft - nice clean plane with comfortable leather seating (no recline, however), lots of legroom for someone like me who is quite tall. There was good space under the seat in front, however, be aware that you might find the seat width a bit weird on this aircraft because they are more narrow than usual so be prepared to rub shoulders with other people! There are actually 2 sets of toilets at the back of the plane (I don't think there are any at the front). I was sitting as part of a group in row 36. Overall I had a pleasant experience.

I was very disappointed by one of the crew members of my Easyjet flight to Naples on 13th of October 2019 (flight n. EZY325). I’ve been told, rudely, that there was no more space for my small luggage and had to drop it. I gently explained that I needed the luggage with me because every minute was on the count as I was flying for a home emergency and couldn’t waste time at the airport once in Naples. She kept saying “there’s no space sir”. Then I raised, saying “My dad is dying, and I can’t wait for my luggage. Please just let me keep this with me.” She said “No, there’s no space. Just doing my job.” I’m not here to contest her arrogance, but there was not even a small track of empathy with my request. Like trying to understand the situation and at least try to find a little solution. Even because I’ve seen other people after me with some big bags or small luggage coming to the cabin. So I don’t understand the fact that was no space left. I found this very upsetting and disrespectful. This shows a completely poor attitude and a huge lack of moral and lack of professionality and lack of passion from the crew member. She might have had a tough day, maybe she was already on her second/third flight on her shift, but still: you get paid for it. It’s your job, not mine. And this is not an isolated case for Easyjet cabin crew, or in general low-cost companies. And I arrived at the conclusion that it’s sad to see tired members of staff not being focused on the customer needs but just on the Company business sides’ how to make more money “squeezing” us like limes. By the way, just for the records, even though the flight was itself late 40 minutes, I spent 20 minutes for my luggage and went home then couldn’t say goodbye to my father.",negative,-0.766267,0,24

We simply rearranged our luggage to comply, not being trusted that we would not reconfigure our now one suitcase and one backpack back to the original state with the same content, said jobsworth tried to check in the suitcase, with some protest she backed down. I would not mind but this was a completely arbitrary process that some suffered, others didn’t. Otherwise, you’re typical EasyJet experience, lost luggage before we even took off, causing delays, with everyone having to identify their hand luggage. cramped seating, pricy yet reheated foul food (although I didn’t purchase, seeing what others had, I wouldn’t), staff with a chip on their shoulder.

I traveled with this suitcase all over the world with low cost airlines and never had a problem. Many other customers had same sized suitcases and they were not asked to measure it. As a tall man I feel already penalized enough in terms of seating space and because my clothes simply take more space, so I, at least, demand that either all suitcases are measured or they give me my money back. I suspect that as I was one of the last passenger in line, they realize that they have not enough space to fit all the luggage in the compartments and they just give it a try, even though all other measurements where well bellow the limits. Also the person checking my suitcase didn't show any sort of emotions: I am used to customer oriented airlines where the staff cares about their customers, this is not the case for easyjet. With 50 pounds extra, this airline is fare away from being competitive and next time I will pay 5 pounds more in order to fly with a reputable airline or take the bus.",negative,-0.828868,0,24

My flight was delayed for 3 hours and 30 minutes. The explanation of the delay was due to weather conditions in the city of departure (Barcelona). In fact, it was raining in the morning by afternoon it was slightly cloudy and other planes were departing on time from Barcelona. I was trying to contact the airlines by phone but it was not helpful at all. No response. Online chat button did not work and moreover, it is only available till 8 pm. During the waiting time, a representative of the air company offered the passengers a voucher for only 4 euros (a meal is much more expensive in the airport). Furthermore, the information about the vouchers was on their website an hour before they really started distributing them. The most important that I was not able to be on time at a railway station in Paris because I needed to go by train to another city in France. Being a student and having a limited budget I lost the money spent on my train ticket. The captain was very weird saying that our flight would last 1h and 35 minutes but then he said he would expect in Paris by midnight (considering the new departure time of 21:35). In fact, we started moving at 21:56 only. I’ll apply for EC261 and hope they will refund me money. I understand that it is a low-cost but anyway timing is always important.",negative,-0.763543,0,24

She was intentionally obstructive and unhelpful. I explained my wife was busy buying something we has not packed for our trip. The easyjet staff member could have offered to put out a PA address to call my wife but no, she was never going to be that helpful. Instead she rather just ran off a standard speech that the flight is not delayed and that I needed to go and find my wife. Once we had checked into the boarding area there were all sorts of pa announcements calling for late passengers. After this a PA announcement came stating the pilot was delayed in arriving so the flight was indeed delayed. I would like to give Easyjet a big fat zero for this customer service.

We contacted easy jet to be told they had over booked our seats. The only option they gave us was to turn up at 4am of the morning of the flight and see if people didn’t show up, they may arrange another plane but that wasn’t a guarantee either. We felt our only realistic option was to book another flight for my husband and I as the likely hood of people not turning up for a flight in the school holidays was unlikely and likewise with easy jet putting on another plane. We spoke to easy jet about this and had to pay again! So we paid £275 each return originally and then the new flight out because they over booked and wouldn’t guarantee anything cost £150 each. To say I am disgusted with the airline is an understatement. To not exchange our outbound flight for free as they over booked our seats that we paid for months before is beyond as is leaving clients with very little alternatives than to either cancel the holiday or re book flights. Before now I can honestly say we have never had a problem with the airline, but to do this to customers shows how little they care. A very disappointed customer.",negative,-0.737076,0,24

I never received a text message or an email warning me of the delay. Shouldn't I receive it? Apart from that, the flight finally started with 2 hours and 51 minutes of delay ... so not only the long wait but neither the compensation that starts from 3h. However we arrived at the airport in Cagliari at midnight. Deserted airport. We go to the car rental to pick up the car we previously booked but the car rental was closed. We looked for someone from easyJet to ask for help but at that time the airport was deserted. Having no other choice we took the taxi that took us to our accommodation where the next day we had another wedding (always work). The taxi cost us 120 euros. I sent the request for reimbursement of at least the taxi since no one will repay us for all the inconveniences attached to this delay ... but at least the out-of-pocket expenses. I respond that repayment is not possible. It seems absurd to me. The airline no. Does he reimburse the only means of transport available at that time at Cagliari airport? And what was I supposed to do sleeping at the airport? All this is absurd. The customer care is non-existent and assistance in case of problems also.

We then had to leave one overhead-sized carry on to be stored below. That was what we wanted to begin with, but we had to drag it through a busy airport first. The big issue for us is that some people were charged for stowing that extra bag (€60) when others were not. This was after they were told to take those bags to the gate.

As a very regular flyer particularly with this airline I believe my opinions are fair and well grounded. Taking at least two flights a week every week, this airline has become very unreliable in 2019. Constant delays of evening flights being announced before 10am the same day. This Friday I faced yet another 3 hour delay, I hear all those saying claim, but this doesn't return the time lost and away from my family. What it does do though is add an expensive £50 taxi fare with other transport options closed at 2am. So, the moral of my story is, with a very delayed Friday the night prior I contacted easyJets plus and flight club that I have membership of hoping that I might be permitted to move my 9pm Sunday flight to an earlier option. I advised of the issues, very politely I add, the day before asking simply to take the plane 50mins earlier. Sure £100 plus was the reply, so this is from an airline that has over £5k of my money in flights booked through to march 2020, zero empathy, zero flexibility advising turn up early and take your chances like everyone else. So flight club and plus membership, let alone loyalty stands for absolutely nothing. Never once have I submitted an eu261 claim for the countless late arrivals and multiple taxi fares.

We have been satisfied with easyJet in the past but the return trip this time was delayed 2 hours and all we got was an insincere apology. They could at least have offered everyone a free drink. We also wonder why it is that the departure gate at Luton is always so far away from the terminal building. This time we had to walk to the farthest of 16 gates while only one of the other gates along the way was in use. The speedy boarding option offered by easyJet is worth the price as it avoids long queues. It is also possible to book seats with extra legroom, providing all passengers are over 16. Of course, the price adds up and if you pay for hold baggage as well it can cost as much as a regular (not cut-price) airline. For us, the convenience of flying from Luton makes this worthwhile.

It's the fact you cancel after 4 hours. Really? It takes you 4 bleeping hours to figure out you can’t take off? This may have been acceptable when you were low cost but considering the creeping fares and the bogus charges this doesn't fly anymore.,negative,-0.830105,0,24

They sent us emails and text messages apologizing and assuring us that they would refund the flight ticket and our expenses. So after booking myself a bus to go from London to Marseille I logged in onto their website and applied for the ticket refund and applied for the expenses refunds.

I am amazed by the total lack of service and could understand their behaviour if they would pay a full refund for any delay, even a 2 minutes one.

We arrived for our flight, been through security checks, all the normal procedures and then proceeded to wait around for 4/5 hours for our flight - our flight was announced cancelled. We went to the information desk and asked what to do next and we’re pointed out of the waiting lounge to the EasyJet desk. We stood in a queue of about 200 people, all upset, and waited a good 30 minutes before being told how to rebook flights. There were only two members of EasyJet staff tending to the 200+ passengers with cancelled flights, one employee on the customer service desk and one handing out leaflets. We managed to get a free hotel for the night with a dinner and breakfast and rebooked a flight for the next day. Theyhotel was mediocre, the food was awful!  The next day we arrived for our flight, again 4/5 hours to spare. We got through security checks etc, and as soon as we got through to the waiting area our flight was delayed by an hour. It was then delayed further, and then delayed again and again. We waited for an extra couple hours and to our surprise we were given a gate to go to! We rushed to the gate, waited there for about 20 minutes, we were then told we had to wait for our flight to land and passengers to get off. We proceeded to wait. We watched the plane land, the passengers get off, bags being unloaded. Flights were taking off all around us. After watching all of this, everyone was getting agitated. Many people were surrounding the gate desk, asking what was happening. No one was getting a straight answer. Later we were told our flight was yet again cancelled for the second time. We then had to wait again for buses back to the baggage area. We made it back to the EasyJet desk with a queue of about 100+ people, all angry and upset. We waited for an additional 20 minutes before someone come out to speak to the passengers. One man at the front of the queue was very angry and started to raise his voice so the manager and employees walked away, back to the staff room I presume, and refused to speak to anyone because of one angry passenger raising his voice. We were left waiting in a queue with lots of agitated passengers so me and my partner left. If there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s to never use easyJet again.

I was left stranded in Zurich near midnight (not familiar at all with Zurich) and told to figure out how I would get to my destination on my own. Here is the text from them: We're sorry that your flight has diverted to Zurich airport. This is due to the closure of Basel airport. The disruption is beyond our control and is considered an extraordinary circumstance. We're very sorry but due to high demand in Zurich we are unable to arrange onward transport for you. If you’re able to make your own arrangements, we will refund the cost. Please retain all your receipts in order to make your claim. If you need any further assistance please speak to one of our ground crew in the airport who will be happy to help you. Note ""if you are able to make your own arrangements"" and ""one of our ground crew in the airport... will be happy to help you"" I found one of the ground crew and kindly asked them for help. They told me ""go catch a train"" (I remained very polite since I know it isn't their fault). I asked them where the train station was and if they could help me figure out which train .. they stated just walk straight and turn left you will see a train station (that is all they would say or do, I was left in shock) They offered no other assistance. I found the airport train station and because it was late at night no one was working there. I had to go to the automatic ticket machines. After struggling for 15 minutes I found out that to get to Basel I would have to take two trains and one bus, all of this in the middle of the night in a place I am unfamiliar with. Why couldn't they have at least given us a map and a guide to which trains we would need to take? This could have been very easy for them to print out and offer. When I arrived at Basel (after 2:00 am) I was informed that a KLM flight who was in the same predicament as my easyJet flight - diverted to Zurich., told their passengers to wait and when the storm moved past... flew them on to Basel. I would avoid this airline at all costs, they don't really care if you make it to your destination nor do they care about your  safety. I am still struggling to understand how they can drop you off in a different place and do nothing to help you get to your intended destination.

He had a very angry look on his face and said we have enough time to talk later. A lot of passengers made comments to each other, including the two passengers sat next to me, at how we had been spoken to. Now I fully understand that the safety briefing is extremely important and from time to time the cabin crew have to be firm with passengers to get their attention, but there is a difference between being firm with customers and being angry/aggressive. After takeoff, most of the passengers sat quietly for the duration of the flight to Amsterdam as they felt like they had been “told off”. In future, I think some crew members need to think about the tone they are using towards customers and drop the attitude!

Aircraft was spotless inside and Edinburgh based crew were friendly and welcoming to everyone. Comfortable window seat, decent leg room as I’m 6”1, didn’t feel claustrophobic on this full A320. Much better than the A319 on the Glasgow-Schönefeld outbound on the Thursday where I felt squashed in the window seat. Even though the boarding looked slow at the terminal side, this was completed quickly and soon we were on our way. Service was quick to commence and a reasonable selection of products available onboard. I had prepaid for a bistro voucher so took advantage of the hot meal deal which todays hot selection was the Ham and Cheese Croissant. Hot all the way through, and sufficient for an early evening snack along with a chocolate bar and Earl Grey Tea. Also had a few G&T’s which was perfectly reasonable in terms of price, €14 Remember, these are served as double measures. About 3/4 of the way through the flight I went to pour my last gin when realised that during the trash run, I gave them the full bottle of gin rather than the empty one! So while heading to the back to the toilet, I had a laugh with the crew mentioning what I had done. To my surprise, one of the crew opened the recycling bag and had a quick check to see if the full bottle was amongst the trash. I did not expect that, and we had a laugh about it. No luck, which I assumed. During decent, the cabin manager was making her was from the back, stopped at my row and handed me over a g&t, they had found the full bottle, yet it was too dirty to hand back, so gave me a fresh one. That was well above what I expected! Landed 20mins ahead of schedule, as always lovely views coming into Edinburgh, but the time saved was ruined due to airport ground traffic and being bussed to immigration. Not easyJet’s fault.

Instead of removing them from the plane or at least moving them to the rear, this family was moved to row 2 before they even attempted to move me, who was right behind this row. They weren’t even going to move me until my friend asked if there were more seats. The flight attendant tried to move us to the seat next to the vomiting child.

Flight arrived late, late announcement of gate at 1.35 but boarding same kept same 1.40, announced that gate closing, gave 5 minutes to come a long distance to gate 112, arrived gate at 1.50, boarding wasn’t started and plane just arrived. - Representative checked boarding pass and said £50 extra charge for each item that is not in the carry-on including laptop, iPad, jackets, personal purse, vanity, medications. Tried to put all of the items in carry on bag for all 4 passengers. In order to avoid paying £50 for each person, threw away two personal bags and stuffed all in checked in bags. Laptop, iPad, money bag and jacket was left in one personal bag. Representative insisted to stuff  all in 1 carry on because no personal items allowed. I showed her the board outside the boarding area, which says allowed personal items, she said, ""the board is not applicable to my ticket"". EasyJet was my connecting flight. We started with the same carryon on WestJet Airlines from Los Angeles to Calgary to Gatwick. Same carry-on with personal items was okay with WestJet but wasn’t okay with EasyJet. Representative said each airline has their policy. I charged £50 to my credit card and told her that easyjet will get 4 bad reviews today, she said, ""nothing she could do"". Now I’ll have to go to baggage claim for the one of the carry-on's that were checked in, which will delay my plans in Paris. I was in my seat at 2.25 pm, flight left the gate at 2.45 pm, take off at 3.10 pm (instead of 2.10 pm). Landed in Paris at 5.10 pm (instead of 4.10 pm). Baggage took 30 minutes to arrive at baggage area. Uber ride started at 6.10, overall 1.5 hours lost. I’m sure there is no penalty to EastJet for delays because we all sign fine print agreement upfront that says ""airlines are never wrong and they will pay nothing for customer inconvenience"". Airlines inside were okay, food offered at reasonable cost, water was available at cost. Of course no Entertainment. It was cold and no blankets or pillows were provided. Thank goodness I took out my jacket from the checked in bag. No announcement to apologize for delay in departure or arrival to Paris. I may have saved £50 when I booked my tickets but ended up paying that back to EasyJet, airline found an easy way to make money. Is there any governing body that could punish bad and intentionally fraudulent practices by airlines like EasyJet? I’m not sure if my review will make any change in EasyJet’s behavior towards their customers. Don’t they know flight will depart late, boarding will be late because it arrived late? If yes, why did they announce at 1.35 that the gate is closing and made us run? I’m sure many customers felt the stress and pain due to EasyJet’s unprofessional behavior and bad communications with customers. Considering my experience, I’m not going to fly again with EasyJet. There were other customers at the gate explaining similar issues, I’m sure they wouldn’t fly and give bad reviews. All my friends will stay away from EasyJet. Frankly, I’ll be very surprising surprised to see EasyJet’s existence in next - 4-5 years unless something changed I their behavior.",negative,-0.764363,0,24

This group on Wed 12th June quite literally prowled up and down the line, totally ignoring the people themselves who they simply dismissed if they asked what was going on and why they weren't allowed to take the luggage allowance specified on their ticket onto the plane, just pointing at bags they could try and force the passengers to pay extra for and dragging them to the front of the queue to put their bags in the size checker then engaging in screaming matches with people who refused to be bullied and threatening not to let them on the flights if they didn't leave the line and go to the back!

In booking with them for a flight to Sofia from Gatwick, I looked on line, and was pleased to see that they now included one cabin bag and personal item in the cost of their tickets, so I booked with them. I assumed that this was an attempt to compete with other discount airlines like Ryanair, etc. We checked in on line, and while waiting at the gate to board, there was an EasyJet employee going through the line and picking people out of the line and charging them a 50 pound fine for having an extra bag. She got a number of people as she did this and had a machine at the ready to charge our credit cards. When I protested, she said that our personal items were too big, and that I should have read the terms and conditions more carefully. How many people do that? Without being a member of their ""Easy travellers"" group, it was the same as always, and we were ""fined"" 100 pounds because our personal items were too large. Had we known, we would have factored that additional charge into the cost of our flight, and would have likely flown with someone else as the EasyJet flight was much more than other airlines with the additional baggage cost, and they flew at inconvenient times, and into the nasty, old disused terminal at Sofia Airport. If someone makes you pay an additional 100 pounds to board a flight you have already paid for, there is no name for it other than theft, fraud or extortion.

However, we weren’t aware that on the return journey this would mean we were part of the lazy crew’s party near the front of the plane. This activity all seemed to centre on friends they also had on the plane - and I know from a friend of my daughter that Easyjet staff can add anyone as family so we suspect high fares such as ours subsidise flights of any random person the crew might know. There was one guy in an EasyJet uniform who was a passenger but was sitting in the best seats in the house given lots of free food by his over attentive friend (before anyone else was served). Subsided again by paying passengers? Regular passengers such as we were overlooked (the guy at the end of our row was asked if he wanted anything but we weren’t). The crew later deny this but asking requires eye contact and a response. You’d think they’d want to sell their pricey refreshments but this crew were only eager to socialise with mates. They were banging against the barrier between us and them throughout the flight, carrying on so loudly we couldn’t hear through our headphones. People trying to get to the loo had to wait down the aisle. Complete joke. At the end of the flight the cabin manager made a jokey PA announcement thanking the crew for their hard work. He was laughing about it. You couldn’t make this stuff up. I laughed as well for different reasons - another crew member and the off-duty staff member sitting across our row immediately begin to challenge me so I told them the truth - no service and loud noise meant for a rotten flight. Well these guys didn’t like that and began denying everything. We held our ground and the off-duty guy became quite aggressive, almost shouting. On other airlines if a passenger did that they’d call the cops. The cabin manager told him to stop (in a far more polite way than he was speaking to us) and this off-duty guy loudly retorts that as he is a passenger he’ll do what he wants. I told him I wasn’t some weakling he could push around and at that point the pilot came out, ignored me and went to speak to my daughter- who was by now near the plane door and quite upset as she’s a nervous flyer and these lunatics weren’t helping. Pilot just said “Sorry for the inconvenience.” To quote the crew member when I told him I had video of their ‘party’ - “whatever”. Who trains these people? No one would be my guess. The off-duty guy laughed and carried on in the bus in front of us with his friends on the way back to the terminal - completely unaffected by his actions.

Apparently, people who pay 24 euros extra to choose their seat have priority in getting a seat on the plane over those who do not. So, since they overbooked the flight, I did not have a seat on the plane I paid for (and neither did my friend), but our other friend did and had to travel to Paris alone. A worker escorted my friend and I to a counter where we got a new reservation for a flight that was 5 hours later than our original flight. We did get a 9 euro voucher and ""speedy boarding,"" but overall a flawed system and do not recommend booking with EasyJet unless you want to pay 24 euros extra to choose a seat or want to run the risk of spending 10 hours (total) in the airport.

They do this after watching us struggle to put our items all in to one small cabin case. Why could they not have just let us wait till the end, and asked us to put our cases in the hold?

Our flight was cancelled the morning of our flight and after talking to the easyJet staff we were told no flights would be available for the next 2 days including the day that we were intended to fly. The strange part was that there were other easyJet flights flying out of the same airport the same afternoon just a few hours after our flight was cancelled due to a ""strike"". We had reservations and plans booked in Venice in advance for this trip so we needed to get to our destination. There is no travel insurance that will reimburse you for your cancelled flight unless the entire airport was shut down due to weather - that leaves it up the the airline. Travel insurance will also not reimburse you for costs incurred due to the cancelation and will not reimburse for reservations that were ruined as a result. There was no offered compensation or alternative option of travel offered by the airline. We were refunded the cost of our flight but that does not compare to that we needed to book tickets on an alternative airline which cost 9 fold. Pay 80$ now for a flight but pay 700$ at the door for an alternative flight. Thank you easyJet for this experience. Pay the extra money to book with a different airline and save yourself a headache. My mistake was not doing the research with this airline. I was told by others that last minute flight cancelation happens frequently with easyJet. After an awesome weekend on the Amalfi coast this airline experience really felt like a kick in the gut nearly made me just want to go home and end my vacation early.",negative,-0.496643,0,24

A report was made but we received no update at all until we called them. We luckily got our suitcase back after around 40 hours which we were grateful for. We do understand that these things happen, but the service was very poor throughout this. On our return in Amsterdam, the lady at the check in desk was probably one of the rudest people I have ever spoken to and it seemed like she went out of her way to make our journey harder. We were seeking advise for our case allowance as we had to buy more clothes due to us not receiving our luggage, and we were told completely different things by two EasyJet colleagues. One told us that we could pay for the hand luggage and combine the weight (costing 7€) but the lady on the desk told us we would have to pay 45€. We questioned this and they allowed us to put through the 7€ option once it was confirmed that we could do this.

✅ Trip Verified ,Airbu,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Gatwick,19-Mar,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Flights to and from Amsterdam from Gatwick booked weeks ahead and both journeys checked in before we left the UK. Not the cheapest flights available but economy. We arrive at the airport 2 hours before flying, in plenty of time, clear security easily and go to the gate area to wait for a specific gate. 10 mins before the scheduled departure another passenger notices that the departure time has changed from 19.45 (imminently) to 17.50, no other information. This causes other passengers to check their app to discover, then relate to us, that the flight has been cancelled. Not delayed, just cancelled, and that the 17.50 departure is the next day, Saturday. Savvy frequent flyers rushed off, knowing what to do, some even got alternative flights with other airlines. We were left standing with no information and no instructions what to do. There were no EasyJet staff on hand to explain, to offer suggestions or just tell us where to go. Eventually we found an information desk and they directed us back out to the Departures hall (back through the Baggage Hall and Passport Control) to the EasyJet check in guest where the other 150 or more passengers were waiting to find out what they were going to do. I waited in the queue for about 90 minutes to get to the front to be handed a piece of paper with the name of a hotel on it and the next day's flight details. It took them 30 seconds to give it to me. When I asked why they didn't just hand that out to the whole queue the poor desk staff, (who were not EasyJet staff just local airport representatives), said sorry the 40 rooms they had at the airport were full so we had to go back into town. So a train back in Amsterdam, a taxi to the hotel (which was very nice) but no meal as promised by EasyJet and by then the kitchens were closed. The next day our replacement flight is the last one out of Amsterdam, not the first or anything else during the day. The amazing thing is that there are no EasyJet people to talk to. None of the staff are theirs, not the check in or the gate staff. They know EasyJet are rubbish so they are practised at apologising. Don't fall for the cheap price, it's not worth it. The delays are inevitable, the cancellations random and the service non-existent. Pay a little bit more to know that when it does go wrong, as it will, there is someone there that can help you. The next day I had downloaded the app in order to check in on line. Using the flight tracker I could see the incoming flight from Alicante. Maybe the day before it came from somewhere else but the method is; plane comes in, offloads passengers then gets sent on somewhere else. The Friday flight was cancelled due to 'a staff welfare issue'.  Whatever, it must have been known about on the other flight, for some time, to allow then to make alternative arrangements for a spare pilot, 2nd officer, navigator?, cabin crew. But no, EasyJet don't do that because they care more about the bottom line than customer service. About 180 passengers on an A320 Airbus. Each passenger entitled to a minimum of 250 euro compensation plus hotel rooms, transfers, food etc, could cost them 63,000 as a conservative estimate for 1 cancelled flight. A lot more than the cost of one or two spare crew on standby. I learn today that Amsterdam is an EasyJet hub airport. But it doesn't matter to them, the only thing that matters is bums on seats. Don't pay, go somewhere else - change",negative,-0.664049,0,24

The outbound flight from Luton to Pisa, left on time and the boarding was slick, and professional, despite only having one set of steps in operation. Paying the small extra fee for speedy boarding meant we were able to take our carry on bags on board as the flight was full. Cabin crew operated a full trolley service just after we took off and an extra drinks service before landing. There were regular updates from the cockpit during the flight and a warning that it was going to be a 'tad' bumpy just after take off and we need not worry as the aircraft was going hit cold air has it climbed to its cruising height. Due to a tail wind we arrived in Pisa 90 minutes ahead of scheduled. The return flight into Gatwick was of a high standard and the cabin crew seemed very professional and exceeded customer expectations. Again the cabin service was slick and polished. Easy jet have now followed other airlines and allow you to pre order a meal (Hot or Cold) prior to booking and you are served prior to the main service, this is a good idea and worth every penny of the cost.",positive,0.727857,0,24

We tried 2 smartphones, and iPhone and a Samsung S8. No one worked. We reached the EasyJet desk as anxious about the issue. The employee at the desk advised us that the flight was ""overbooked"", and we were the first 2 passengers in overbooking. We booked and paid the tickets in November, and few hours before I got this brilliant news, and after that, the person at the desk said: I wish you luck. You might be able to board this flight. I used to work for an airline and I know how the system works with EasyJet, so I know that every flight has a no show percentage, but I do not expect to need to have luck to board a flight with a normal ticket, purchased more than 4 months ago. I had two options ahead of me: 1 wait till the end of the boarding even if I had a ticket already - 2 in case there was no seats available, getting a hotel room and wait time to be refunded, and leave the morning next. Both solutions were for me ridicolous as we are talking about tickets that I purchased more than 4 months before, considering the fact that I needed those tickets to get back home in Berlin. As I expected there were around 15-20 empty seats on board, but still I had to wait till the end of the boarding, so in the end I board the flight but still, this is unacceptable.",negative,-0.439713,0,24

My last flight I was asked politely if I could move seats as I customer had booked to fly with a large musical instrument, the crew found me a seat at the front of the aircraft. I’ve had a similar experience on BA and I have to say they were rude and told me I had to move and put me in a seat at the back of the plane! I’ve flown with many airlines around the world and even the best get it wrong sometimes, but I just felt that I was in safe hands with easyJet, they have a professional attitude and seem to be a willing to accommodate in a low cost world. They are a low cost airline and I’m sure passengers should remember that when they have 5* demands however that should never excuse poor customer service and unprofessional behaviour, on the flights I’ve received this year so far I’m happy report this was far from the case onboard easyJet.

My 76 year old wife was charged £48 because her cabin bag, which she has used for years and years had become 1"" too long, because Easy Jet decided to cash in by making a new ""rule"". They have done this, knowing full well, and in complete contravention, of the decision by the European Parliament's Committee, to now enforce a cabin baggage rule made in 2014. The European Court of Justice refers to airlines' varied size and weight standards for hand baggage, hidden fees, and misleading consumers about the true cost of air travel. The explanation given, was that the bag was a flight safety hazard, in the event of the aircraft being evacuated. However, by paying Easy Jet £48, the bag was no longer a flight safety hazard, apparently. The other explanation given was that it would not go under the seat, but would have to go in the overhead lockers, designed for that purpose. Which, of course, was exactly what always happened before Easy Jet changed their rules. Incongruously, prior to take off, cabin crew (quite correctly) ask for any significant items to be stored in the overhead locker. Now, if that isn't misleading and monetising customers, then I don't know what is. Easy Jet may seem like a cheap option. It isn't. If you have a problem, and there are often problems travelling, Easy Jet will do nothing to help you. Better, much better, simply fly with a reputable airline.

The wheelchairs provided in Hurghada airport are all broken & on arrival 3 weeks ago, I was dumped on a seat at the far end of the arrivals corridor & completely abandoned for 35 minutes, until the pilot & crew came past & asked if I was OK. I explained the situation & they kindly went to find a porter with another wheelchair to rescue me. The porters always demand a tip & often rummage through my purse, dictating to me which notes they will take for this 'free special assistance service', whilst also asking me for some of my painkillers, pens, sweets etc. The porters only provide a wheelchair service after you have queued to get into the airport, queued to have your passport check, queued to get through the first x-ray & bag/body searches, 2nd bag search & checked your bags in. They only wheel you to the gate, not down the gangways to the plane, so you are left standing in queues to board the plane for 30 - 45 minutes. My flight back from Hurghada on Sunday 26th May was delayed for over 26 hours & absolutely no special assistance was provided at all to disembark the plane, when the pilot decided to abort take off.

It is also infuriating that on every flight back to the UK from Hurghada, they never have any food. Only 7/10 flights to Hurghada have food available. I am diabetic & had arrived at Hurghada Airport at 6pm for my 8.45pm flight on Sunday. The 1st delay was apparently due to the plane arriving late from the UK. The 2nd delay was apparently due to a crew member being sick & the 3rd delay, was due to a technical issue with 2 of the 3 plane's communication systems as we were taking off. We were all sat on the plane, on the runway for over 2 hours, with no food or drink, only half a plastic cup of warm tap water each. We reached the hotel we were bussed to at approx 3.15am, but there was no food or drink available. All the restaurants were shut. The first opportunity to drink anything was from the minibar at 4.45am, once I had struggled alone to my room. Still, no food had been provided at all. I was feeling extremely unwell by then & tried to call Reception using the phone in the room, but it was broken. The next thing I remember was waking up at about 12.10pm. I struggled to get up & outside to try to find something to eat. Luckily, I came across a fellow passenger who escorted me to a restaurant for lunch. It was the fellow passenger who told me where the nearest pharmacy was & the rumour she had heard about a bus picking us up at 6pm. Arrived at the airport for our 10pm flight, which was delayed until 11pm. Again, no food on the flight. The excuses for flight delays are usually; pilot stuck on M25, crew sick, plane late in, technical issues, etc.",negative,-0.724085,1,29

They did one service after take off at break neck speed then disappeared. Apparently they were having dinner! How long it takes to have a ping dinner and a coffee appears to be at least 2hrs 30mins. They were visible individually when they took it in turns to make the long journey from the aft galley to the front galley only to sit down and read a book. Their attitude was quite unbelievable.

EasyJet has very restrictive luggage requirements, particular the minuscules dimensions permitted. In CDG Airport, the Terminal D is quite remote; it took me an hour to get there properly from T1, including busses, several passport, BP, and security checks, makes transit in Paris a hassle. Requirements for EasyJet to board early and check in baggage VERY early is, unnecessarily, very strict and scares people to waste a lot of time by being in gate area by far too early. Flight was delayed 1 hour. Information provided was sparse and unclear. Delays of ½ to 1 hour is more common on this route by easyJet.

In LGW during boarding a member of the ground staff immediately took out the POS machine to charge &48 per cabin bag, even though it did conform to their tight frame contraption. So without checking the bags, she tried to grab £48 per passenger. I think that easyJet has to look into this. In the end we were not charged as our bags did fit within their strict frame. Apart from their greedy extra charges for hand baggage attempt, I would say that easyJet is very very good.

As one of the first passengers at the gate, I observed an easyJet employee who appeared to be responsible for ensuring compliance with luggage policies. Unfortunately, his approach was marked by a level of rudeness that was quite disconcerting.

A passenger in the same row lay down and started to occupy the seat. Neither my son nor I were asked for consent or even informed of this action. All I could tell was a passenger who looked as though they were recovering from a heavy night and wanted a lie down to recover. To enable this, my son had to sacrifice their seat for an indefinite length of time. I raised my issue with the aircrew. My concern was passed between two cabin crew and escalated to their superior. I was told that as I'd momentarily vacated, I had to maintain this status quo and sacrifice my son's seat. No alternative was offered. No timeframe was given. The only option I was presented was for both my son and I to squeeze into the same seat. It transpired the situation lasted for the majority of the flight. The FAA states ""The safest place for your child ... is not in your lap"". Yet this is the situation I found myself in and had to try to explain to my son.

Bordeaux departure was mess, it says Billi L on the boarding pass, but who would know that that meant a shed at the end of the main terminal that was for low cost airlines - all the Departures signage coming from the hire car drop zone is to the main terminal in the opposite direction. At bag drop there was initially only 1 person sitting at a desk who was more interested in talking to colleagues rather than check in passengers' luggage. Then 2 more arrived and a panic to pull forward passengers travelling to Palma and Marseilles. The last member of our party was charged 45 euros for excess baggage despite having the same baggage as on the outbound flight. The rest of the boarding procedure was an equally overcrowded, hot and unpleasant experience. Why not use the main terminal, especially now it is about empty following France's partial domestic flight ban. Low visibility at Bristol resulted in an aborted landing followed by diversion to Cardiff.

My flight from Amsterdam to Naples was canceled about 30 mins before the departure time, without any prior notice whatsoever that there might be any problems. There were no easyJet staff available to explain what to do. Asking other passengers with previous experience of easyJet cancellations was the only option. I went to the easyJet desk in the baggage claim area but the staff did nothing to help the stranded passengers. Recovering my checked package took 2 hours.

Whilst bag-drop was straightforward and easy, getting through passport control was a total nightmare. At least a couple of hundred passengers were trying to reach the immigration booths at the B gates but were prevented by doing so by temporary barriers erected ostensibly to control the crowds but which instead resulted in passengers being kettled and trapped in scary conditions (i.e. risk of being crushed and little to no working air conditioning). One could argue this is the airport’s responsibility rather than the airlines’, but both Ryanair and jet2 sent their staff to the barriers to allow ONLY their passengers past the barriers; easyJet passengers were not allowed through and had to wait for other airline passengers to pass through and then slip through behind them whenever they could. EasyJet did not send down any staff to advocate for their passengers stuck behind the barriers and it was the most chaotic crowd I have ever seen waiting to be stamped out of any country. As a result, our flight was delayed by one hour simply because half of the passengers were still waiting to clear passport control (I overheard one of the ground staff confirm this to the cabin crew after I had been able to finally board). The flight itself was fine, but the experience at Naples airport was harrowing and it was upsetting to see how other low cost airlines bothered to get their passengers passed the barrier whilst easyJet staff were nowhere to be seen.",negative,-0.854276,1,28

On my last trip there's this staff member in LGW, not very presentable, checking the boarding passes - he asked many travellers to insert their baggage in a tiny space to verify the measurements; if it was half an inch bigger than that, then he tells the travellers that would be £48 extra charge.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Prague to Milan,23-Sep,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," From my understanding I booked a flight from Berlin to Milan the day before yesterday. Afterwards I received a confirmation email saying the flight departs in Prague and flies to Milan. After I saw that email I immediately called EasyJet's customer service which was more useless. First he told me that there are no flights from Berlin to Milan at all and that I cannot change my flights at all. When I advised him that the airport is called Milan LIN that EasyJet planes fly to from Berlin, he told me that it would be cheaper for me to just make a new booking as it would be cheaper. However, I would still have to pay for those wrong flights from and to Prague since the booking has been made more than 24 hours ago. I asked him if there are any exceptions because obviously there must be a mistake (and it's possible that this mistake was made by the airline, because why would I book a flight from Prague) but he told me there's nothing that he can do for me. I went online and changed the flights on the website myself. There is no option to change both flights (there and return) at the same time, so I had to pay rebooking fees twice. Moreover there were no suitable return flights available anymore that leave in the evening, so now I had to take one a day later and have to pay for another night at the hotel. All in total I've paid now close to $900 AUD for flights + extra night at the hotel in Milan for one short trip from Berlin to Milan and return, because most likely there is some sort of bug in the system (either skyscanner or easyjet). This is more than frustrating! I would have expected EasyJet to show some understanding for my situation and either let me cancel the wrong booking to find another airline that offers me the right flights at the right times or let me change the flights at no extra fees.",negative,-0.636926,1,28

Poor boarding management at Luton airport, however. Boarding was via stairs and those allocated to board at the rear of the plane boarded as normal whereas those allocated to board via the front stairs were made to queue for around 15 to 20 minutes, standing on the tarmac. Later I discovered by chance that this was to allow a disabled passenger to be loaded first. This is understandable (and I don't mind waiting for that reason) but the failing of easyJet was that they did not communicate this reason to us whilst we were standing in the queue, not knowing what was going on.

EasyJet's app was very good in keeping us up to date with the latest status / estimated times of the flight. The app alerted me to potential problems about 5 hours before the flight, when the air traffic control failure first began impacting flights. At one point it seemed as if we might be 4 hours delayed but in the end we were less than 90 minutes delayed, which was good considering how many other hundreds of flights were cancelled and thousands delayed. We were told to check-in at the usual time; there was no queue at the airport for baggage drop. Staff were friendly, though no explicit mention was made of the likely delays! Boarding was a little chaotic as it required buses to transport everyone from the terminal to the aircraft (so anyone with speedy boarding would have only have had a marginal advantage, if any). At this stage we were all just happy the flight was still going ahead.

We are a family of 4: 2 adults and 2 small children. It was impossible to find any alternative flight on the same day to the same destination with 4 free seats. The app also didn't find any available hotel. Spending a night in the airport with 2 small children is not an option. So we had to find another flight to another destination in another country and pay everything ourselves on the spot. That's not the biggest problem though. The problem is, EasyJet now does not want to take responsibility and reimburse the extra costs, as the circumstances were ""out of their control"".

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Milan to Gatwick,23-Jul,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," I am writing to express my deep disappointment and sheer frustration with the appalling service I experienced during my recent flight with EasyJet on 20th July 2023. My journey with your airline, on Flight EZY8312 from Milan Malpensa to London Gatwick, was an absolute nightmare from the very outset. To begin with, all the electronic check-in gates at Milan Malpensa Airport were either out of order or deliberately switched off, resulting in an infuriatingly slow and chaotic process. It was quite an ordeal to witness the incompetence of the ground staff, and to add to the misery, there was only one overwhelmed lady dealing with the needs of over three hundred passengers. It is beyond comprehension how an airline of EasyJet's stature could allow such a woefully understaffed situation to occur. Unfortunately, the frustration did not stop there. Upon reaching the departure gate, I was greeted with the distressing sight of an obviously intoxicated and vulgar man causing a commotion at the bar. It was abundantly clear to anyone with basic judgment that this individual was in no condition to fly. He then proceeded to wander around the terminal, rudely interacting with both staff and passengers, while attempting to light a cigarette. The potential safety risk he posed to everyone on the flight was glaringly evident, and I was utterly shocked to witness the inaction of the EasyJet staff in preventing him from boarding the plane. As time passed, the intoxicated passenger's behavior grew increasingly aggressive towards anyone who dared to approach him. Astonishingly, the gate staff checked him in without any regard for the safety of the other passengers, allowing him to board the plane despite the obvious risk he presented. I was among the last passengers to board, and the atmosphere on the plane was one of fear and discomfort as this individual continued to disrupt and behave aggressively throughout the flight. Only after an excruciating two-hour delay and numerous complaints from concerned passengers did the decision to call the police to remove the intoxicated man from the flight finally come about. This delay was further compounded by the lack of clear communication from your staff. Even the pilot expressed disbelief at how this man was allowed to board the plane in his inebriated state. The incident not only caused unnecessary distress to passengers but also created an unprofessional and unsafe environment that is wholly unacceptable. The apparent indifference of your staff towards the welfare of your customers and their failure to act promptly in such a dangerously evident situation is deeply reprehensible.",negative,-0.84771,1,28

The return flight was cancelled again (after our being on board for 2 hours) and a replacement flight was arranged on the following day (14 July). I could not afford that delay and took the Eurostar back. I understood that since I did not cancel the return flight I could not get compensated for it. But the onward flight had been a problem with the Airline. I filed for compensation and after 2 days got the message that I was not eligible for it because I did not travel on the flight. A cancelled flight and I was supposed to travel on it. I spent half an hour with an agent with capacity for inefficiency. She took fifteen minutes to grasp what I was looking for. And then she said the outbound flight was Delayed and Not Cancelled. I asked her why the board displayed Cancelled and whether the flight had taken off. She replied she could not say whether the flight had reached London or had taken off, but it was delayed for more than five hours and since I was not on it I was not eligible for a compensation.

We sat in the plane for another hour then the captain came back with the real reason why we hadn't moved - we are waiting on new cabin crew coming to the plane and we can't find them! They're in the airport somewhere so please bear with us! Really professional.  After 3 hours of sitting on the plane we were then informed that they have found the cabin crew. Cabin crew entered the plane to applause from everyone, however this little bit of joy was not too last. After 5 hours we taxied getting ready for take off then the plane engines stopped and we were informed that our flight was being cancelled!

They have no staff in the airports and will tell you to pay for your own expenses and claim back, which they will then deny. They have cost us thousands and haven’t been in touch with us at all. They’ve even blocked our social media comments.  We were supposed to return to the U.K. on the 23rd from Croatia, and so we headed to the airport for our flight from Split to Manchester. We sat for hours in the airport, and noted delay after delay. During the delays, we received no updates from staff, only learning of delays from the easyJet app by checking manually and we were given no food or water. It’s suggested that you should receive vouchers for the delay, but we never did and it would have gotten you a quarter of a bag of the cheapest chocolate from there anyway. Duty free was incredibly expensive and limited, as were the facilities. We sat there for hours and after lots of delays with no communication, easyJet cancelled the flight without notifying us and left everyone stranded in the airport with no help or guidance. The flight appeared as cancelled 40 minutes before the staff decided to make a tannoy announcement. You were left to rebook the flights through the EJ app; there were none for days and they booked up quickly so our group had to split and take whatever was available, paying for the hotel and other costs out of our pocket. The next direct flights weren’t for days, and the other flights were all connecting ones to various places across Europe (Amsterdam, Milan, Rome) etc and not only were they with huge layovers, there were not enough seats on any of them, and also experienced the problem of being during the following days. Our smaller group had taken the Croatia to Milan connecting flight option, as we had group members with limited medication and health issues which we decided were the most important people to get to the U.K. earlier. We were unhappy with all the travelling time but it was the fastest option back into the U.K and we would have been trapped abroad for weeks otherwise, rather than days, so we were left with little choice. As there was no contact from easyJet and the staff were unhelpful, we also had to find a hotel at 11:30pm at night and then also find a way to get to it. Due to the timings, we had no food or water, and no breakfast but due to the dwindling amount of supplies and money we had on us, we had to keep our morning flight to Milan without being able to access any clean clothing or supplies. We did contact our travel insurance but as it was nearly midnight they were closed, and the next day they were completely unhelpful too as they state it is an issue for easyJet to resolve first, so they cannot and would not help. We went through the airport as normal the next day, and boarded our flight.

✅ Trip Verified ,A321N,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Funchal to Lisbon,23-Jun,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Flight EJU7628 FNC-LIS was originally scheduled to leave at 22:00 on 02.06.2023 but was considerably delayed until 00:00 on 03.06.2023. The boarding staff at Funchal then informed that the flight had been cancelled. All passengers had already shown their boarding card and identification document. The boarding staff did not give any reason for the cancellation, only that they had just been informed. easyJet did not volunteer to send any messages during this hiatus. Legitimately outraged passengers shouted insults and kicked the easyJet queue separators. easyJet had a crew strike scheduled for 03.06.2023 from 00:00 but claims the ""delay"" [cancellation], was due to problems with the control tower, which is highly dubious because the TAP, Ryanair and SATA flights landed after the easyJet plane from Lisbon at 23:10 on 02.06.2023, without any disruptions. It was reported that easyJet had been transferring planes from European bases to Portugal with non-Portuguese crew, this combined with the strike in Portugal I believe was the real reason for the cancelation or delay, so the crew exceeded flight times. Despite appearing on the movement panel of Funchal airport as a cancelled flight, having in my possession and that I attach, photo with date and time watermark, besides the visible time on the panel itself, that the flight was cancelled. At this moment, abandoned at Funchal airport, I am forced to rebook a flight to Lisbon as soon as possible, which cost me an extra expense, inherent to easyJet's lack of professionalism, of 312.99 euros. Everything lead me to believe, with no room for doubt, that the flight was cancelled. Only at 01:30 of 03.06.2023, when I had already been forced to reschedule my trip due to easyJet's total lack of diligence, does easyJet send an SMS that the flight was rescheduled for 12:00 of 03.06.2023, 14 hours after the scheduled and original departure of the flight. easyJet did not provide the possibility to accept or refuse the rerouting, they only changed the booking and checked in by myself, without any consent, whether I accepted the new flight, wanted a cash or voucher refund. Under the terms of Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, of 11 February 2004, I am entitled to compensation for the 14-hour delay I suffered - if it is not correctly considered that this was an effective cancellation - to the value of at least 250.00 euros plus the expenses incurred with the need to rebook on the nearest flight (312.99 euros), since easyJet had not informed passengers until 1.30 am on 3 June 2023.

Surely, EasyJet would have checked with Naples airport that we were ok to land at the ETA to authorise departure. I'm sure that, where there's a risk of missing closing time by 6 mins as we were told, the considerate & reasonable thing to do would be to cancel the flight. I have reasons to believe that this was not done so that the incident could be marked as ""exceptional circumstances"", so that EasyJet could get away with not refunding passengers as per its refund policy. So either the staff was so naïve as to not consider that flights can miss closing time by 6 mins, or this was deliberate fraudulent behaviour. Either way, it was unacceptable. EasyJet kept us waiting 5 hours at the airport, before boarding us and only then diverting our plane. We were also promised that EasyJet would provide accommodation and alternative transport, only to find out after 2 hours' wait that no, this would not be provided and we would have to think for ourselves. I was going to Naples to attend a wedding, which I missed. I cannot think of anything that would repay me not only of the financial cost, but also the time waste (the whole trip took me 21 h), and the psychological stress the company has deliberately inflicted on me. It is appalling to see a company preferring the petty value of my £300 ticket to a longer-run customer satisfaction and good publicity.",negative,-0.756212,1,28

Eventually they told me I was not entitled to change the flights because they changed the flight by less than 3 hours.

The flight experience is comfortable and predictable, the crew are polite. The food available to purchase is excellent. Bags arrived quickly.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Luton to Edinburgh,23-Apr,3,3,,,,1,1,no,1," I am writing to denounce my profound regret regarding my flights with easyJet. Customers try to choose EasyJet because they are low costs but the hidden fees and the staff behaviour made me spend with easyJet really more than other airlines such as Air France or Lufthansa. I think that easyJet has many problems including the fact that a flight can only be changed for an important cost (£49) when it is within two months (who will book and change a flight before two months?). Hence the change would represent twice the price of the flight price. However, I am writing regarding a specific issue. Yesterday, I had two flights with easyJet, the first from Lyon to London Luton and the second from London Luton to Edinburgh. Three days before my flight I bought the right to have a large cabin bag (that cost me £47 for the first flight and £15 for the second one). Everything was OK with the first flight where I had my cabin bag with me in the cabin (where its place should be). However, in London Luton, the staff member at the check-in desk forced me to pay 48 additional pounds for the same cabin bag with a 10.9kg weight (in order to check it in as hold luggage). Please note that the same bag fitted really well on the plane for the first flight (from Lyon to London Luton). Moreover, I observed that other passengers had cabin bags larger than mine. Hence, today I observed that easyJet staff are not coherent in imposing additional fees to customers from one country to another. Also, they are not treating their customers in the same manner. I initially paid around £22 for this flight. In the end, it cost me £85: £22 (initial payment) + £15 (Large cabin bag ) + £48 (when they forced me to check in the large cabin bag that was supposed to come with me in the cabin) In addition to this, you can read on the news every day about the high rate of delays and cancellations of this airline. Don't underestimate the stress that can be caused by this airline. Also, it has plenty of other low costs around that do not have such bad reviews from customers. So, I would advise anyone to avoid this airline.",negative,-0.687802,1,28

We have in the past used Ryanair occasionally but once they started seating couples separately if they did not pay for seats we ceased to do so. EasyJet suits us perfectly and flies to the places we want to visit. We were apprehensive when the rules / charges relating to baggage taken on board were changed, but we experimented flying with backpacks only which will fit under the seats in front and found that we could easily manage with those for a week's holiday. Since then we have happily travelled lightly and found it very easy indeed. We actually registered the fact on our most recent trip that is the ""Speedy Boarding"" passengers who now rush to queue when the boarding staff appear because they want to make sure of finding locker space as close to their seats as possible. The rest of us who have not paid extra for anything can just wait and board at our leisure. I can't recall more than one major delay in all the years we have used easyJet and just a few minor ones. On our last trip earlier this month both the outward and inward flights left and arrived slightly early. Flying out from Liverpool as we invariably do, we find it very rare that there is any nitpicking about bag sizes (despite some of the bags that we sometimes see!) and the whole process of flying with easyJet for us is relatively relaxed. It obviously helps that we know the ropes and that we keep abreast of any rule changes e.g. regarding baggage.

Now Easyjet refuse to investigate it further until I get a letter from my bank saying they don’t have the money. So, either I’m a liar or my bank are apparently?

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Malaga,22-Jul,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Really bad and poor customer service and manage booking system. I had booked two EasyJet tickets for a flight this Christmas from Uk to Spain. I tried to add a selected seat today Nov 26th for one of the passengers, which included an extra large cabin bag and other different perks. Unfortunately, their system when you tried to get one of those selected seats, it does not allow you to continue with the process without buying obligatory another seat for the other passenger even I do not need it. So I decided to contact them by chat to see if they can get me a solution. After expending 30 minutes chatting with the customer service agent, he told me that he can provide me with this service but £5 more expensive than the website price. I asked him, why, and he mentioned that doing it through the website is cheaper. The situation was ridiculous, even though I spent precious time chatting with him, EasyJet wants to charge me more because of their badly designed system. I wished I could do it by the website without expending more time. So I recommend to people to even booked passenger tickets separately and you can manage the options individually or book flight tickets with another company which has a better system, EasyJet tries to get as much money as they can from their loyal customers. But never more, even I was one of the people affected by their famous data breach and never claim anything because I have been using Easy Jet for a long time and always I had good service.

I flew from Berlin to Amsterdam on November 18, flight EJU5107 seat 12A (exit row). Immediately I noticed that the flight was seriously delayed. During boarding, the easyJet ground staff is very unclear about who should board first. Nothing was announced either. As a result, it turned into chaos. After I boarded the plane, certain staff seem to speak very bad English. That shouldn't be too much of a problem, this becomes dangerous when there's an emergency and you need to communicate. I have flown with easyJet on a regular basis and all easyJet flights are always delayed (over an hour).

The travel day began with the initial flight and then Easy Jet reservations were made to fly hours later to Lisbon Portugal. We landed on time at CDG airport and received notification from Easy Jet that our flight to Lisbon was delayed for 90 minutes. No issue there for us - just a bit more time to stretch our legs. The communication from Easy Jet came in a text. I still have a picture of the text received. We arrived at the gate prior to the original departure time to find that the flight was only 11 minutes late and because we were not at the gate two hours prior to the original departure time we were not allowed to board the airplane. The gate agent would lend absolutely no support. We were not the only passengers that were left that day. We each purchased our ticket and a carry on bag for the flight. There were no other flights from CDG airport available to Lisbon that day which was not an option for us as we had to meet our tour group. We each had to make reservations for TAP Portugal out of Orly Airport - about an hour Uber Drive from CDG. This expenditure cost each of us nearly $400 - the Uber Drive, the last minute flight and the baggage. I reached out to Easy Jet upon our arrival home. The emails have been non-stop with sending our information, picture of the text message received and basic pleading to have our money refunded. We were only issued the tax on the flight which came to $19.06 Euro. We will never travel Easy Jet in the future. We will share our experience to whoever will listen and get the word out that this company takes no responsibility for their lack of customer service and their lack of communication.

After that, the boarding process took ages, as some people had their passes invalidated due to the mentioned overbooking issue, meaning their seats (mine included) were unavailable. What's funny about this is that even people in rows as low as 10-15 or so had their seats invalidated. Anyway the boarding process took well over an hour for the lucky ones, all the while the ground crew was being extremely rude to people that didn't yet fully understand the issue, instead of explaining what they were trying to do to solve the issue (we passengers do not care how your worthless service screwed up the bookings, do not belittle us for not understanding what stupid excuses you make). Now for the unlucky ones that had their seats invalidated, we were put to the side while they tried to figure out what to do, all the while the ground crew kept insisting for us to take the 500€ and go on another flight or whatever, which I find extremely distasteful, knowing that all of us should be compensated much better had we been refused entry. Some people that were put to the side still accepted the offer, which in the end did make room for everyone else on the flight, after of course another hour or so of waiting. Now with all that said, I wouldn't have minded the issue as much if it weren't for the rudeness of the ground crew, the almost 2 hours of keeping us in the dark about what was going to happen to us, and the persistence of the ground crew manager to have us go to another flight, if you really wanted that to happen offer something better than just 500€, you know very well the compensation the airline would have to give us had we been refused entry. To add insult to injury, when at last the flight took off, we weren't offered anything at all in flight, not one measly bottle of water or a bag of chips or a small cup of coffee, nothing, absolutely worst customer service ever. As a bonus, the cabin crew hit my leg with the food/beverage cart while I was sleeping, admittedly I had my leg on the corridor, which I hadn't done on purpose or willingly, but instead of waking me up to move my leg, they just hit it and all I got was a ""Oh sorry sir"", then the attendant moved on like nothing happened.

✅ Trip Verified ,A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Paris,22-Aug,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  I would like to report on a very unpleasant experience with a baggage inspector and in this context I would like to claim back the illegally collected fine of 29€. The whole thing happened on August 17th, 2022 at around 6:20 p.m. at Gate A38 of BER Airport, where I and my travel companion should have boarded flight EJU5539 to Paris Orly at 5:35 p.m. So the flight was already delayed. Shortly before passing the counter, a very unfriendly baggage inspector waved me out. He said my hand luggage was too big. It was a business case (see picture attached), which I have been using for years with EasyJet. On the baggage measurement system, it also fitted perfectly in terms of height and width. It only exceeded the thickness by a minimum of approx. 0.5 cm (which the baggage inspector had to indicate with a pen).  When I then took the suitcase to repack something for my travel companion, the employee yelled at me where I wanted to go. He threatened me it's too late, I have to pay or the luggage will stay here. After I still managed to take out a few things and the case continued to protrude slightly over the limit, I tried to explain to the employee that this is just air in the case and that the exact dimensions can be maintained by pressing lightly. The employee then slapped my hands and yelled ""hands off"" and threatened again that the suitcase had to stay here. Under this pressure, I paid in order not to miss the flight. I suspect that the employee deliberately wanted to play off his position of power. Unfortunately there is no way to counteract this. The customer service in particular treats the customers here like dirt. Either you get an email with an answer with copy & paste FAQ's or on Instagram it is claimed that unfortunately nothing can be done. (Where there is a will, there is a way? ) Hiermit möchte ich von einer sehr unangenehmen Erfahrung mit einem Gepäckkontrolleur berichten und in diesem Zusammenhang die widerrechtlich eingezogene Strafgebühr von 29€ (siehe Kontoauszug) zurückfordern.

Der Flug war also schon verspätet. Kurz vor passieren des Schalters winkte mich dann ein sehr unfreundlicher Gepäckkontrolleur heraus. Er meinte mein Handgepäckstück sei zu groß. Dabei handelte es sich um einen Business Koffer (siehe Bild im Anhang), mit dem ich schon seit Jahren problemlos mit EasyJet reiste.

Lediglich die Dicke überschritt er minimal um ca. 0,5 cm (was der Gepäckkontrolleur mit einem Kugelschreiber andeuten musste). Als ich dann den Koffer nahm, um etwas zu meiner Reisebegleitung umzupacken schrie mich der Mitarbeiter an wo ich hinwollte. Er drohte mir es ist zu spät, ich muss zahlen oder das Gepäck bliebe hier. Nachdem ich es dennoch schaffte ein paar Sachen herauszunehmen und der Koffer weiterhin minimal über die Begrenzung ragte, versuchte ich dem Mitarbeiter zu verdeutlichen, dass dies nur Luft im Koffer ist und durch leichtes andrücken exakt die Maße eingehalten werden. Daraufhin schlug der Mitarbeiter auf meine Hände und schrie ,,Hände weg"" und drohte erneut, dass der Koffer hierbleiben müsse. Unter diesem Druck zahlte ich, um den Flug nicht zu verpassen. Ich vermute, dass der Mitarbeiter bewusst seine Machtposition ausspielen wollte. Leider gibt es keine Möglichkeit dagegen vorzugehen.

Easyjet insist they have zero responsibility as we arrived 1.35 mins after time published for arrival so under the 2 hrs. They can get away with this by grossly exaggerating arrival time. I wondered why they were saying this short hop took so long, now I know. They are dishonest and bordering on corrupt. We had a horrific time at Gatwick, met with disdain by the most unprofessional person I've ever met. Told to rebook missed flight for 2 days later and pay transfer of £120. No assistance offered and absolutely no sympathy. Stayed in a hotel and flew with TUI the next day. They were wonderful in comparison. We all need to write to the transport secretary instead of Easyjet because they couldn't care less what customers are saying. They keep issuing lies about helping customers as much as they can but this is more corrupt nonsense. Why their staff put up with this chaos is beyond me, they should all follow their Italian colleagues and walk out. I hate to see jobs lost but I'd actually be happy to see Easyjet no longer exist.

We had extra-legroom seats in one of the over wing emergency exit rows but the standard seats looked fine for someone my height (1.74 m). Space is helped by the thin seats, I was concerned on first sitting down that these seemed rather firm but they must be well shaped because I stayed comfortable for the 3hr50 flight.

We were advised that our original flight was cancelled due to crew sickness. Apparently easyJet had no standby crew available in order to allow our flight to Bodrum depart. No empathy was shown by any easyJet ground staff at Bristol.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Lisbon to Paris,22-Mar,1,1,,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  First time I come across a budget airline that only includes a small backpack as a base. Even the small cabin suitcase allowance is an add on. So we were forced to upgrade to “upfront seats” (+25€ per person) to have a cabin suitcase. This option also includes a priority check in with the EasyJet Plus queue to skip the normal long single queue for check in (see screenshot of easyJet email). We arrived in the Lisbon airport terminal 2 more than 2 hours in advance though we knew that we could have priority check in at EasyJet plus. When we waited for a while and finally arrived at the counter 203, the woman there was very rude and told us they do not have priority boarding today and that she doesn’t know anything about it. We insisted with the proof from our email we can skip the long queue at the check in counters. She didn’t even bother to look at what was written in that easyJet email nor give any explanation to why this service was removed “today”. She said the priority boarding is only for people who require special assistance. She was like “oh your flight is to Paris, you’ve got plenty of time” in a nonchalant manner. And she just spoke directly to the clients in the long queue, “next one”, waving us away.  No apologies, no emails from easyJet communicating this before we arrive at the airport and nothing was written before people started queuing. We paid an extra 50 euros for this extra convenience but they did not honour their contract and completely ignored us at the EasyJet plus counter. We spoke to the service centre (Portway) for the airline at the airport but the woman there also refused to help. Said she can’t do anything about it. So we waited almost 1.5 hours in the normal queue. After we got our boarding passes, I met a lady in front of us had the same case as what we endured, but worse. She was refused on the EasyJet plus priority check in queue and then refused her boarding because she was “late”. So she missed her flight. Both of us arrived more than 2 hours before the flight time (the check in counter only opens 2 hours before the flight time). But I had to run to the gates in order not to miss my flight. We have taken many other low cost airlines like Transavia and Ryan Air, Jetstar, Tiger, Hong Kong Express but we never had any horrible experience like this.",negative,-0.740152,0,27

If this is not extortion I don't know what is. The plane was crowded, there was not enough space for baggage, the cabin was too warm, crew were Portuguese whom have become increasingly unfriendly, unnecessarily formal and even arrogant, easyJet have absorbed TAP's vicious habits in this route and what it seems their crew from 4 years ago. The resuming of flights by Ryanair on this route will put them back on their knees from where they shouldn't have left. Unfortunately they will very likely try to hijack the Regional Government with artificial arguments, which by incompetence, ignorance or dissimulation, they could concede to even more 'support', as if they needed. It is how this so called low cost airlines work. Commercial aviation needs urgent supervision by national Regulators.

Aweek before departure, we observed changes overnight in the restrictions introduced in Germany due to the prevailing pandemic. We have completed all the documents required by the German side so that our trip could take place. In addition, we checked the EasyJet app and EasyJet Hub every day to be sure that any additional changes would not affect our flight. The last change made to the Easyjet Hub took place on December 20. On the day of departure, the Easy jet staff responsible for boarding informed us that we would not be admitted to the flight to Berlin because we have Polish passports and we do not have a transit ticket (from Berlin Brandenburg airport to another airport). The situation was extremely stressful for us, because despite having all the necessary documents, we were refused a flight. We asked to contact the shift manager to confirm this decision, informing in advance that we had spent too much time trying to resolve the situation, which could result in the inability to change the flight (we could have changed the flight up to 2 hours before departure) we informed the staff that I am pregnant and this situation stressed me as well as my five-year-old son, yet we were told to wait for the manager's decision. After two hours, we have been informed that we would not be allowed to fly despite the documents we presented due to the fact that the staff interpreted the restrictions in their own way. We asked the staff for help in changing tickets to another flight, but we were refused help, suggesting that we could contact customer service ourselves on the number that we can find on the Internet.  I tried to call customer service to explain the situation. Unfortunately, each of our attempts to connect ended with a broken signal despite no problems with the network.

Hence I missed another flight at this point it became a comedy show due to the incompetence of EasyJet personnel, this was from the manager to a supervisor to customer service people who are clueless. Long story short me along with another couple who missed the flight because they were held in security needed to buy another ticket. This cost 110 pounds because they failed to inform us that if you don’t buy the ticket with more than two hours prior to the flight you have to pay their exorbitant fee of 110 versus 85.

After waiting another hour in the departure lounge, we were informed ‘Easyjet have been unable to find an alternative route or accommodation for the night. Please leave the airport by Gate number 5 and arrange your own accommodation’. After a frantic search online it did appear that all the hotels in Gibraltar were full. We were able to make contact with the host of the AirBNB that we had been staying at for the previous three nights and although his AirBNB was full, he made space for us in another property and charged us £160 for the emergency one nights stay. We took a taxi to his place and stayed the night. During the night we received an email from EasyJet informing us that our flight would take place at 18.00 the following day, 14th August. We therefore had to spend another whole day in Gibraltar. Obviously, we needed to eat and drink for our additional time there. At the end of this extra day, we took another taxi back to Gibraltar airport and thankfully our next flight left on time. A few days later we submitted an expenses claim to Easyjet for 2 x taxi transfers, 1 night’s accommodation and for meals and drinks during the day we were delayed. Easyjet have agreed to pay for one of our taxi journeys only! They have stated – the second taxi expense did not show a ‘route’ on the receipt so they will not pay. The food and drinks receipts we submitted were not itemised so they will not pay. The accommodation receipt did not have a date stamp on it (even though it was dated the 14th August the day after we should have gone home) so they will not pay. Easyjet flight cancellation actually cost us £289.00 and they have agreed to reimburse us £20!

There was the option to buy hold luggage which was more expensive as the cost started from around £20. Failure to comply will result in forcing a passenger to pay extra £24 for each cabin bag.

The main reason of my complaint now is this appalling, cheap and relentless baggage policy they have. Not being able to bring an overhead cabin luggage without paying extra for it is disgusting. It serves no purpose besides scamming your customers and making the check in less efficient, since a lot of unaware people have to pay 29 euros before boarding to get in the plane, and the suitcase goes to the hold and not even with you on board.

Thankfully though, their onboard sales are temporarily suspended and the aircraft looked neat and well cleaned. They definitely need more flights on this route, I paid 307 euros for both ways for flights that are domestic and no longer than one hour and a half.

Not even having on the phone my daughter and sending me an authorization with a wet signature they let me pass. Now I will have to drive back home with a baby her, leaving her away from her mother for even longer.  With all the bad things that happen in this world and you need to focus your time ans resources in avoiding a family to get together during this complicated times.

My wife made the booking, and when the flight was cancelled she was emailed saying she could take a voucher for the full value of the flight (no mention of refund), which she did. After a bit of Googling, we learned you had to call and request a refund over the phone, which I did, and the person I spoke to said they'd ""reversed"" the voucher and applied a refund instead but that it would take up to 3 months to appear back in our bank account. 4 months later and we still have no refund, so I called them back today and they're claiming they have no record of this conversation and that it's not possible for vouchers to be reversed to refunds.

In January we booked our flights to the UK with British Airways and we booked a flight from Glasgow to Belfast with easyJet. In June our British Airways flights got cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Covid-19 numbers in South Africa have steadily been rising and experts estimate, that the peak will only be reached in September. Since the cancellation of our British Airways flights, I have trying to get in contact with easyJet, to let them know, that there is no conceivable way we can get to Glasgow by the 21st August. All attempts to contact easyJet have been unsuccessful. After two hours of being on line with their customer care line listening to the stupid ring tone, I realised no one was on the other line. I tried their facebook, twitter and email accounts, but could get no response at all. Earlier this year, the easyJet website clearly stated that change fees will be waived due to the pandemic, as long as the changes occur 14 days prior to the scheduled flight. When trying to change the flights tonight (14 days prior to the scheduled flight), however I was charged 228 GBP for the change fee. Please keep in mind that the original flight cost was only 192 GBP. I find this unacceptable. You should be able to contact a customer care line and explain the situation, but I've only had generic responses from robots. Extremely frustrating.

In the new dates we closed the COVID-19 problem arose again, we tried again to contact the call center, but in vain no one ever answered us. The only information we have is that they will inform us one day before our flight, if it will happen, which makes it impossible to fully manage the rest of our travel bookings because the company does not know until the last minute whether it will take us to the destination us, without of course giving us the option of a refund or a coupon.",negative,-0.865966,0,25

After I checked in and boarding pass issued I booked and paid hire car payment made for gatwick parking low and behold I checked my flight status I discovered a disruption to my outward flight and after checking it then listed as cancelled. I had not received any contact or email by then. I try to contact customer services and after numerous attempts of an hour or more i got through after 2 1/2 hours, they confirmed that they cancelled flight. The reason was overbooked and anybody flying alone as I was had been was bounced off - my belief is that they are selling seats at much higher prices because of demand and that they could not care about those of us who who tried to support them and are frequent flyers with them.

The Customer Service rep who I finally managed to speak to (after nearly 2 hours of constant redialling) confirmed that Easyjet have received my parents refund claim but stated that they my parents claim will have to wait up to 90 days to receive their full refund. When I informed the customer service rep that they are acting unlawful stating this and my parents may have to ask their bank to charge back the refund from Easyjet, he said ""if your parents do that, they will then owe Easyjet the cost from the banks chargeback and will not be able to fly with Easyjet again""! With an attitude like that Easyjet do no deserve to come out the other side of this successfully and carry on being able to operate. I was flabbergasted. I only hope that customers of this wholly unprofessional outfit remember the way they are currently being treated (awaiting for their hard earned refunds for cancelled flights and services they are not receiving) and go elsewhere. As I stated to the customer service rep (before I left the call), with an attitude like this, Easyjet will be lucky to still be around this time next year!

I couldn’t stay in Bristol for that long, it was impossible; there were other flights to other two Portuguese cities the next morning, but they weren’t feasible either, since I had to invest more time and money. I had no idea what to do. I begged for alternatives, asking which was the nearest airport to Bristol and when would be their next flight to Lisbon. The senior manager suggested me to go to Gatwick, since the next flight to Lisbon would be the next day in the afternoon. London seemed reasonable, so I accepted. I couldn’t believe when I was told that all costs, from the taxi to the hotel, would be covered by easyJet. Not only did they book and paid a 2 hour and a half trip from Bristol to London, I stayed in a 4-star hotel in Chessington with dinner and breakfast covered.

Our flight was over 5 hours delayed due to an air traffic control strike which we were informed about whilst on the plane already 2 hours delayed. We were originally booked on British Airways and they cancelled the night before, which means EasyJet would have known about the strike at the same time and failed to act accordingly (notify us or tell us there would be a delay). We were kept outside in the cold waiting to board for 30 minutes before the plane was ready, then we were kept on the plane for 4 hours without any refreshments and not letting us disembark to stretch our legs. Then we were let off the plane into the gate to buy some food, which we had to pay for ourselves and not given any vouchers. Finally, we were let back onto the plane and took off almost 6 hours after the originally scheduled take-off time. They then provided us each with a soft drink and bag of crisps - hardly something sustainable for a delay of over 6 hours. The pilot told us that they should not have treated us like this and urged us all to file a complaint and ask for compensation due to the fact that the airline failed to inform us of the strike prior to boarding/delays. The crew told us that we could not get off and refuse to take the flight if we wanted to receive compensation so we felt stuck in this regard. I filed a EC261 Compensation Claim and was rejected within less than 24 hours due to the fact that it was an ""extraordinary circumstance"" due to the air traffic control strike. The circumstances were already known 24 hours before they told us. I fully expect to be compensated.",negative,-0.731312,0,25

Check In opened a little early as easyJet normally only opens two prior to departure. Going through security was very fast as they had 3 lanes open. Normally Belfast International airport is renowned for being very slow. I went to the Causeway Lounge and used my priority card for access. The lounge and service is good as there are sufficient selection of food, snacks and drinks available. They also call when boarding is starting and the lounge is located very close to the Amsterdam boarding gate. The boarding process on easyJet is by priority (speedy boarding), but you need to make sure that you are ready as it is difficult to get overhead space to put your hand baggage if you are not ahead of the queue. We pulled back on schedule and arrived in Amsterdam on schedule. You have you want something to eat or drink on easyJet you have to pay, however that is ok as the service is fast and efficient.

No delays, no canceled flights, professional and friendly crew - quite often with a good sense of humor. The prices are super competitive and they also part of an exchange now to make flying more friendly for the environment - already included in the ticket price. With Lufthansa, you have to go to an own platform and it’s complicated, takes extra time plus you pay on top without a tax benefit. easyJet is probably not the best place to work for the employees but it seems they have a good culture and the service is great.",positive,0.526984,0,25

Than we were sitting in the plane without getting any information as to why we are not moving. The plane departed at 23:58. easyJet demonstrated the disrespect to the passengers. They have known well in advance, that the flight would be delayed but did not dare to inform passengers. They could not care less.

On arrival at the gate I found there was a long queue into the ‘room’ where final boarding card and passport checks are carried out. Passengers were queueing out of the room and up two flight of stairs. There were signs for ‘speedy boarding’ but these were utterly pointless due to the overcrowding in the stairwell - the only staff on hand (who should have been marshalling this situation) were staff telling people that their hand luggage would have to go in the hold as the overhead lockers would be too full - fortunately this didn’t affect me as the staff started this process well behind me at the back of the queue, which then started moving. On arrival into the room and managed to fight my way through to the speedy boarding lane - I was naturally the last person in this queue. When we boarded the aircraft I then found that there was no space in the overhead lockers anywhere near my seat (1B), mostly because they were full of hats, coats, handbags, scarves and other items which, if the cabin staff had any sense and were in any way proactive about the situation, could have been put under the seat in front. At the insistence of the particularly unhelpful male cabin crew member, I had to place my hand luggage, for which I had paid extra, in the overhead lockers about 10 rows back on one side and the other item about 13 rows back on the other. I asked him if he would be retrieving them for me on departure to which he replied ‘no, I won’t be getting them’ - I already knew the answer and I knew equally well that this would mean that I would either have to fight my way upstream to retrieve them on landing, or wait for the entire aircraft to empty before going back to get them, which is the option I took which meant that I was the last passenger to leave the aircraft...from seat 1B - absolutely ridiculous.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to London,20-Jan,3,3,,,,1,1,no,1," I had a poor experience today flying from Zurich to London this morning at 9:30 local time. I have also flown a few times with a small backpack (to put under my feet) and a carry on luggage no problem with other airlines. The counter staff seemed unsympathetic at all and was pressuring me to just pay the CHF 76 and move along, standing in front of me just saying that it was impossible that all the stuff would fit (when I was trying to put the stuff from the small bag to the larger one.) She even went as far as to suggest to me and another family that we won't be allowed to test the luggage dimensions again and just to pay the 76 francs. (That's nearly as much as the ticket itself!) Even, when I did manage to fit the small suitcase into the slot, she said that it had to be smooth fit and that it couldn't be squeezed in. I have never expected such strictness and unreasonable behaviour from airport staff before and I can only believe it was out of spite that she said this as she realised that I had actually been able to fit the backpack into the carry on suitcase. I even saw her pressure the other family to pay just because they had an iPad that was not in the carry-on. When I got on, there was more than enough space in the overhead lockers and I had intended to put my backpack under my feet in any case to save space. In the end, I was forced by the same staff member to throw out my slippers as again she claimed they were an additional item of luggage. Seriously? All it did for easyJet, in the end, was that there was no way I would pay such a money-grabbing 76 francs and it didn't solve their issue of overcrowded luggage as the now larger suitcase was taking up more space in the overhead compartment than if I had 2 separate ones, 1 above and the small backpack underneath my feet. All in all, I believe this to be an extremely frustrating experience for both myself and easyJet as a company which could have been much better handled with more reasonable and less spiteful staff members who could have been more professional with the way they handled customers. Would not recommend this airline if you are looking for a decent customer experience.",negative,-0.69875,0,25
Not Verified ,A319,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Rome ,20-Jan,4,5,5,,,5,4,yes,10,"  London to Rome. Many of the poor reviews seem to relate to baggage issues. We followed the website protocol and booked 3 bags into the hold. We were well below the (combined) baggage allowance but preferred to play it safe rather than have hassle at the airport. Equally, none of us had wheelie suitcases but the kids and my husband had little rucksacks while I took a bag that fitted into the under-seat dimensions. As a result, we had no issues at the gate. On the return flight, they were asking everyone at the back of line, where we were, with wheeled luggage to check it into the hold but they looked at our bags and said 'that's fine'. I think that you just need to follow the rules with easyJet if you want a pleasant experience. Other than that, the flights themselves were great. Friendly pilots, very friendly cabin crew and an efficient service. We had onboard snacks and drinks and they were all very good. I don't think they were overly expensive but another time, we might take our own snacks to save a bit.

Indeed they were annoyed and angry with us because we blocked the aisle. A lady complained about that - she had seat row 1 - with the two assisting cabin crew but the two ladies ignored her. When we finally reached our seat, there was no longer space in the overhead for our suitcases. The two ladies assisting cabin crew ignored us again. When all passengers was seated and ready to go,  the captain announced a delay of 1 hour and 30 minutes and we had to wait inside the plane. The two cabin crew chatting all the time to each other and they ignored everything around them. They didn't do nothing about four-year-old girl screaming, crying during  the journey from Venice to London, included the 1 hour and half delay. When I left the plane I had a severe headache.

Whilst waiting for the coffees, an announcement then came over the speaker stating “Final Call for EasyJet flight to Belfast at Gate 3” My wife and I then had to abandon the coffees and run to the gate. This was very frustrating as we had paid for a service which we would then not receive. Secondly and most importantly, my wife is currently suffering from a severe hip injury which she is in the process of receiving treatment. Therefore having to run was a great deal of discomfort! When we arrived at the Gate, there was still a huge Que awaiting boarding onto the flight and it was very clear the “Final Call” announcement was incorrect. I  spoke to the EasyJet staff at the boarding desk and informed them of the  situation. I asked if it was possible for I to walk back to the Starbucks to retrieve the coffees but they said it was not feasible and I would miss the flight.

At Seville Airport it turned out that I was the only passenger whose luggage was lost. All my sports holiday plans were ruined on the first day. I was able to adjust them for the short-term but they managed to ruin it twice. At the airport (I arrived at ~11am), I was assured that necessary forms were filled in and I should receive all further communication by email. I’ve waited for some time - got nothing. Had to go online and manually fill in all the forms again; only after that I’ve got the first email saying “We’ll send you regular updates via SMS and email”. Since that email I have received no info by emaill/SMS in two days and had to call a few times a day to get some info, and every single time repeating all my details. Until 8pm I was not even sure if my luggage was located. Finally they’ve found it at Luton airport. No info by email/sms. Someone at the call center told me that the bag is scheduled for a flight on Day 3 and should be in Seville at 11am. Day 3: I’ve called easyjet early morning to figure out if the bag will be delivered today. Throughout the day, three people at easyjet provided me with certainty that the bag will be delivered today to my hotel in the afternoon, “certainly today”. I was a fool to trust them again one can judge. If they could only inform me that they cant guarantee a certain day of delivery - I would have come to the airport myself and collected my stuff, without which I was stuck in a Spanish village with almost nothing to do as all my holidays were dependent on my sports equipment. Easyjet turned out to be  liars as the luggage has not arrived that day. Also, only after my complaint about no communication - they did send another update, after more than 48 hours. Day 4 At 8am I reached the call renter again and a person there told me completely different info, that they have handed my bag over to the delivery center and can’t guarantee time of delivery. Why on Earth have not his colleagues told me the same info the day before?! All of them were assuring me to expect the bag in the hotel on Day 3. I was redirected to the local airport for more information. I’ve been trying to call them for 3 hours (was even wondering if this was a holiday in Spain?). Only at 11am someone picked up and told me that I should not call every day to them, and they already handed over my bag to the delivery company and no longer have info on that. I asked them to provide me with the phone number of the delivery company so I can track my bag and they were not able to provide it. I felt completely lost, miserable and helpless to be honest. At 2pm I received email which stated that the bag was delivered - it was NOT. I felt they were kidding me. Called them again - they have informed that the bag should be with me at 5pm. It actually arrived at 9pm. To sum up, that is the most awful customer experience I have ever faced.

Crew did its best to keep passengers informed but that mainly contained that they did not get any information from groundstaff. Finally after almost 40 minutes the captain left the flight deck and tried to communicate with the staff at the gate. It was frustrating for everyone and finally we departed more than one hour behind ETD. I have to say that I am commuting between AMS and VIE and usually take EZY. Out of VIE there is always a problem with the ground staff and the chance to be on time is little. The return flight was on time. Not much to say about service quality since there is none other than sales-service.

The food and drinks were ok, but quite expensive. Inbound flight EZY8088, they only had one sandwich option, and a tiny bottle of water to last three hours, was two and a half euros, (a one and a half litre of water from a mini market in Athens was only half a euro).

We were told nearing Bristol that the weather was poor and the pilots did attempt to land but there was a lot of turbulence so they chose to move onto Cardiff airport. The outcome was a short stop at Cardiff to refuel during which the weather improved at Bristol and we eventually landed at our destination about 3 hours late. All through, the flight and cabin crew (Antonio was cabin manager) kept us informed and were calm and encouraging - dealing with a poorly passenger and someone who was stressed, 22 passengers who chose to get off at Cardiff and a subsequent security check of the plane.

EasyJet and their airport services partners (OCS in Bristol and Welcome in Kraków) meant the trip went like a dream. I was assisted at every step throughout the airport process - from check-in, through security, up to the gate and finally on to the aircraft. On arrival in Kraków I was met by the Welcome team who not only helped me off the aircraft, into the terminal and through immigration, but escorted me to the railway station and put me on a train to the city centre. The whole process was replicated on the return journey. We often read criticism of easyJet and their ilk but I really think that people very often only write about their bad experiences.

After letting other women with totes and carry ons walk by she picked me out and asked me to open my carry on, put my tote in it, close it and fit it into the carry on size check boxes. My carry on is sold under description it  says allowed on EasyJet flights. When i did what she asked me to do my suitcase fit but i couldnt bend and lift the carry on again. When I asked for help she said she would come but made me wait until almost everyone had boarded. I asked her why she was being so mean to me while letting everyone else walk by with same or more luggage. No response. Instead of helping me she walked back to the line and boarded more passengers. At the end it was a kind young female passenger that helped me lift the carry on out of the size checking bars. She also commented on the employee's rudeness.  Because I was late in boarding despite having paid extra for a front row seat, my carry on ended up being stored 20 rows behind me. It will be fun finding it after landing. It is not that she asked me to check what is a standard rule at EasyJet but that she did not ask other with same or more weight to do the same so I was arbitrarily picked by her. I wish I had other choices when flying out of Bristol but Easyjet is my only option. I would really appreciate the company providing some common sense and empathy training to their customer-facing employees and ensuring that their rules are standard for all passengers, not just those an employee arbitrarily selects.

Priority boarding seems a little more exclusive as it should be.

After spending 5 hours with our cases he was discharged but told that he could not fly with his condition. As we had to get back to Liverpool we decided to go back to the Easyjet desk at Gatwick to see if they could advise us how we could get back home. After explaining our dilemma to a wonderful young lady, she who arranged a taxi for us to get home which involved a 500 mile round trip for the driver. She then supplied us with two tickets from Manchester to Palma the next day for two of us to continue our holiday. When I asked how much I would have to pay she said that Easyjet would foot the bill.

I was unable to find any locker space on the plane which meant I could put my bag under the seat in front, however, some may not be so lucky especially those boarding the plane last! Overall I was impressed flying with them. The plane was their new A321 Neo aircraft - nice clean plane with comfortable leather seating (no recline, however), lots of legroom for someone like me who is quite tall. There was good space under the seat in front, however, be aware that you might find the seat width a bit weird on this aircraft because they are more narrow than usual so be prepared to rub shoulders with other people! There are actually 2 sets of toilets at the back of the plane (I don't think there are any at the front). I was sitting as part of a group in row 36. Overall I had a pleasant experience.

I was very disappointed by one of the crew members of my Easyjet flight to Naples on 13th of October 2019 (flight n. EZY325). I’ve been told, rudely, that there was no more space for my small luggage and had to drop it. I gently explained that I needed the luggage with me because every minute was on the count as I was flying for a home emergency and couldn’t waste time at the airport once in Naples. She kept saying “there’s no space sir”. Then I raised, saying “My dad is dying, and I can’t wait for my luggage. Please just let me keep this with me.” She said “No, there’s no space. Just doing my job.” I’m not here to contest her arrogance, but there was not even a small track of empathy with my request. Like trying to understand the situation and at least try to find a little solution. Even because I’ve seen other people after me with some big bags or small luggage coming to the cabin. So I don’t understand the fact that was no space left. I found this very upsetting and disrespectful. This shows a completely poor attitude and a huge lack of moral and lack of professionality and lack of passion from the crew member. She might have had a tough day, maybe she was already on her second/third flight on her shift, but still: you get paid for it. It’s your job, not mine. And this is not an isolated case for Easyjet cabin crew, or in general low-cost companies. And I arrived at the conclusion that it’s sad to see tired members of staff not being focused on the customer needs but just on the Company business sides’ how to make more money “squeezing” us like limes. By the way, just for the records, even though the flight was itself late 40 minutes, I spent 20 minutes for my luggage and went home then couldn’t say goodbye to my father.",negative,-0.766267,0,24

We simply rearranged our luggage to comply, not being trusted that we would not reconfigure our now one suitcase and one backpack back to the original state with the same content, said jobsworth tried to check in the suitcase, with some protest she backed down. I would not mind but this was a completely arbitrary process that some suffered, others didn’t.

Also the person checking my suitcase didn't show any sort of emotions: I am used to customer oriented airlines where the staff cares about their customers, this is not the case for easyjet.

In fact, it was raining in the morning by afternoon it was slightly cloudy and other planes were departing on time from Barcelona. I was trying to contact the airlines by phone but it was not helpful at all. No response. Online chat button did not work and moreover, it is only available till 8 pm. During the waiting time, a representative of the air company offered the passengers a voucher for only 4 euros (a meal is much more expensive in the airport). Furthermore, the information about the vouchers was on their website an hour before they really started distributing them. The most important that I was not able to be on time at a railway station in Paris because I needed to go by train to another city in France. Being a student and having a limited budget I lost the money spent on my train ticket. The captain was very weird saying that our flight would last 1h and 35 minutes but then he said he would expect in Paris by midnight (considering the new departure time of 21:35).

We contacted easy jet to be told they had over booked our seats. The only option they gave us was to turn up at 4am of the morning of the flight and see if people didn’t show up, they may arrange another plane but that wasn’t a guarantee either. We felt our only realistic option was to book another flight for my husband and I as the likely hood of people not turning up for a flight in the school holidays was unlikely and likewise with easy jet putting on another plane. We spoke to easy jet about this and had to pay again! So we paid £275 each return originally and then the new flight out because they over booked and wouldn’t guarantee anything cost £150 each. To say I am disgusted with the airline is an understatement. To not exchange our outbound flight for free as they over booked our seats that we paid for months before is beyond as is leaving clients with very little alternatives than to either cancel the holiday or re book flights. Before now I can honestly say we have never had a problem with the airline, but to do this to customers shows how little they care. A very disappointed customer.",negative,-0.737076,0,24

We were in Milan for work (photographers at a wedding) and we arrived in time to learn only arrived at the airport that our plane had a delay of 3h. I never received a text message or an email warning me of the delay. Shouldn't I receive it? Apart from that, the flight finally started with 2 hours and 51 minutes of delay ... so not only the long wait but neither the compensation that starts from 3h. However we arrived at the airport in Cagliari at midnight. Deserted airport. We go to the car rental to pick up the car we previously booked but the car rental was closed. We looked for someone from easyJet to ask for help but at that time the airport was deserted. Having no other choice we took the taxi that took us to our accommodation where the next day we had another wedding (always work). The taxi cost us 120 euros. I sent the request for reimbursement of at least the taxi since no one will repay us for all the inconveniences attached to this delay ... but at least the out-of-pocket expenses. I respond that repayment is not possible. It seems absurd to me. The airline no. Does he reimburse the only means of transport available at that time at Cagliari airport? And what was I supposed to do sleeping at the airport? All this is absurd. The customer care is non-existent and assistance in case of problems also. I also purchased the insurance and supplement that does not give any guarantee. ",negative,-0.784482,0,24

We then had to leave one overhead-sized carry on to be stored below. That was what we wanted to begin with, but we had to drag it through a busy airport first. The big issue for us is that some people were charged for stowing that extra bag (€60) when others were not. This was after they were told to take those bags to the gate.

As a very regular flyer particularly with this airline I believe my opinions are fair and well grounded. Taking at least two flights a week every week, this airline has become very unreliable in 2019. Constant delays of evening flights being announced before 10am the same day. This Friday I faced yet another 3 hour delay, I hear all those saying claim, but this doesn't return the time lost and away from my family. What it does do though is add an expensive £50 taxi fare with other transport options closed at 2am. So, the moral of my story is, with a very delayed Friday the night prior I contacted easyJets plus and flight club that I have membership of hoping that I might be permitted to move my 9pm Sunday flight to an earlier option. I advised of the issues, very politely I add, the day before asking simply to take the plane 50mins earlier. Sure £100 plus was the reply, so this is from an airline that has over £5k of my money in flights booked through to march 2020, zero empathy, zero flexibility advising turn up early and take your chances like everyone else. So flight club and plus membership, let alone loyalty stands for absolutely nothing. Never once have I submitted an eu261 claim for the countless late arrivals and multiple taxi fares.

We have been satisfied with easyJet in the past but the return trip this time was delayed 2 hours and all we got was an insincere apology. They could at least have offered everyone a free drink. We also wonder why it is that the departure gate at Luton is always so far away from the terminal building. This time we had to walk to the farthest of 16 gates while only one of the other gates along the way was in use. The speedy boarding option offered by easyJet is worth the price as it avoids long queues. It is also possible to book seats with extra legroom, providing all passengers are over 16. Of course, the price adds up and if you pay for hold baggage as well it can cost as much as a regular (not cut-price) airline. For us, the convenience of flying from Luton makes this worthwhile.

The personnel there refused to re-open the drop off despite the fact that I had my boarding pass and hold luggage pre-paid as the process to re-open was “too complicated “ and was unable to provide any solution to me. As a consequence, I had to buy a last minute ticket with another airline (a regular one) at full price with no compensation. I am amazed by the total lack of service and could understand their behaviour if they would pay a full refund for any delay, even a 2 minutes one. Out of fairness, but the way they treat customers is obviously not 2 way. As a consequence I will never travel with them anymore and can only advise others to favour regular airlines which are very competitive price wise and offer some service.

It was a disaster. I’ve never flown with easyJet before so was apprehensive anyway but was worse than anticipated. We arrived for our flight, been through security checks, all the normal procedures and then proceeded to wait around for 4/5 hours for our flight - our flight was announced cancelled. We went to the information desk and asked what to do next and we’re pointed out of the waiting lounge to the EasyJet desk. We stood in a queue of about 200 people, all upset, and waited a good 30 minutes before being told how to rebook flights. There were only two members of EasyJet staff tending to the 200+ passengers with cancelled flights, one employee on the customer service desk and one handing out leaflets. We managed to get a free hotel for the night with a dinner and breakfast and rebooked a flight for the next day. Theyhotel was mediocre, the food was awful!  The next day we arrived for our flight, again 4/5 hours to spare. We got through security checks etc, and as soon as we got through to the waiting area our flight was delayed by an hour. It was then delayed further, and then delayed again and again. We waited for an extra couple hours and to our surprise we were given a gate to go to! We rushed to the gate, waited there for about 20 minutes, we were then told we had to wait for our flight to land and passengers to get off. We proceeded to wait. We watched the plane land, the passengers get off, bags being unloaded. Flights were taking off all around us. After watching all of this, everyone was getting agitated. Many people were surrounding the gate desk, asking what was happening. No one was getting a straight answer. Later we were told our flight was yet again cancelled for the second time. We then had to wait again for buses back to the baggage area. We made it back to the EasyJet desk with a queue of about 100+ people, all angry and upset. We waited for an additional 20 minutes before someone come out to speak to the passengers. One man at the front of the queue was very angry and started to raise his voice so the manager and employees walked away, back to the staff room I presume, and refused to speak to anyone because of one angry passenger raising his voice. We were left waiting in a queue with lots of agitated passengers so me and my partner left. If there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s to never use easyJet again.

I was left stranded in Zurich near midnight (not familiar at all with Zurich) and told to figure out how I would get to my destination on my own. Here is the text from them: We're sorry that your flight has diverted to Zurich airport. This is due to the closure of Basel airport. The disruption is beyond our control and is considered an extraordinary circumstance. We're very sorry but due to high demand in Zurich we are unable to arrange onward transport for you. If you’re able to make your own arrangements, we will refund the cost. Please retain all your receipts in order to make your claim. If you need any further assistance please speak to one of our ground crew in the airport who will be happy to help you. Note ""if you are able to make your own arrangements"" and ""one of our ground crew in the airport... will be happy to help you"" I found one of the ground crew and kindly asked them for help. They told me ""go catch a train"" (I remained very polite since I know it isn't their fault). I asked them where the train station was and if they could help me figure out which train .. they stated just walk straight and turn left you will see a train station (that is all they would say or do, I was left in shock) They offered no other assistance. I found the airport train station and because it was late at night no one was working there. I had to go to the automatic ticket machines. After struggling for 15 minutes I found out that to get to Basel I would have to take two trains and one bus, all of this in the middle of the night in a place I am unfamiliar with. Why couldn't they have at least given us a map and a guide to which trains we would need to take? This could have been very easy for them to print out and offer. When I arrived at Basel (after 2:00 am) I was informed that a KLM flight who was in the same predicament as my easyJet flight - diverted to Zurich., told their passengers to wait and when the storm moved past... flew them on to Basel. I would avoid this airline at all costs, they don't really care if you make it to your destination nor do they care about your  safety. I am still struggling to understand how they can drop you off in a different place and do nothing to help you get to your intended destination.

One of the cabin crew asked the senior crew member to stop the safety brief. He then shouted aggressively to half of the cabin (the area in which I was sat) and basically had a go at us all. He had a very angry look on his face and said we have enough time to talk later. A lot of passengers made comments to each other, including the two passengers sat next to me, at how we had been spoken to. Now I fully understand that the safety briefing is extremely important and from time to time the cabin crew have to be firm with passengers to get their attention, but there is a difference between being firm with customers and being angry/aggressive. After takeoff, most of the passengers sat quietly for the duration of the flight to Amsterdam as they felt like they had been “told off”. In future, I think some crew members need to think about the tone they are using towards customers and drop the attitude! At the end of the day it is them who set the tone for the flight for all customers and this flight was basically spoilt for most before we had even departed.",negative,-0.518501,0,24

This then allowed me to board at anytime during my leisure after Speedy Boarding, which I took advantage of as boarding looked a slow process. Aircraft was spotless inside and Edinburgh based crew were friendly and welcoming to everyone. Comfortable window seat, decent leg room as I’m 6”1, didn’t feel claustrophobic on this full A320. Much better than the A319 on the Glasgow-Schönefeld outbound on the Thursday where I felt squashed in the window seat. Even though the boarding looked slow at the terminal side, this was completed quickly and soon we were on our way. Service was quick to commence and a reasonable selection of products available onboard. I had prepaid for a bistro voucher so took advantage of the hot meal deal which todays hot selection was the Ham and Cheese Croissant. Hot all the way through, and sufficient for an early evening snack along with a chocolate bar and Earl Grey Tea. Also had a few G&T’s which was perfectly reasonable in terms of price, €14 Remember, these are served as double measures. About 3/4 of the way through the flight I went to pour my last gin when realised that during the trash run, I gave them the full bottle of gin rather than the empty one! So while heading to the back to the toilet, I had a laugh with the crew mentioning what I had done. To my surprise, one of the crew opened the recycling bag and had a quick check to see if the full bottle was amongst the trash. I did not expect that, and we had a laugh about it. No luck, which I assumed. During decent, the cabin manager was making her was from the back, stopped at my row and handed me over a g&t, they had found the full bottle, yet it was too dirty to hand back, so gave me a fresh one. That was well above what I expected! Landed 20mins ahead of schedule, as always lovely views coming into Edinburgh, but the time saved was ruined due to airport ground traffic and being bussed to immigration. Not easyJet’s fault.

Tried to put all of the items in carry on bag for all 4 passengers. In order to avoid paying £50 for each person, threw away two personal bags and stuffed all in checked in bags. Laptop, iPad, money bag and jacket was left in one personal bag. Representative insisted to stuff  all in 1 carry on because no personal items allowed. I showed her the board outside the boarding area, which says allowed personal items, she said, ""the board is not applicable to my ticket"". EasyJet was my connecting flight. We started with the same carryon on WestJet Airlines from Los Angeles to Calgary to Gatwick. Same carry-on with personal items was okay with WestJet but wasn’t okay with EasyJet. Representative said each airline has their policy. I charged £50 to my credit card and told her that easyjet will get 4 bad reviews today, she said, ""nothing she could do"". Now I’ll have to go to baggage claim for the one of the carry-on's that were checked in, which will delay my plans in Paris.

Baggage took 30 minutes to arrive at baggage area. Uber ride started at 6.10, overall 1.5 hours lost. I’m sure there is no penalty to EastJet for delays because we all sign fine print agreement upfront that says ""airlines are never wrong and they will pay nothing for customer inconvenience"". Airlines inside were okay, food offered at reasonable cost, water was available at cost. Of course no Entertainment. It was cold and no blankets or pillows were provided. Thank goodness I took out my jacket from the checked in bag. No announcement to apologize for delay in departure or arrival to Paris. I may have saved £50 when I booked my tickets but ended up paying that back to EasyJet, airline found an easy way to make money. Is there any governing body that could punish bad and intentionally fraudulent practices by airlines like EasyJet? I’m not sure if my review will make any change in EasyJet’s behavior towards their customers. Don’t they know flight will depart late, boarding will be late because it arrived late? If yes, why did they announce at 1.35 that the gate is closing and made us run? I’m sure many customers felt the stress and pain due to EasyJet’s unprofessional behavior and bad communications with customers. Considering my experience, I’m not going to fly again with EasyJet. There were other customers at the gate explaining similar issues, I’m sure they wouldn’t fly and give bad reviews. All my friends will stay away from EasyJet.

This group on Wed 12th June quite literally prowled up and down the line, totally ignoring the people themselves who they simply dismissed if they asked what was going on and why they weren't allowed to take the luggage allowance specified on their ticket onto the plane, just pointing at bags they could try and force the passengers to pay extra for and dragging them to the front of the queue to put their bags in the size checker then engaging in screaming matches with people who refused to be bullied and threatening not to let them on the flights if they didn't leave the line and go to the back! Easyjet have a mafia of these people who all clearly hate the job and the people flying with their airline and the whole experience makes Wizz Air seem premium. Pay slightly more and fly BA, or anybody else quite frankly!",negative,-0.803099,0,24
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Sofia,19-May,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,no,3,"  I had flown with Easy Jet seven years ago, and at the time, we got a low fare, but then there were many additional charges that were added. That was fine, as they were honest about it from the word go, and I knew what to expect. In booking with them for a flight to Sofia from Gatwick, I looked on line, and was pleased to see that they now included one cabin bag and personal item in the cost of their tickets, so I booked with them. I assumed that this was an attempt to compete with other discount airlines like Ryanair, etc. We checked in on line, and while waiting at the gate to board, there was an EasyJet employee going through the line and picking people out of the line and charging them a 50 pound fine for having an extra bag. She got a number of people as she did this and had a machine at the ready to charge our credit cards. When I protested, she said that our personal items were too big, and that I should have read the terms and conditions more carefully. How many people do that? Without being a member of their ""Easy travellers"" group, it was the same as always, and we were ""fined"" 100 pounds because our personal items were too large. Had we known, we would have factored that additional charge into the cost of our flight, and would have likely flown with someone else as the EasyJet flight was much more than other airlines with the additional baggage cost, and they flew at inconvenient times, and into the nasty, old disused terminal at Sofia Airport. If someone makes you pay an additional 100 pounds to board a flight you have already paid for, there is no name for it other than theft, fraud or extortion. At EasyJet, it is called business as usual. Never again!",negative,-0.427221,0,24

I went to the airport with some stress more than 2 hours prior to departure and after waiting a bit of waiting, I was told that the flight was overbooked, I got a boarding pass without a seat number and was asked to proceed to the gate. I would enter the flight if there was a no show from another passenger. I had hand luggage only and was pretty stressed. I was waiting on the gate and I informed the gate agents. They told me I'd have to wait until embarkation. Just 10' prior to departure I received an e-boarding pass on the app, with a confirmed seat (3B) and so I made it to the flight.

By the time someone from the airline came to us to let us know that the gate for our flight was at gate 27, it was too late and we missed our flight.  We got told to go to gate 6 to talk to someone from the airline. There isn't anybody gate 6, only a phone that nobody answers with a voicemail full. Eventually after about 10 calls or so we managed to talk to someone who said we would need to pay £99 per person to change the flight, either at 6-ish pm from Luton or 2.20pm from Gatwick. In the meantime someone from the airport came to ""escort us"" and take us to talk to someone from the airline. Once we passed security and were in the baggage claim area they actually disappeared. We  managed to find the Customer Service Desk to have someone tell us the same thing i.e. £99 pp to change the flight. Online the price was less so we booked online for the 2.20pm from Gatwick for £175.86 and had to pay another £62 (£31 each) to transfer to Gatwick for a grand total of £237.86.

Then they said, get your hotel and easyjet will refund. It was 1 am. A lot of people like me, we could not get a hotel at that moment, so we spent the night in the airport. Then, the personal of Easy jet promise us that we will receive a compensation for this problem, if we write a claim. I did, Easyjet said they can not give money for this situation. I can understand that sometimes Easyjet can have unpredictable situations, the problem here was the way the personal managed the situation. It was like they played with us and with our time.

There was then a further wait until we boarded. This was explained as due to a change of aircraft, which we had been advised of by email the day before! Once on board we had a further delay and finally departed about 90 mins late. flight time was less than scheduled and we landed at Santorini about one hour late. I am 6ft tall and found the leg room very tight particularly as my small cabin bag had to go under the seat in front. Seat itself was reasonably comfortable.

I have been bringing this backpack into the cabin for all my flights in Europe with budget airlines' A320 with no problem, and it always fit because (1) its a soft cover (2) I never fully packed it, so even though it exceeded the length and width requirement slightly, it was well below the height requirement. Other airline staff have always just taken a look and asked that I pack the contents a little tight so it can fit in the overhead bin, but not easyjet. Never mind that I explained that, this ground staff gave the excuse that the flight was leaving soon because of the delay and I had better pay the fee or I might miss the flight.

My 25 year old daughter has a severe fear of flying (despite having flown all over the world a few years ago) and I cannot thank the crew-and captain enough for what they did to allay her fears. They were exceptional in their treatment of her. They took her fears seriously and she even had the opportunity to speak to the captain on the homeward flight. They are responsible for helping my daughter go a long way to overcoming her anxieties which means so much to her. They also took her peanut allergy very seriously and announced over the tannoy that they would not be selling peanuts and asked that any passenger having a packet of peanuts not to open them. I flew to Jamaica with Delta Airlines in January and advised them that I am a nervous flyer (not phobic like my daughter) but at not one point did they do anything to alleviate my anxieties. People expect a lot when flying-and I get that-but the personal touch was incredible on these flights-including the ground crew. I just want to thank them for what they did and how their treatment of my daughter has helped her to overcome her fear of flying. As the captain said on both flights, turbulence is a matter of comfort and not safety. Such few words that she will remember for the rest of her life. Thanks, guys!",positive,0.401449,0,24
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lisbon to Luton,19-Apr,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Lisbon to Luton. My daughter and I spent around £550 on return flights to Lisbon including extra legroom seats. However, we weren’t aware that on the return journey this would mean we were part of the lazy crew’s party near the front of the plane. This activity all seemed to centre on friends they also had on the plane - and I know from a friend of my daughter that Easyjet staff can add anyone as family so we suspect high fares such as ours subsidise flights of any random person the crew might know. There was one guy in an EasyJet uniform who was a passenger but was sitting in the best seats in the house given lots of free food by his over attentive friend (before anyone else was served). Subsided again by paying passengers? Regular passengers such as we were overlooked (the guy at the end of our row was asked if he wanted anything but we weren’t). The crew later deny this but asking requires eye contact and a response. You’d think they’d want to sell their pricey refreshments but this crew were only eager to socialise with mates. They were banging against the barrier between us and them throughout the flight, carrying on so loudly we couldn’t hear through our headphones. People trying to get to the loo had to wait down the aisle. Complete joke. At the end of the flight the cabin manager made a jokey PA announcement thanking the crew for their hard work. He was laughing about it. You couldn’t make this stuff up. I laughed as well for different reasons - another crew member and the off-duty staff member sitting across our row immediately begin to challenge me so I told them the truth - no service and loud noise meant for a rotten flight. Well these guys didn’t like that and began denying everything. We held our ground and the off-duty guy became quite aggressive, almost shouting. On other airlines if a passenger did that they’d call the cops. The cabin manager told him to stop (in a far more polite way than he was speaking to us) and this off-duty guy loudly retorts that as he is a passenger he’ll do what he wants. I told him I wasn’t some weakling he could push around and at that point the pilot came out, ignored me and went to speak to my daughter- who was by now near the plane door and quite upset as she’s a nervous flyer and these lunatics weren’t helping. Pilot just said “Sorry for the inconvenience.” To quote the crew member when I told him I had video of their ‘party’ - “whatever”. Who trains these people? No one would be my guess. The off-duty guy laughed and carried on in the bus in front of us with his friends on the way back to the terminal - completely unaffected by his actions. The only crew working or showing their customers any respect was the female crew member. Never ever again.

Flight smooth and cabin crew very engaging. Flight departed a few minutes late but arrived right on time. No queue at Border Control so very quick completion of arrival formalities. While writing this, I have to say that I have travelled with easyJet many times and have never encountered any of the problems that other contributors allude to.

We booked our flight two and a half months ahead of time, and when I went to check-in for my flight, the website had said I had to visit the desk when I arrived at the airport. Thinking there was no issue, I arrived at the airport for EasyJet to tell me that I did not have a seat on the plane. Her exact words were, ""You paid for the flight, not for a seat."" Apparently, people who pay 24 euros extra to choose their seat have priority in getting a seat on the plane over those who do not. So, since they overbooked the flight, I did not have a seat on the plane I paid for (and neither did my friend), but our other friend did and had to travel to Paris alone. A worker escorted my friend and I to a counter where we got a new reservation for a flight that was 5 hours later than our original flight. We did get a 9 euro voucher and ""speedy boarding,"" but overall a flawed system and do not recommend booking with EasyJet unless you want to pay 24 euros extra to choose a seat or want to run the risk of spending 10 hours (total) in the airport. We also had to go through security again after visiting the counter where they rescheduled our flight. That was fun.",negative,-0.649465,0,24

The crew in the airport could not give reason as to why we weren’t allowed the same as the way there - their only reply was “well you were lucky on the way here then” in a very sly and sarcastic tone. They wanted to charge us €60 per case to go in the hold. I felt humiliated and embarrassed, having to pull out personal items such as underwear etc in front of over 100 individuals who were getting on to the flight. There was no privacy provided to try and rearrange the bags. After re-arranging the bags, and managing to get everything in to the one bag, the crew in the airport then called to say that cabin bags could be put in the hold for free  as the flight was busy and they would need any space possible. They do this after watching us struggle to put our items all in to one small cabin case. Why could they not have just let us wait till the end, and asked us to put our cases in the hold? This would not have been an issue in the slightest. Disappointed, humiliated and extremely unhappy with the service provided by the team in Schiphol Airport today.",negative,-0.435255,0,24

I have never flown with easyJet and it was my first time traveling to and within Europe. Our flight was cancelled the morning of our flight and after talking to the easyJet staff we were told no flights would be available for the next 2 days including the day that we were intended to fly. The strange part was that there were other easyJet flights flying out of the same airport the same afternoon just a few hours after our flight was cancelled due to a ""strike"". We had reservations and plans booked in Venice in advance for this trip so we needed to get to our destination. There is no travel insurance that will reimburse you for your cancelled flight unless the entire airport was shut down due to weather - that leaves it up the the airline. Travel insurance will also not reimburse you for costs incurred due to the cancelation and will not reimburse for reservations that were ruined as a result. There was no offered compensation or alternative option of travel offered by the airline. We were refunded the cost of our flight but that does not compare to that we needed to book tickets on an alternative airline which cost 9 fold. Pay 80$ now for a flight but pay 700$ at the door for an alternative flight. Thank you easyJet for this experience. Pay the extra money to book with a different airline and save yourself a headache. My mistake was not doing the research with this airline. I was told by others that last minute flight cancelation happens frequently with easyJet.

We do understand that these things happen, but the service was very poor throughout this. On our return in Amsterdam, the lady at the check in desk was probably one of the rudest people I have ever spoken to and it seemed like she went out of her way to make our journey harder. We were seeking advise for our case allowance as we had to buy more clothes due to us not receiving our luggage, and we were told completely different things by two EasyJet colleagues. One told us that we could pay for the hand luggage and combine the weight (costing 7€) but the lady on the desk told us we would have to pay 45€. We questioned this and they allowed us to put through the 7€ option once it was confirmed that we could do this.

✅ Trip Verified ,Airbu,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Gatwick,19-Mar,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Flights to and from Amsterdam from Gatwick booked weeks ahead and both journeys checked in before we left the UK. Not the cheapest flights available but economy. We arrive at the airport 2 hours before flying, in plenty of time, clear security easily and go to the gate area to wait for a specific gate. 10 mins before the scheduled departure another passenger notices that the departure time has changed from 19.45 (imminently) to 17.50, no other information. This causes other passengers to check their app to discover, then relate to us, that the flight has been cancelled. Not delayed, just cancelled, and that the 17.50 departure is the next day, Saturday. Savvy frequent flyers rushed off, knowing what to do, some even got alternative flights with other airlines. We were left standing with no information and no instructions what to do. There were no EasyJet staff on hand to explain, to offer suggestions or just tell us where to go. Eventually we found an information desk and they directed us back out to the Departures hall (back through the Baggage Hall and Passport Control) to the EasyJet check in guest where the other 150 or more passengers were waiting to find out what they were going to do. I waited in the queue for about 90 minutes to get to the front to be handed a piece of paper with the name of a hotel on it and the next day's flight details. It took them 30 seconds to give it to me. When I asked why they didn't just hand that out to the whole queue the poor desk staff, (who were not EasyJet staff just local airport representatives), said sorry the 40 rooms they had at the airport were full so we had to go back into town. So a train back in Amsterdam, a taxi to the hotel (which was very nice) but no meal as promised by EasyJet and by then the kitchens were closed. The next day our replacement flight is the last one out of Amsterdam, not the first or anything else during the day. The amazing thing is that there are no EasyJet people to talk to. None of the staff are theirs, not the check in or the gate staff. They know EasyJet are rubbish so they are practised at apologising. Don't fall for the cheap price, it's not worth it. The delays are inevitable, the cancellations random and the service non-existent. Pay a little bit more to know that when it does go wrong, as it will, there is someone there that can help you. The next day I had downloaded the app in order to check in on line. Using the flight tracker I could see the incoming flight from Alicante. Maybe the day before it came from somewhere else but the method is; plane comes in, offloads passengers then gets sent on somewhere else. The Friday flight was cancelled due to 'a staff welfare issue'.  Whatever, it must have been known about on the other flight, for some time, to allow then to make alternative arrangements for a spare pilot, 2nd officer, navigator?, cabin crew. But no, EasyJet don't do that because they care more about the bottom line than customer service. About 180 passengers on an A320 Airbus. Each passenger entitled to a minimum of 250 euro compensation plus hotel rooms, transfers, food etc, could cost them 63,000 as a conservative estimate for 1 cancelled flight. A lot more than the cost of one or two spare crew on standby. I learn today that Amsterdam is an EasyJet hub airport. But it doesn't matter to them, the only thing that matters is bums on seats.

Paying the small extra fee for speedy boarding meant we were able to take our carry on bags on board as the flight was full. Cabin crew operated a full trolley service just after we took off and an extra drinks service before landing. There were regular updates from the cockpit during the flight and a warning that it was going to be a 'tad' bumpy just after take off and we need not worry as the aircraft was going hit cold air has it climbed to its cruising height. Due to a tail wind we arrived in Pisa 90 minutes ahead of scheduled. The return flight into Gatwick was of a high standard and the cabin crew seemed very professional and exceeded customer expectations. Again the cabin service was slick and polished. Easy jet have now followed other airlines and allow you to pre order a meal (Hot or Cold) prior to booking and you are served prior to the main service, this is a good idea and worth every penny of the cost.",positive,0.727857,0,24

I was coming back from Bangkok, after a 12 hours flight, after a 2 weeks holiday in Southeast Asia. Landed in Milano Malpensa, still 6 hours to my flight to Berlin, when I realize I was not able to do the online check in from my app, for me and my girlfriend. We tried 2 smartphones, and iPhone and a Samsung S8. No one worked. We reached the EasyJet desk as anxious about the issue. The employee at the desk advised us that the flight was ""overbooked"", and we were the first 2 passengers in overbooking. We booked and paid the tickets in November, and few hours before I got this brilliant news, and after that, the person at the desk said: I wish you luck. You might be able to board this flight. I used to work for an airline and I know how the system works with EasyJet, so I know that every flight has a no show percentage, but I do not expect to need to have luck to board a flight with a normal ticket, purchased more than 4 months ago. I had two options ahead of me: 1 wait till the end of the boarding even if I had a ticket already - 2 in case there was no seats available, getting a hotel room and wait time to be refunded, and leave the morning next. Both solutions were for me ridicolous as we are talking about tickets that I purchased more than 4 months before, considering the fact that I needed those tickets to get back home in Berlin. As I expected there were around 15-20 empty seats on board, but still I had to wait till the end of the boarding, so in the end I board the flight but still, this is unacceptable.",negative,-0.439713,0,24

Having read the reviews about EasyJet in recent times and not having flown with them for many years I was a little apprehensive of the service and flight I was about to receive, however I can’t speak more highly of this airline. In the three flights I took over the last few days I witnes some of the best cabin crew, and excellent examples of great customer service. My last flight I was asked politely if I could move seats as I customer had booked to fly with a large musical instrument, the crew found me a seat at the front of the aircraft. I’ve had a similar experience on BA and I have to say they were rude and told me I had to move and put me in a seat at the back of the plane! I’ve flown with many airlines around the world and even the best get it wrong sometimes, but I just felt that I was in safe hands with easyJet, they have a professional attitude and seem to be a willing to accommodate in a low cost world. They are a low cost airline and I’m sure passengers should remember that when they have 5* demands however that should never excuse poor customer service and unprofessional behaviour, on the flights I’ve received this year so far I’m happy report this was far from the case onboard easyJet. I for one will highly recommend them.",positive,0.374648,0,24

Delayed flight EZY6346 from Funchal - Bristol Passengers asked to go to the gate at 11.20am very few seats available. Speedy Boarding section indicated for SB passengers to line up. Kept waiting, standing, until 12.05pm when Speedy Boarding passengers asked to load into bus. The bus then loads all the other passengers meaning SB passengers are now the last passengers to get off the bus and hence the last on that first bus to load onto the aircraft. We choose SB so we do not have to wait so long to board. This time not only did the bus not let passengers off immediately but we then queued behind all the other passengers to get aboard the aircraft, get to our seats and then find space for our hand luggage. Easyjets response was as expected, we don't refund. I was told SB was ""A Benefit"" funny that I thought when we paid a lot of money for a decent seat we were also paying for Speedy Boarding. The plane left 1 hour late, The plane was dirty, crumbs on the seats and paper on the toilet floor. The snacks expensive and the Chicken Chilli wrap freezing cold with the wrap soggy when it thawed out.

We could have boarded the plane as we only had hand luggage but, even though there was still half an hour before the flight was due to depart, they wouldn't allow it. They want to force you to buy another ticket for another flight (there were none). Net result is that we didn't fly! I have never used this airline before and will never try again.

Easyjet accepted cash, which really convenient (receipt given) and the food is excellent value. The only suggestion I have is that on the way back to Luton the plane needed a more thorough clean and the tap in the toilet had a small drip that needed fixing right away.

The agent refused to have me check in without such a proof. She argued that this regulation had been put in place years ago and started yelling as I was insisting. I traveled to Israel more than 30 times and never heard about such a regulation. I asked to be shown this regulation in a written form. No one could at Paris airport. Still, I was forced to book a flight online as I was about to miss my plane.I ended up booking a bad ticket money- and travel-wise as I was so much rushing to be able to board my flight. After arriving at Ben Gurion, I asked around about this regulation.No member of the Israeli staff had heard about it. I sent a request for clarification at easyJet customer service. The request was sent on Jan.30th. I was told that a proper answer would come within 27 days. It came almost two months later with the following content: ""Regulations vary depending on which country you fly to and from therefore I will not be able to provide you with the suitable information regarding travel documents, I can advise that you call your local Embassy or Consulate in this regard"". What sense of responsibility does this company have when it comes to the policies that it decides to put in place out of its own initiative?

Our flight to Venice was okay. Half an hour delay due to the whether, but whisked to Venice with a strong tail wind. Friendly staff, bad legroom but it's low-cost. The way back was a different story. Our flight was cancelled in the last minute because of bad wheater in Amsterdam. It was bad, but why didn't KLM cancel its flight on the same route? Apart from that easyJet managed the situation very well. Off course there was a queue, but within 30 mins I got a message that we had a reservation in a 4 sta rhotel for the night, including transport, diner and breakfast. Since all easyJet flights were full, we chose to fly to Düsseldorf the next day on Eurowings. I asked for a refund and the next morning it was credited to my card. So the downside is that easyJet doesn't transfer you to a different airline, but they managed this situation extremely professional.

This fee also included ""speedy boarding"" which made is less likely that I would be separated from my cabin bag upon boarding. The extra cost was well worth it. I was able to enjoy what is good about Easyjet whilst not being sardined into one of the seats at the rear of the aircraft. Easyjets model is a good one, no frills for those who don't need/want them and some frills for people like me that value a little upgrade in comfort.

Exactly one and half hours before the boarding time, i was told i won't be able to fly because the flight is overbooked. Then, as i asked for compensation to pay for the overnight stay, they said that the compensation is not given immediately but in some weeks. I can understand that the flight was overbooked. But, what i fail to understand is the airlines responsibility. How can they randomly pick up few passengers, block their rights to check-in, and don't even bother to pay compensation immediately. Everything about Easyjet was like a nightmare. Uneducated and extremely arrogant easyjet Copenhagen airport staff.

What professional airline do not have the simple means of communication! Staff were very unhelpful and placed the claim immediately on us the passangers. We were not alone with four other passangers in the same predicament. No effort was made at an apology and staff seemed very indifferent.

The transfer from airport to hotel was perfect and the hotel itself was amazing. The nightmare started when we boarded the return flight from Agadir (EZY1906) at 8:20pm. The pressure of serving customers food must have got to the manager of the onboard team. Customers were being ignored when they asked for assistance, one passenger asked for sugar and the staff member responded “I’ve only got two hands”. One customer asked for tissue three times. I witnessed another incident where a large female woman walked past and both staff members grinned at each other whilst looking at her in disgrace. The members of staff were blind to the fact that they were doing this infront of passengers. One passenger looked at me and said this is what you expect from a budget airline. I disagreed. No passenger should be treated like this. I have travelled may countries around the World, but must say that this particular EasyJet flight was the worst. A great holiday ruined on return. I personally think EasyJet could become a great airline if the right staff training is provided. As mentioned above, the staff on departure were excellent.
