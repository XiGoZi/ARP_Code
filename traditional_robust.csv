? Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Paris to Toronto,24-Jul,2,1,1,1,,4,3,no,5,"  Disappointing Premium Economy onboard experience on flight segment from CDG to YYZ in July 2024 with AirFrance. Journey segment originated in AMS, and the SkyPriority AMS airport was quick to check-in and drop-off luggage, with express security line, but wasn't really needed since the regularly security lines were moving just as quick. The AF Premium Economy experience on the trans-Atlantic segment was a real disappointment though, and should next time choose one of their SkyTeam members like KLM or Delta instead. Seats and cabin interior were dirty. Crumbs, dirt, and hairs evident on the seat, storage areas, food surfaces, and floor. Headphones are built-in cord-connected to the plane, with a sticker claiming they have been sanitized after each use, which I'm not so sure off. Service on the plane is really disappointing, with crew really not friendly at any point during the flight. They look angry, don't smile, and try to avoid any service as possible. Was almost impossible to get a drink at any time during the flight, as they don't answer the attendant call requests either. If you can the attention of a steward to request a drink, they are served in such small paper cups, and then filled only half full, so it's basically the portion of a Costco drink sample. In flight hot meal was a disgusting mushy pasta with mushed peas puree and it didn't look any better. Best part was the dinner roll with butter. Late night snack was a cold soggy bun with a super thin layer of pre-spread hummus, which was also quite gross. If this was the service and food in Premium Economy, I can't imagine what Economy was like. Online reviews said Air France Premium Economy was good and I was looking forward to it, but now I wouldn't recommend it. Would opt for a different airline.",negative,-0.679261,0,91,9.826499,6.990257

I had a terrible experience due to them overbooking my paid for flight. Being an international flight, they rebooked me a full 24 hours later causing me to miss a whole part of my trip and booked itinerary. They were rude and unhelpful when I reached out to them to ask for compensation due to missed tours and hotel stay that I could not be reimbursed for. They wouldn't admit to any wrongdoing and blamed it on my connecting flight that was delayed, even though I still arrived to the gate with plenty of time to board and had checked in online. They did not provide any compensation and would not admit to their overbooking being the cause of me not getting to Paris as I had booked. The letters and follow up I received were rude with no empathy for what was a nightmare travel experience. I have flown internationally and booked many trips, never have I experienced such an awful situation as this. It was a first time trip to Paris for me and I never want to go again, especially with this airline. For whatever it is worth, I hope this helps someone else if on the fence with booking - I don't like to complain but somehow I needed to do what I could to hold this airline accountable for my experience.

Recently, during a multi-stop trip, we experienced 3 separate terrible experiences, leaving us unwilling to fly Air France again. First, from LAX to CDG, our flight was expected to be delayed which would result in our missed connection out of CDG. We were informed the morning of, and we were automatically, without our input/consent, changed to another flight later in the day. It took a 2 hour long phone call to convince the Air France representative that our preference was to remain on our original flight (despite the missed connection), and that they should not have assumed our preference was to take the later flight (which would not have made it to CDG in time for our connection anyway). The Air France representative insisted that I was the one who had requested the change during an earlier phone call, which was a blatant lie. Next, from BCN to CDG, our flight was canceled due to smoke detected in the rear of the plane. While we truly appreciate the safety precaution, this led us to be delayed, potentially missing our connection flight home from CDG. We were shuttled out of the plane, and taken back to the terminal where we were greeted and instructed by absolutely no one, displaying a shocking lack of empathy and support. We were all on our own, left to figure out how we would retrieve our bags, rebook flights, where to go, etc. Air France customer service dropped the ball here yet again. Finally, on our rebooked flight from BCN to CDG, our flight was 2 hours delayed due to an employee strike. The Air France employee speaking on the intercom was very clear to let us know that it was not Air France's fault, but rather the fault of a contractor. While this may be true, I still hold Air France accountable, and they could have handled the situation better by communication updates more frequently, and being better prepared by foreseeing the strike or having a contingency plan to minimize delays. Ultimately, we missed our connection flight out of CDG and had to stay in a mediocre hotel by the airport until our flight the next day.",negative,-0.752723,0,91,9.826499,6.990257

Air France will not help and does not care. They changed my gate information after issuing me the boarding pass. The new gate was 5 miles away from the original. Not just a few gates. Because they refused to give me my boarding pass once I was in their wheelchair assist program, I could not move on my own. On top of that, their staff kept us away from any monitors that would have shown the gate had changed. At NO POINT did they ever email, text or call us to let us know the new gate. Because their wheelchair assist was so slow, we showed up at the wrong gate with only 15 minutes left only to see an empty gate. They refused to hold the flight, even though it left 30 minutes late. So they weren't pressed for time, they just don't give a darn Out of the 12+ employees we dealt with, ONE helped. The rest were useless and lazy. They do not care about people at all. We were able to get a flight on Delta and make it home. One piece of luggage was delayed, but again, the luggage was being held by Air France and they don't care. Once it fell into the hands of Delta, it moved very quickly. On the flight getting to Europe, they gave us 4 ounces of water and that was all for a 10 hour flight. Then lost one piece of our luggage and lied to us about it. I have heard that the French are rude to Americans, but I assumed it was more urban myth; NOPE.

This review is for the Air France flight from Mexico City to Paris (CDG). First, the lounge experience that Air France leverages in Mexico City is subpar. The hard product (A350-900) is a very nice aircraft. No complaints with the seat, although the space for legs/feet for sleeping is a bit tight. Boarding was hectic in Mexico City. The flight attendants were friendly but nothing beyond the basics. The food was poor. The steak dish was horrible and bland (and cool). What really made this flight the worst, was the fact that Air France did not load any passenger bags (or pets) on this flight and did not tell the passengers until after arrival in Paris (at an empty baggage claim belt), and everyone had to enter a claim. Even though they knew this for the entire eleven hour flight. Apparently overloaded with cargo. Air France does not have bag tracking like United (for example) and the claim system was not updated promptly, so no indication of if/when bag would be delivered until a few hours before arrival at hotel the following evening (and I was leaving for another city in the morning!). Submitting claims for items purchased in slow and they don't except bank credit card receipt info (even though this shows date/location/store/item type, etc.). Had to be persistent with my responses and still not be compensated for the entire amount. Ability to contact Air France Customer Service is not easy to do.

The night before our flight, we got an email that we've been rebooked Chicago - Detroit - Paris, with the first leg being on Delta, the second leg being Air France in Detroit. We were annoyed because we paid for a nonstop ticket, but figured, at least we will still get in Paris, just a few hours after our original itinerary. Well, Delta to Detroit was delayed, and even with 20 of us that got rebooked on that Delta flight in Chicago trying to make the Paris connection, Air France did not wait for us in Detroit. We landed 36 minutes after the scheduled Paris departure. Now, we were stuck for a whole day in Detroit. We had horrible room accommodations, a shuttle that never showed up, and a day wasted on our short itinerary. To make matters worse, there was no one at Detroit airport from Air France (AF) to talk to all day so we tried working through an agent with Delta, but they could not see AF's international flights to help. Since we were now arriving in Paris a whole day later, we had a hotel night we had to pay for, museum tickets purchased in advance we could not use, and dinner reservations with a strict cancellation policy that charged us for not showing, despite our emails and pleas to not charge. Regardless, AF initial decision to bump 20 of us off the original nonstop flight in Chicago to Paris, caused us all to miss a whole day in Paris and cost us hundreds of dollars. I made a claim on Air France's website, which they replied to and said because the delay was less than 3 hours, no compensation would be rewarded. What are they even talking about? They clearly did not read our claim, so I called customer service, to which they could only reopen the claim but we cannot talk to anyone on the phone who handles the claims. I pleaded with them on two separate phone calls over two days to please let me talk to someone in claims or customer service or anyone who can help, to which they were very strict in saying there is no one for me to call, I just need to wait another week to hear back by email. Sure, the email's that they don't read and just send random responses to... all I can think of now is to get their attention by 1 star reviews.  What a horrible airline, with horrible policies.

Ticket purchased and confirmed. The next day, I received an email saying that they have switched aircraft and that my business class ticket would no longer be honored. I applied for a refund on Air France's non-user-friendly site, only to be told eight times that I didn't qualify, but twice that I did, only to later receive another notice saying I had filled the form out incorrectly. They just send back a decline and no further instructions. This has been going on since January. I've spent hours navigating their system. Long ago had to pay the credit card bill. This run around seems intentional. (I've even had French friends get involved and each time they hit a wall - not because I'm not entitled to a refund, which I clearly am, but because the online system either disconnects or ends up requesting information that I couldn't possibly have.)

On the positive side was the seat, perfectly private with sliding doors, great screen (selection of movies was ok but not overwhelming), of course the food and lovely wines were offered (but not proactively refilled). What really left me puzzled was how incredibly dirty the toilets were, already one hour into the flight. It was obvious no one really checked those toilets at any time. Furthermore the slowness in which the meal was served was disappointing. I am absolutely a fan of no rushed meals when a flight is 10+ hours and I love to take my time, but on this flight it took a full hour before we were served an aperitif and another hour for the meal to be served. At the end of the meal, we were already 3.5 hours into our flight with another seven to go and two hours before landing breakfast was served. Of course one may skip the breakfast and sleep a little longer, but it is hard if all cabin lights are being put on and there is action in the aisles.

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Los Angeles via Paris,24-Feb,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," As an Airline Pilot myself, I understand the frustration that comes with passengers bringing a large quantity of baggage. I also understand the reason airlines prefer less bags and charge for additional weight/pieces. As I booked my parents standby to and from India, we didn't know in advance what airline they would be returning with (along with baggage restrictions) based on loads, until shortly before their return. The issue in this circumstance is that they were charged a total of $980 Canadian for 2 legs which we believe is an unreasonable amount. It appears that Air France has decided to just charge whatever they want to maximize profit with little regard for customer service and a positive experience for guests, especially ones travelling interline. Here is the experience from my parents point of view: Our trip with Air France started in Delhi, India where we were booked to fly to Paris and then to Vancouver on 29th Feb, 2024 Although the Staff at Indian Airport was very friendly, they did charge for extra suitcases for me and my wife, from Delhi to Vancouver at $120 CAD each. We each had a cabin briefcase and a personal item with us which was allowed without any issue. Interestingly my itinerary mentioned the flight departure at 1:45 AM as well as the online check-in, but the boarding pass indicated the time as 5:15 AM. I confirmed the flight time by calling Air France office in Delhi and confirmed the time as 5:15 AM which means that my connecting flight from Paris to Vancouver was no longer an option for me. The Paris-Vancouver flight was already departing by the time we reached Paris. Our son booked us to Vancouver via Los Angeles through Air France and then through WestJet from Los Angeles to Vancouver. The customer service at Paris Airport was the worst we have ever seen. No one was really ready to talk to you if you didn't speak French. While booking our luggage again at Paris to Los Angeles, we were asked to pay for 2nd suitcase again. We showed them the paper that we have already paid for the extra suitcase at Delhi Airport so they let us go. While going through the line for security check we were directed to another place and asked to weigh cabin case and personal bag together and were told that the weight is more than 12kg so we have to go back and book the cabin cases. We tried to explain that we are interline standby travelers and we are already connecting through an Air France flight where it was not an issue, but the person there was not ready to listen to us nor was he talking to us in English. He just kept pushing us to go and book our cabin bags. We had to go back and book our cabin briefcases and they charged us an excessive amount for that (240 Euro for each of the 2 cabin briefcases) We wanted to talk to someone and raise our concerns but no one was ready to talk to us or listen to us , probably because we were English speaking. As someone in the industry, I believe it would be hard to justify this amount. I look forward to your response and a chance for Air France to show they do value fairness and most importantly, customer service. After filing a complaint on their website, AF has been having us jump through hoops, utilizing delay tactics and refusal to allow communication with a supervisor.

The rest felt very economical; the supper was not worth the sleep time spent on it. The breakfast was much worse - I chose scrambled eggs and vegetables (in a hope that this would be basic enough for not being screwed up), and I was wrong. It was the worst breakfast I had in years. It tasted like the cheapest deep frozen breakfast from a discounted grocery. Aside the meals the other aspects of the soft product were passable, although very economical in any respect ¨C the cushion was very small, the duvet was thin, the necessity bag very poorly stocked (as well as the WC), the snack buffet was very poor.

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Belgrade via Paris CDG,24-Mar,2,4,,,,1,1,no,2," I misconnected in CDG on a through ticket, purchased directly from Air France, on their website. The flight from Heathrow to Paris left on time and landed on time, but there was no one to operate the jetty at the gate which resulted in waiting another 40 mins on the aircraft. The Captain has not released the seatbelt sign, asked everyone to remain seated. Passengers with connections were getting anxious when we were sat on the aircraft for nearly as long as the duration of the flight. Once we were off, I started my long airside journey to the connecting flight. I ran through the terminal, waited for the connections bus, got on the bus, ran again, joined the queue for immigration, cleared immigration, then went directly to the front of the extremely long airside security queue and very politely asked if I can be fast tracked due to short connection, the security guard has agreed and allowed me through. I ran again and got to the gate, the aircraft was on stand but flight closed. There were another 17 PAX on this flight who missed the exact same connection behind me, they all arrived 30 mins after I got to the gate (they probably waited in security queue). Anyway, Air France refused meal vouchers, accommodation and any sort of rebooking assistance stating it was my fault I had missed the connection. The lady at the desk was unnecessarily rude and even said I had to buy a new ticket out of pocket at the cost of thousands of pounds, and my return journey would also be lost due to me being a noshow. Which didn`t make sense because I purchased a through ticket and a seat at the front, for the security of assistance in the event of disruption. Luckily, I know any decent airline will rebook you if you misconnect on a through ticket under such conditions. I went and purchased hotel for two nights, then went back to the airport and only after I had thrown a tantrum, together with the other 17 passengers who were still there two hours later arguing with staff, have they agreed to rebook us on the next flight, two days later in the evening. This was a horrible experience, unnecessarily stressful and a waste of everyone`s time. I have never dealt with such incompetent airline in my life. Three days later when I arrived at my destination, my luggage (you guessed it) was missing, despite me asking at check-in to make sure my bag would be loaded and receiving reassurance it would. It only arrived in the country a week later, less than 24 hrs before my scheduled return flight to the UK. But to make it worse, it could not be delivered to the address I was staying at, until two days later. If I wanted to have it on the same day, I had the option of driving 120 km to the airport myself and collecting it (which I did). I have filed a claim for the accommodation, meals and other expenses, they have refused to compensate for anything saying it was not their fault I misconnected and the wait for the jetty was not as I remember. It would make sense if the other passengers had all made it, but when 18 PAX misconnect it`s an indication it was not really possible to connect in the first place.

We were crammed onto a shuttle bus and transported to the security checkpoint. Plane disembarkation to security checkpoint took about 25-30 minutes. Our next flight was with Air France and the scheduled layover was 1hr 40mins. Massive lineup at the security checkpoint and were shunted to a severely understaffed overflow line. This overflow line had approx. 3 planes worth of passengers and they were being screened by 1 staff member using an old system ¨C baggage and security trays were ferried by hand, no automation whatsoever. There was a free line next to us but that was exclusively for the 20 or so flight staff, all other passengers were ignored. It took 1hr and 10mins to get through the security checkpoint. There were arguments with passengers and staff, there were arguments with passengers and passengers as people were beginning to panic that they were about to miss their connecting flights. People were begging each other to be let through first, but all were in the same situation. Other lines to our right were moving quickly again but people were expressly forbidden by staff from transferring lines, nor did they offer to redirect.

Usually when you are forced to wait 12 hours because your airline cancels your flight, you are offered a minimum of 600 Euro compensation (this is even written on the Air France info site).

First of all, my cancelled flight 814 originated in Paris, which in the middle of the EU. Secondly, since when does an international airline that flies all over the world, compensate only those who fly witin the EU?

The aircraft¡¯s wheels were exceptionally squeaky, and they screeched loudly constantly while we were on the ramp. Also, the food was terrible. It was a sloppy cream cheese and cucumber ¡°sandwich¡±. It was barely edible. They forced us to check our bags in the first case despite there being plenty of open seats and thus, room to carry our bags onto the plane like normal.

Poor catering on board, and on a nine-hour flight no one came to offer more drinks. I went to the back to fetch my own but found that the cabin crew had sealed off our compartment (limiting 16 rows to one toilet) with locked curtains, so they can be alone. Upon arrival, there was no wheelchair for me (and this happens all the time at CDG airport). I have an artificial leg and it is difficult for me to walk long distances, yet they have me walk up the boarding bridge to the lobby, then walk outside to catch their van, where it drops you off at another terminals and you have to walk up steps and then an elevator and then a longish walk to where they have their wheelchair staff. If you wish to fly with this group, choose KLM who are efficient, they have wheelchairs available when you arrive, take you to where you want to go. We flew to Bucharest, and there has never been a wheelchair waiting for me so I guess they do not do that there. My last three trips with AF/KLM have resulted in delayed suitcases of up to a week.

From start to finish, it was a series of mishaps and poor service that left me deeply stressed and unsatisfied. The outbound flight from Zurich was delayed by more than 30 minutes. This delay put us in a precarious situation, and we were forced to rush to catch our connecting flight at Paris CDG. The stress of almost missing our connection was certainly not the ideal way to begin a vacation. On the return journey, the problems persisted. The flight from Antananarivo to Paris CDG experienced another significant delay, causing us to miss our initial connection to Amsterdam. While we were rebooked on a later flight, the flight from Paris CDG to Amsterdam was delayed by 30 minutes. In an attempt to ensure we caught our connection in Amsterdam, we requested assistance from a flight attendant, only to be met with a disrespectful attitude and a dismissive response. Upon arriving in Zurich, the troubles continued as our luggage was nowhere to be found. Three of our bags were stuck in Amsterdam, and one in Paris CDG. We were left waiting for over 2 hours and 30 minutes for our luggage from Amsterdam to arrive in Zurich. This was particularly distressing because two of us had another flight scheduled for the following day and were uncertain whether our luggage would make it in time. As a result, we also missed our train connection from Zurich Airport to Thun. To top it all off, the in-flight meals provided by Air France were subpar at best. On the way to Antananarivo, the tomato salad had a rotten taste, and for a 10-hour flight, the meal options were shockingly limited. On the return journey, the meals were disappointing, with the second meal consisting of bread with some sauce, a cold mini croissant, a jam, and a yogurt. In summary, my experience with Air France on this trip was marred by delays, unhelpful staff, lost luggage, and inadequate in-flight meals.

Sitting in an Air France plane waiting during delayed boarding is torture given the NOISE that is played. Made by a 12 year old who knows three chords and got his hands on a synthesizer? Awful. Same mind numbing noise if you call AF. Flying in ¡°comfort¡± Premium Economy for $3,660 RT is horrendously overpriced given the food and lack of attention. This was a fairly common Business Class fare. Except for a seat that is less uncomfortable than in economy and a pouch with a toothbrush etc., there is nothing to justify the price difference. Dinners were served, both ways, with a main dish in a rectangular box hidden in mashed potatoes. Return flight I chose duck. Sounds nice, right? More like pre- chewed something mixed with, or hidden underneath, mashed potatoes. On neither flight (to and from Paris) did anybody stop to ask if I would like another wine or more water. No drinks before dinner. Nothing to differentiate this ¡°Premium class¡± from economy. Stewards steamed backwards with cart returning from economy without so much as looking sideways to quickly reach the sanctity of the galley between business class and the Premium Economy. You will not get any kind of service or attention that differentiates you from those in economy seats. It may be Air France¡¯s intention that there should be a difference, but I have on my three flights with AF this year seen none of it! None. While there are three or four bathrooms provided for business class in front of you, you will in the Premium section have longest walk to a bathroom of any passenger onboard. True! As I saw that many passengers (especially couples) are in their 60s and 70s this is another reason this Premium section does not warrant its price. The walk back through the economy section in the dark with pillows, blankets, and feet in the way is no fun. In reaching the very back of the plane there were three thin brown sandwiches in a large box waiting, together with a few chewable candies also in a large box and two stewardesses far less interested in engaging with a passenger than in talking among themselves. And it is especially here that KLM has a leg up on Air France. More often, but not always, do KLM personnel seem more friendly and engaging. With reference to my observations in the above, try KLM premium and compare for yourself. The Air France lounge is nice, but if given the opportunity, check out KLM¡¯s main lounge in Amsterdam. Also very nice. Conclusion, suffer economy for 8.5 to 10.5 hours and treat yourself (with the significant amount of money not wasted) to a nicer hotel and great and expensive meal upon arrival! And, on this particular flight, you will guaranteed be closer to bathroom if you book an economy seat! I personally prefer KLM, but when I need a flight on short notice it is usually AF that have tickets. For me, a Delta flight involves a stopover in the US, and is typically more expensive to boot.",negative,-0.525763,0,90,9.826499,6.990257

Overall, it was a very disappointing experience that did not meet our expectations. On September 28, we boarded our flight from Rabat to Paris. The business class seats were barely an upgrade from economy, with limited recline and lacking amenities. The meal service was lacking - a small cold pasta salad and no appetizer or dessert. Upon arriving at CDG, there was no priority boarding or fast track security for business class passengers. We waited in a long queue for 35 minutes to board our connecting flight to Manchester. Again, the business class meal was mediocre - a small cold sandwich. On our return journey on October 1, we decided to fly economy class. Our flight from Manchester departed 15 minutes late. We were anxious about missing our connection in Paris due to the delay. The food was disappointing. Our flight landed in Paris 25 minutes late, giving us under 40 minutes to catch our connection to Rabat. We rushed through the airport and reached the gate just in time. However, upon landing in Rabat, we were informed that our checked luggage had been left behind in Paris. We had to return to the airport at 11:30pm when Air France sent the bags on a later flight.

We were flying back to Johannesburg for our wedding and so wanted the experience to be slightly more special. Paid for an upgrade to business class at the airport for Paris to JHB. Firstly, we received better drinks service in economy coming back than going out in business class. After our boarding drink was poured and we were in the air I asked if I could get a drink, twice, to once be told they would be with me soon, and when we were still ignored my partner then asked for a whiskey and he was told you can wait till after dinner. I understand that if you have been drinking prior to your flight and appear intoxicated, then you are not going to be served. However, we had just gotten off of our flight from Edinburgh to Paris which we had not drunk on. This flight was delayed. We were unable to make use of any of the time in the airport lounge which had been included in our flight upgrade, so hadn't had anything to drink during our time through CDG either.  Also, this doesn't even include WiFi. Secondly, at check in we were unable to upgrade on our return as the flight was full. When I discussed the delay on our last flight and our missed opportunity to utilise the lounge included with our previous upgrade she shrugged and said she didn't know and I should ask someone else. The food was bad with no in flight options provided. Only veggie, with both main and side vegetables overcooked. There is zero quality for the economy class customer experience which is ironic considering they were the most expensive of the three airline options between us and our guests who either flew British Airways or Qatar. We paid (not including our upgrade) ?650 per adult return in comparison to ?600 for BA and ?500 for Qatar (all EDI to JHB). And again, despite being the most expensive, this included no checked baggage. Finally, my decision to never fly Sky Team again was cemented when I realised that I had not packed my toothpaste into my hand luggage on the economy fight back, so asked a stewardess if I could please have some to brush my teeth. Initially she told me they don't carry any toothpaste on board. When I didn't walk away she finally agreed that yes they do have toothpaste on board in the Business class flight bags but these are only for business class.

They only give two times something to eat.

Another client arrived who was scheduled on an earlier flight, she allowed him to check in an extra luggage for free. I responded by saying that was such a nice gesture on her behalf, and it would be appreciated if that kindness spread to others like me....to please give me a solution. No response. I went to the next agent who was a little more helpful and told me to try the upgrade on the machine. (Even though there were no other customers to serve). I went to the self-operated check in machine and succeed to find the seats I wanted but it would not accept any credit card and redirected me to the counter.

Finally, I wanted their names which they completely refused to give, therefore I photographed them so that you can identify these rude agents and retrain their customer care service skills, or better yet give them a job that they do not have to deal with people.

I got off to check and saw my daughter's foot was stuck in this big gap as you see in the picture, by the metal piece stretching across the seat. This piece was visible and the cushion was falling off. I called the attendant and she quickly informed the chief steward who came and pulled the cushion away to seal it back to cover the metal piece.

This flight lacked the services, food by Chef Mashama Bailey (or the Delta Business Class menu ¨C we were served the economy class menu), wine, airplane, and staff that was purchased. The food, wine, flight accommodations, and staff were significant changes to the flight itinerary. This was terrible! This was my elderly mother¡¯s last international flight, and your team should be ashamed for their lack of service, deceptive and unfair practices, while not fulfilling services purchased on this flight.",negative,-0.63599,1,89,9.698,6.182085
? Trip Verified ,,Business,Premium Economy,Munich to Ajaccio via Paris,23-Jul,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," I would like to express my dissatisfaction with my recent flight experience with Air France. Unfortunately, my trip was marked by a significant delay, inadequate accommodations, and disproportionate treatment regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. First and foremost, my flight experienced a 2-hour delay, which resulted in a missed connecting flight at CDG to AJA and disrupted my plans. The lack of effective communication and frequent updates on the flight status only exacerbated my frustration and discomfort throughout the waiting period. Furthermore, the accommodations provided by Air France were extremely disappointing. The hotel where I was accommodated was of inferior quality, with poor conditions and lack of air conditioning. The unbearable heat made my stay even more unsatisfactory and affected my rest before continuing with the journey. Lastly, I would like to mention the excessively strict attitude regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. I was surprised by a severe reprimand from the airline staff due to just 700 grams over the limit in my carry-on bag, even though it was the same bag I boarded with in MUC. This disproportionate approach and disrespectful treatment left me extremely disappointed with the service provided. As a customer, I expected a comfortable and professional flight experience, but unfortunately, Air France did not meet my expectations. I request that you review your customer service policies with the aim of preventing other passengers from going through similar experiences in the future. As a result of this negative experience, I categorically state that I do not intend to fly with Air France again. I hope that this situation will be treated seriously, and appropriate measures will be taken to remedy the situation.",negative,-0.858831,0,90,9.826499,6.990257

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Paris,23-Jul,3,2,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  I have flown with Air France regularly because it is the only direct flight from South Africa to France where I study. I have always been surprised by how poor the food and service are on the route I take, but my last trip took Air France's utter disregard for passengers to a new level. After the plane was in Johannesburg for a whole day (available to be inspected and to make sure that everything on the plane was working) the flight got cancelled when we were already all boarded and ready to go when the pilot announced an issue with the air conditioning system. Even though I believe this was ridiculous already given all the time they had to check the plane, the worst was yet to come. The pilot gave a very unsympathetic announcement after we were sitting on the plane for two hours already that the flight is cancelled. Nothing else. The cabin crew advised us that the ground crew will assist us. Except that there were no ground crew when we got off the plane. One lady behind an obscure desk had no idea what was going on and a gent with her merely said to all the passengers that they should sort themselves out with accommodation, food and travel to the accommodation and then claim back. If all of this was already ridiculous, the worse was yet to come: trying to process a claim is a nightmare! Air France booked me on another flight 3 days later - without any correspondence with me. If I had taken this flight I would not have been able to graduate this year as I would've missed a key class in my studies. I urgently had to book another flight via Kenya to get to France in time for my classes. The whole process was so badly done that it proofed impossible to cancel the substitute flight without cancelling my return flight as well. There was no way of contacting anybody at Air France to assist in cancelling the replacement flight, but not cancel the return flight. No way to phone or e-mail. Air France doesn't even have an office area in Johannesburg where one can ask for assistance. The website is terrible and the AI used clearly doesn't cope with anything that is not stock standard. I am still struggling to try and process my claim. I have still not managed to connect with anybody at Air France that can assist to sort out the cancelling of the replacement flight. They claim you can connect with them on Messenger or Twitter, but don't be fooled, the AI chat bot doesn't work well and the supposed operators don't contact you as promised by the chat bot. Even the African Airlines are better than Air France. The customer service on Air France is terrible and it is clear they have no intent of actually providing a decent customer experience. Not on the plane, on the ground, on their website or in Charles de Gaulle airport.

I flew to Paris with my friend at the end of May and at the airport was informed that even though we paid and did everything correctly with the booking, for some reason tickets were not issued. They let us stay at the airport handing us a paper with contact for AF customer service, where after a longer wait they said they don¡¯t know how to deal with the problem so they have to think about it - I guess not realizing we are under a time pressure and could miss the flight - already in pressure and missed the time we wanted to stay at the airport lounge. After some time, they came up with a solution - to pay for the tickets again, yes, double charge us (in fact it was a triple charge) and said the previous hold would be released within 3 days, which did not happen within the period of time, but in the end it did. They also did not disrespect our selected seat we had chosen in the booking and wanted us to sit separately and also let us wait the line at the counter again, even though we had already waited before and was denied because of the technical issue on their side. After this horrible experience I contacted the airline explaining what a terrible experience we had with them, however we were not asking for any compensation or refund. They replied in quite a long time saying they issued a refund. I was surprised that they actually acknowledged how much they failed, but it was sadly not the thing - for some reason they thought I was asking for a refund because of the previous hold payment, which I was not. That means they did not even read my complaint properly and after another week I received an email my refund was denied. So not even the customer service employees care about the complaints, they probably don¡¯t even read it. This is the worst airline experience we have had so far and we have flown hundreds of flights combined. Thankfully there is a great competition in the European and world airlines market and it¡¯s easy to avoid flying with this terrible airline, which also means avoiding their sister KLM (and whole skyteam) which have allied with this terrible company.

You have to pay 60 euros for hold baggage, and that means that you have to use the machine and then hold the line to load the hold baggage. (Ironically, since my bag was 10kg, less than 12kg, they asked me if I wanted to carry it to the check in). The line got very long, between the weighting line, the hold line, and the check in line, and I almost lost the boarding time. They could just let me pay for my 2 kg extra on the place, and it would have been a normal process. Next time I will try to avoid Air France.",negative,-0.74009,0,90,9.826499,6.990257

I could have been just a uncomfortable in Economy for several hundred dollars less. Food service was indistinguishable from economy. The seat was a bit wider but only reclined two inches. The space under the seat in front of me where I would have liked to stretch my knee-replacement legs was bisected by the legs supporting the seat. The foot rest and leg support were no help. Cabin service first round was a 6 ounce cup of Coke with no ice. Next cabin service came seven hours later. Same thing. So much for Premium Economy. The real treat came when we arrived on Monday May 29 in Naples, Italy. Our baggage failed to make the trip. So we stood at the baggage claim office in line for an hour to get what is called a ""Property Irregularity Report."" Meanwhile the driver who came to pick us up to drive us to Sorrento more than an hour away gave up on us and left. It took an international phone call to get him to return. We stayed in Sorrento until the morning of June 2 when we left for Rome. Our baggage finally arrived at the hotel 5 PM the night before we left. Four days without baggage. Air France did send an email with an apology for the inconvenience and admitted they were at fault for taking so long to return the bags.

? Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,New York JFK to Istanbul via Paris CDG,23-Jun,1,2,1,2,2,1,1,no,2," Would definitely never fly again with Air France or Delta. 1) I got my ticket from Delta and upgraded later to Premium Economy. The email I got from Delta says that my second checked luggage is free from JFK to IST (see attached photo). Air France ground crew at JFK said that it is free only for JFK to CDG and that I had to pay for CDG to IST although my bags were going directly to IST after checking in. Delta should have informed better as their email was grossly misleading. 2) My Premium Economy seat footrest was broken. It was basically not there so probably people who sat at this seat put their feet on the back pocket of the seat in-front of me so that was also broken (see attached photo). For an upgraded seat that I paid extra for it was uncomfortable and not worth it. A cabin crew member came later and told me they will send me a discount coupon of 45 euros on my next flight ticket with Air France and that is the only thing that they can do. 3) On both ways in CDG transfer while going to the US and coming back from the US and flying to IST there is a security control with long lines. Getting just out of one flight trying to catch another and you are again stuck with a security control. Overall I am very unhappy with my choices and would probably never fly again with Air France or Delta. And probably direct flight from Turkey to US would be better because the CDG is also not very entertaining and has very little options due to terminals/gates in terms of services, shops, food and lounges. These tickets are not cheap even if they are not upgraded and still the service and aircraft are not up to the standards.

It was extremely well designed with an excellent screen, solid table, privacy, ample storage spaces and the ability to locate switches and power points without searching too hard. We were offered a glass of champagne, juice or water before takeoff and given a very impressively comprehensive menu. I had pre-ordered the fish and it was incredibly tasty and excellently served by the cabin crew. I chose the delicious Chablis which seems to work well at altitude. It is an overnight flight and after the meal lights were dimmed. Although it was a flat bed seat I always believed that one sleeps better if it is at a slight angle ¨C especially as aircraft never fly exactly horizontally. Despite only a blanket and pillow I had one of the most comfortable nights ever on an aircraft. I was awoken from breakfast and shown the omelette. This, I knew, never works that well but it was still tasty and accompanied by bread and fruit. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were absolutely excellent. Every request was answered and they were friendly, funny at times, very French (of course) and a credit to the airline.

US passport holders have an extra long line to weigh their baggage. The person weighing the baggage before this flight asked the passenger ahead of me in line to weigh her bags. When the bag was lower than the allowed weight, he asked her to put her shawl and jacket onto the scale. Then he shouted out ¡®It is overweight, go and pay 100$ and check it in¡¯.  I went twice through the line, after removing and throwing away some of my luggage the first time. The second time, he put a red tag and asked me to pay excess baggage. There were some people around the corner, who were in conversation with this person weighing the bags in French. They asked me for cash and told me I had to pay there to get my baggage on the plane. I gave them cash, and a woman then took me to a long line and left me with some strangers saying they will take me in with the luggage. I soon realized this was the line for Business class and I was on the wrong line. By the time I went to the baggage counter to pay for extra luggage, it was too late to check-in my bag as the time for that had lapsed. So they made me throw away most of my luggage to make it a carry-on. The next flight was only two hours away.

Air France is in reality operated as a budget airline, because, unlike Airasia et al, they don't sell tasty food on board. So my advice is bring a substantial picnic because, after an early lunch, you will get nothing to eat for 9 hours.

At check-in, I encountered the most grim looking row of agents I'd ever seen. I understand they had to stay at work longer due to the delayed flight, but that isn't my fault and I expect some smiles and basic courtesy when checking in, particularly on a costly business class ticket. After completing check-in, I noticed that my bag tag was completely illegible because the printer was running out of ink. I returned to the check-in counter where I approached an agent who appeared to be lead agent on duty that night. I asked him in French if my bag tag can please be reprinted as it was unreadable. He started yelling at me (in French), ""Who did you see when you checked in...go to that person"". I stopped all proceedings and firmly responded, ""Why are you speaking to me like that!?"". He then told me curtly that the bag had already been sent for loading onto the aircraft. I told him that I was well aware of how the baggage system works, but I had simply asked if my bag tag could be reprinted. He continued to give me rude responses, at which point I told him to go into the system and find my baggage tag number and write it legibly on my boarding pass. I then went to the Air France station manager's office and complained. Shameful treatment of a high revenue passenger. Flights were fine. Air France lounges in Paris should stock non-alcoholic beer.

The food quality was also poor. All take off and landing announcements from the cockpit were in French, not in English. The cabin crew manager talked to French passengers but never once spoke to me once during the flight.

Delta re-routed me ATL-CDG-LIS via partnership with Air France, and give me an upgrade to ""Business"" (due to the equivalent class was not available, but the ""Business"" still shows availability.) At the gate, Air France counter person insulted me: ""You have only paid $300 and want to fly Business""? I was trying to inquire if she was looking at my ATL to JFK portion of fare as I actually paid 3 times as much for my round trip. After she downgraded me and issued my ATL-CDG boarding pass, I requested the second portion (CDG-LIS), and told her I wanted to see a manager. She yelled at me: ""I am the manager!"" when I requested to see her badge (as she was wearing her badge front side inward), she replied: ""You cannot see my badge."" When I insisted, she said: ""I am deboarding you now!"" and she did knock on the keyboard to start the deboarding! At this time, a Delta counter person printed out CDG-LIS boarding pass for me. The nightmare continued in CDG when I was told I was not in Air France systems, so I cannot fly to LIS. However, the lady at CDG counter immediately escalated and resolved the situation. What a sharp contrast between the two employees from the same company! The Air France counter person in Atlanta (I still do not know her name) was rude and was all ""snappy"" and ""powerful"" when dealing with customers. The moment she said ""I am deboarding you now!"" I knew I was not talking to a normal person. While waiting to be boarded, a few other Delta passengers complained that she also charged them luggage fees - ignoring Delta policies. ""I am deboarding you now!"" was the last nail on the coffin, goodbye Air France! No one flies just for fun, we have destinations, schedules, people to meet and things to do.

At both stations it didn¡¯t take me more than 3 minutes with zero queuing time. At the same time queuing to normal check in desks would have taken good 20 minutes (also quite bearable if you arrive on time). My first flight was delayed by 1 hour. The delay was managed perfectly. Push notification and email on the mobile phone with new estimated boarding time and gate number, instant update of the boarding pass via app and proper announcement at the gate. Inflight information on missed and rescheduled connections was sufficient and clear. In the air they have managed to serve small snack with round if drinks (tea, coffee, soda, beer, wine). I purchased inflight internet access. The price was ok, speed was fine for browsing websites. If you need just messaging you can get a free plan for the whole duration of your flight. Cabin was clean and fresh (brand new A220) with reasonable comfort. On the way back it was HOP (regional subsidiary of AF) with older E190. Embraer fleet have no onboard internet access, but otherwise they are more comfortable with wider seats and more legroom. Service standard was identical to AF mainline with super friendly and professional crews. HOP flights use 2G terminal at CDG which is a small regional terminal located afar from the main area where all big terminals are. It requires a separate bus ride in addition to rail or bus city link, so mind it and allow extra 20 minutes if you¡¯re leaving from there.

As a consequence, I do not have clothes to work tomorrow, neither for my gym session. Additionally, I have my winter jacket in the missing baggage. Being in Prague and being in winter, I can not go anywhere without it. For this reason, I am going to buy at least some business clothes and gym clothes so I can make it through the day tomorrow. Air France does not want to compensate for any of the costs involved on this as they say I have a permanent, and not a temporary address. I do not care what the policy say, this is going to cost me money and make me waste time. Being such a well known company, I trusted Air France. The whole experience of missing a baggage starts on the airport, where you are waiting for longer as your bags do not come. Then filling all the paperwork on the baggage claim desk. Afterwards, having to call the company and waiting for customer service to answer so you can get to follow up your case with disappointment to hear that it is not going to make it on the right time.

I called Air France Spain yesterday and the representative reopened the claim for investigation into whether or not the payment was initiated or not or if I may need to provide additional bank account information.

So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation.

Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available!

I did not even take a shower in case the driver came with my bag at exactly that time. This was a blatant lie by the driver. I then insisted that they make a delivery and I now have another two interval I need to block in the evening. In the best case scenario, I will have spent my entire day waiting at home for a bag.

From NY to Paris we we golden. Smooth as silk. We took off he ate and slept. We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed. Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began. He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off. Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon). He was rejecting all toys and foods.

It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available. BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers? I found that interesting and don't know why. Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days. My salute to the air crew that day.

On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back.

I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France? To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months. In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed. I've tried multiple channels to reach ANYONE who can help, but each time I was told there is nobody who can help you, sir.

That seemed strange to me, so I asked the stewardess in English if that was the right thing to do and she only said that the hold was full and the suitcase was loaded in the back. That struck me as odd, too, but that could be the case, I thought to myself and sat down again. More suitcases arrived, still being loaded into the same hold (so apparently the hold wasn't full after all). Meanwhile, my suitcase was still lying on the back of the car. At some point no more suitcases came and the loading belt was retracted. So I went to the stewardess again and told her that my suitcase is still on the back of this car and that the luggage strap is now being removed. After a short discussion, she fetched the pilot, who left the plane with my suitcase badge. I looked out the window and unfortunately the car on which my suitcase was lying was gone now too. After a minute or two the pilot came back and just said don't worry my suitcase will be on board. Then I just said if he was sure, because the last time I checked, my suitcase was still on the car and the luggage strap was retracted. The stewardess then answered me something in French, I just said that unfortunately I don't speak French and that's why I had spoken to her in English beforehand, she answered in French again. I sat down again and during the pushback I saw all the trolleys lined up and of course my suitcase was still on one of these trolleys.  My suitcase arrived in D¨¹sseldorf the next evening, one of the four wheels had broken off, a wheel bearing had broken out, one of the two locks had broken and the suitcase was so warped that it could no longer be closed. A Rimowa aluminum case that has endured a lot for 8 years. The destruction of the suitcase, of course has more to do with Paris Airport, but the whole thing would probably not have happened like this if my suitcase had been loaded, because as the next to the baggage carousel at the airfield, all 4 wheels were still attached.

I reached out to customer service using the 800 237 2747 which is not even located in France (it is a call center in India) who have informed me several times, all I needed to do was submit an online claim for hotel accommodation on our 10 hour overnight layover. When I submit the online claim they tell me to call back the 800 number who then informed me I need to reach out through Facebook messenger. On that communication I was informed I should ask for accommodation in person when I get to Paris. Upon our arrival in Paris at 11.40pm the customer service informed us they will not be providing us with hotel accommodation since we bought the ticket knowing there was a layover. They only provide accommodation if your flight is canceled or delayed. This did not make sense because all of their flights from Greece to Washington, D.C. had layovers at the time of our booking. This was completely new information for us since we have been communicating with their customer service for over three weeks before our travel which could have made our own hotel booking if they didn't lead us to believe they will provide one for us. Because we arrived around midnight there was no hotel available for us during our layover and we had to sleep at the airport. We are absolutely disappointed with how they handled the conversation at their customer service office in Paris where we were told, ¡°sorry you received misinformation but since our call center is not in France we cannot control what information they give.¡± This is the first airline we know of that have no control over their customer service. We will never use this airline and I advise anyone who might have similar flying scenario to make your own accommodation regardless of what the customer service tells you.

Luckily they noticed it and firmly directed the passenger back to the queue. This could have been an administrative if not security problem. On board the service was efficient and pleasant. We were delighted to find that AF served a decent snack on short-haul flights (a sandwich plus a choice of alcoholic or soft drinks). Probably because of the slow boarding process at Heathrow our first leg to CDG operated 25 minutes late, resulting in us having to sprint up and down staircases at CDG to catch our onward flight to Lisbon.

The AF customer service in Paris Orly were really difficult to deal with, they will ignore you if they don't like the question (asked for directions on how to get to the airport hotel and how I can do an online claim on the issue), some of them will yell in frustration if you ask the same question twice (I was really tired and I couldn't really hear them well over the counter).

First, we were overcharged for our bags going from Paris to Nice. When we arrived the kiosks charged us $70, but it was only supposed to be $45. I tried to ask multiple Air France representatives for help and everyone ignored us and kept walking by. Since no one would help, we paid the $70 to get out of there. But one of our bag tags was missing. We paid for 3 $70 tags but we only received 2 printed. So we had to go get in line for a representative to help us. The line was long and moving slow. Once we got to the front, the Ai France representative confirmed that we were not supposed to be charged $70/bag we were only supposed to pay $45/bag. But he said he couldn¡¯t issue a refund and we would have to file a claim which we are doing now. But he was trying to make us pay $45 again for the missing bag tag. He printed the tag for us and we put it on our bag, but after he realized I wasn¡¯t going to pay the $45, since I already paid $70 for it, he ripped the tag off my bag.  I requested a manager and the manager told him he was wrong, and reprinted us a tag and told us to get in line to drop off our bags. This drop off line was so long and there was only 1 person at the front desk with 10+ stations. Finally when we got to the front, the third bag tag wouldn¡¯t scan, so again we needed assistance which took pulling teeth to get. We waited and no one would help. Finally a manager saw us and took us to the side station, reprinted yet another tag and checked the bag for us and sent us to security to go to our gate.

I didn't watch any movies, but I peeked at the selection and it was very large and there were films that came out recently or great classics. Super positive note the wifi is free for everyone just to send light messages (no audio, no photos) but if you pay you can get it faster! The seats were very uncomfortable for me, my seat was dirty, crumbs on the seat and food stains on the table. In times of covid this is very serious for me. The Air France site is difficult to handle. I wanted to change my flight, I did all the steps and then it gave me ERROR, and when I returned to the original booking page they canceled the seats I had purchased in advance ... luckily I contacted the company via messenger and they put everything back to normal! In the end I discovered that to change the flight you have to call a number. But be prepared, if you call the number from Japan you will have to wait 30/40 minutes !!

However, all 5 of our bags were missing when we got home. It has been 5 days and countless phone calls and nothing has been done to tell us where our bags are or when to expect them. Items include stroller, car seat, and breast pump so my wife can provide milk to feed our son. All of these items had to be replaced because we cannot wait in limbo for them. Their call service automatically drops your call if it is longer than a 45min wait time so if you do not call at the exact minute of their opening you are more than likely not going to be able to speak to a customer service agent.

Unnecessarily rude flight staff. Stay away upon arrival to the airport, we were told that our cabin bags had to go in the hold because the flight was at (or near) maximum capacity. When our bags came out of the hold, my laptop display was broken. I work remotely and so had to replace this instantly, and getting in contact with Air France has been an absolute nightmare. Firstly, I called their customer service lines several times. Every time is the same result - a string of employees with no understanding of what I'm saying, who direct me back and fourth across various different departments, often knowingly directing me to the wrong department just to get me to shut up. I submitted a claim to Air France directly 3 weeks ago and have still received no response. I've updated the claim several times, they are just ignoring me. Furthermore, on our outbound flight, there was sick on the seat. This being a 13 hour flight, we understandably asked a member of the team to move seats. She then came back with tissues and began wiping the seat. When my girlfriend stated that we didn't want it cleaned but rather wanted to move seats (the mess was really bad and smelt absolutely vile), the staff member very rudely and patronisingly said 'one minute' and then continued to rub the crime scene with her clearly inadequate bits of tissue. we eventually got her to agree to move our seat. We went and sat at the front where she told us to. A man comes over, head of the on-board team, and starts having a go at us for being in the wrong seat. We tried to tell him 'another staff member moved us here' but he sadly went on to repeatedly tell us to move for about 5 minutes, before eventually realising what we are saying, apologising, and leaving us in peace in our new seats. On our inbound flight, we did not receive the veggie meals we asked for. The lady just said 'No' repeatedly in again, an unnecessarily patronising tone, and continuously denied that we had requested vegetarian meals. She offered us meat meals instead. After we made it very clear that we were unhappy, we were given an armful of bread rolls and cheese to resolve the issue, as we'll as an extra desert and one pasta dish. This may have been the best they could do at the time, but was not exactly sufficient for a 13 hour flight. Furthermore, we've checked our booking and it clearly shows that we asked for vegetarian meals. This was just one return booking, and they did so many things wrong.

They stated my carry on or purse needed to be paid for and put through baggage or I needed to remove items and throw them out. I had to go all the way back and pay for my carry on luggage that did not have a lock and had valuable items in it to be put through with baggage.

? Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Paris to Miami,21-Nov,3,4,3,5,5,5,4,yes,8,"  First medium-haul experience with Air France. This is part of a connecting flight from LHR-MIA via CDG. Check-in at LHR was swift, thanks to Sky Priority (customers flying Premium Economy get Sky Priority access). Due to COVID, check-in meant extra checks and formalities during check-in. All my documents were verified in less than 20 minutes. I received my onward boarding pass to MIA. This is my first medium-haul trip with Air France. The equipment used on this flight was a 10 year old Boeing 777-300ER. I was among the first passengers to board this full and busy flight. The cabin crew upon boarding were very friendly and warm. The plane was in an immaculate condition and was kept very clean. We left 45 minutes behind schedule due to technicalities and the crew gave regular updates. After take off, the crew sprung into action. They distributed a sanitary kit which consisted of a mask, alcohol surface wipes and hand sanitiser. We were told that unfortunately, amenity kits were not loaded on this flight and the crew were very apologetic. The meal service was swift but was done with care. Lunch served was good in quality but lacking in quantity which is the only downside. The crew were also very proactive with the drinks service. After the main meal service, cabin lights were switched off and were invited to help ourselves to the self-help snack bar which was adequately stocked with drinks and snacks. The second meal service came in a rather chic paper bag which consisted of a warm sandwich, a bread roll, a muffin, a chocolate bar, orange juice and a yoghurt drink. In addition, drinks were served again. For a 9 hour flight, the quality of the meals served was good but lacking in quantity. Air France could perhaps increase their portions when it comes to Premium Economy dining. The seat on this aircraft is Air France's fixed shell seat which mean that rather than reclining, the seat slides forwards so that it does not intrude your personal space. The seat was wide with good cushion padding. The pillow and blanket also appeared to be off higher quality compared to other airlines I've flown with in Premium Economy. The seat also came with a leg rest which was a very good addition. Now, there are a lot of negative reviews of this product but I would say that this seat is adequately comfortable for a TransAtlantic flight. My back did get a little sore from the seat sliding forward but I used the pillow to add some padding. I requested for an extra pillow and was given one without hesitancy. As we were flying during COVID, cabin crew and passenger interaction was very minimal to keep each other safe. However, I noted that the crew were very responsive in meeting the needs of the passengers from what I observed. IFE content was outstanding. There were more than enough new Holywood films available and a couple of French, Western, Asian and Bollywood films. In addition, the IFE offering also had plenty of radio stations and Album selections. In addition, the plan is equipped with an external camera. Air France is nowhere near a perfect carrier as there are things that Air France could do better in terms of its Premium Economy service which in my opinion would be: increasing portion sizes of meals and offering a bar service as only red wine was offered during the drinks service. Overall, Air France is a great alternative to fly across the Atlantic!",positive,0.584978,1,88,9.076123,-7.247081

While frustrating, this sometimes can't be helped, especially with COVID and the winter weather. However, my flights were cancelled a total of three times, costing me $450 in COVID test fees, as well as $300 in hotel costs to stay near the airport due to the last minute cancellations and rebookings. Very poor communication from staff to passengers about what was happening with flights - we were sat for over an hour after the initial departure time waiting to hear what was happening, only to be repeatedly told we would be boarding ""soon"", followed by the surprise news that our flight was cancelled. It's incredibly frustrating to have to relay the messages back to my manager back home, and pray the next flight I book won't be cancelled. I understand that the current global situation has placed pressured on airlines, and I wouldn't be leaving a bad review over one cancelled flight. But to be told the flights will ""definitely"" be going ahead, and to be cancelled again and again, is frustrating and unprofessional for everyone involved. It also seems that very few other flights are having this happen to them, and even when I've flown during other points of the pandemic, I've never faced such poor communication and repeated cancellations. Staff were polite, but misinformation was still given, and everything felt poorly organised and poorly communicated to the staff left to answer questions to the stranded passengers.

I tried multiple times to reach the airline for help and the line hung up automatically after playing a message about the wait time. I would have gladly waited to speak with anyone. Multiple online searches with this airline showed no other flights available to my destination so I had to book a new reservation with a different carrier at more than double the cost ($1400 vs my original $600!).

Catering was also a bit on a low-side: salad was tasty, although no hot food on a 3.5 hour flight, only one kind of tea, not even basic things like lemon is given. CDG is a very confusing airport by its layout, although there were many staff members navigating passengers,  making the transfer efficient. A CDG - LHR leg was uneventful, a typical 1-hour intra-European hop, however, with extremely uncomfortable business class seats. A foie gras as a snack was a very nice touch. All in all, a decent experience for an EU airline. Air France nowadays seems to be a nice option to accrue a good bunch of miles subject to an attractive fare and if they schedule a widebody on a Moscow flight. However, in all other respects, I would strongly prefer KLM as a peer transit airline: they fly from LCY, their Schiphol hub is much much better for transit, the narrowbody seats are way more comfortable and staff generally better.

I found the seat weird with an oddly positioned aisle side armrest. In the flat position, you feel like you are in a coffin. Food was utterly unremarkable - a pity given that it is a carrier from France which has such wonderful food. The selection of movies was large, but didn't have much of interest. I asked for a second cup of chamomile tea and was told they had run out .. seriously? i have brought my own tea bags if I knew they'd run out of it in business class.

The good experience was really down to a fabulous crew. Very professional and charming. The food & beverages was really good. It seems like out of CDG the on board experience has really picked up since I last flew AF out of CDG just prior to covid. Great selections and quality along with awesome presentation. The 787 is really great for long haul. Good seats, good entertainment, quiet cabin and good amenities. Arrived in DTW approx 45 mins ahead of schedule. The bad part is the ground service. I'm sure the rush to travel now restrictions are being eased does not help, but at both LIS and CDG the boarding process is pandemonium. No-one seems to understand zoned boarding, so you literally have to fight your way through throngs of people to board at your allotted time. The paperwork for Covid related info at CDG was never addressed over the PA, but there was a table (without pens) and some papers that should be filled out, but no-one working the gate said anything until you were scanning your BP with the gate agent, so many people would then retreat back to the table and back through the line of passengers waiting to board. To cap all this, a PAX traveling with her 7 YO son was denied boarding and caused a major commotion for about 20 mins as she had been misinformed about her sons test. OK maybe this isn't on Air France, but from what she screamed to the security agents would suggest she had been given the wrong info by Air France the previous day when she was denied boarding because she didn't have the correct test to travel to USA. After getting the required test she arrived at the gate of my flight only to be denied because her son had not been tested. I know this is 100% on the passenger, but she had been misinformed about this requirement by AF the previous day in regards to her son, so certainly have some sympathy for her. Overall it added enormously to the chaos and CDG is not best equipped to have an entire widebody's load of PAX jostling and not observing any kind of distancing. Apart from the poor ground service the only negative thing while in the air was the terrible wifi.

Air France has not offered me any sort of assistance, no meal vouchers, no courtesy call, no hotel accommodation, no transfer voucher or any compensation whatsoever. When I arrived at my final destination (more than two days later) I found out that my suitcase was also lost by the airline. No compensation for that either, no apologies from the airline. Just saying nothing is their fault. Why did I misconnect? After arriving on stand, the Captain told us that there was no ground staff available to operate the jetbridge. So we had to wait. Only one dispatcher for so many flights - the Captain¡¯s words. We were seated on the aircraft for about 45 minutes. Naturally a lot of people started to panic and complain while still on board, heavy arguments started between crew and passengers regarding who should be re-seated, with swear words flying around. After disembarkation a long run started. Be aware, if you are planning to connect at CDG. Most of the airport is closed/unused. Transfer signs are covered with A4 sheets with handwritten ¡°closed¡± notes and arrows on them. Staff are blocking routes and re-directing passengers. Only two immigration officers at transfer area, processing several hundred passengers. Only a few security lines open at transfer area, for a huge crowd of people. Buses between terminals run every half an hour and I am not exaggerating. Air France knows you can¡¯t connect in such a short time, because it¡¯s simply impossible. They will still sell you a ticket. Because they don¡¯t care if you misconnect. Please only try to connect at CDG if you have at least 3 hrs to connect! And the worst of all, after misconnecting, together with approximately 40 other passengers, we went back to the ticket desk to seek assistance. We were immediately told there was no compensation, no assistance and no rebooking. Without even checking our tickets. Several passengers were immediately reduced to tears. I have never in my life encountered such rude, unhelpful and arrogant personnel. If you are unfortunate enough and must travel at these uncertain times due to an emergency, please please avoid Air France and CDG airport, or if you can¡¯t, make sure you have at least an extra EUR 500 in your pocket to cover hotel expenses for yourself. And please check what alternatives you have in case you misconnect. Also, having a through ticket, purchased directly from Air France doesn¡¯t really help either if you misconnect, they will tell you it¡¯s not their fault you misconnected, so they are not obligated to look after you.

However it is difficult to be unimpressed by the A350. Air France's set up is attractive, this aircraft looked very new indeed and was very nicely presented. New economy seats are all uncomfortable in my experience and this was no exception. I had 3 seats to myself so I was very comfortable but had I been in a full plane this would have been a long 11 hours indeed. The seat is pretty hard, the legroom is not bad for the class, one of the benefits of hard seats is their shape seems to generate a bit more space for the person behind. Entertainment system is good but not brilliant like Emirates system. I think you need to download an app before flying to access their wifi. The food was really disappointing. Pasta in a tomato sauce with a grain salad. I know Air France has meals available for purchase prior to flying, it would seem they are trying to push people in that direction as the free option was pretty poor. Staff we generally good, one steward hassled me for not wearing a mask at a time I was drinking water, really annoying but generally the staff were nice. Flying conditions were grim but the A350 skipped above the trouble at 40000 feet, it was bouncy but less modern aircraft would have been all over the place.

I could also see that the amount had been reserved on my MasterCard. The e-mail with the confirmation did not include a lot of information other than a link to the details of my trip online. By accessing the link I could see that everything was in order. The next day, when my travel was supposed to take place, I checked the link once more, but this time nothing showed up. I just got a blank internet site. By contacting the airline, they informed me that my booking was cancelled by them. I had received no information about this from the airline. The given reason was that it was apparently not possible to order a trip from Egypt with Air France online within the last 72 hours before departure. Nothing on their website had indicated this as far as I could see and my booking had through. The man I spoke to had no solution to this problem, but told me I had to personally show up at the airport and order a flight from Air France and pay in cash. I told him I needed a booking to make sure I got a seat, given the coronavirus situation. He made a new booking in my name and told me I had to pay for the tickets at the airport before 22:00 p.m. I went to the airport very early to make sure I would get my ticket in good time, but at the airport there were no one from Air France. By calling them I got information that my second booking also had been cancelled (again with no warning from the airline) and that they wouldn't have personel on the airport until three hours before the flight, meaning not before 22:50 hours p.m. The guy I spoke to this time said he would make a new booking for me, but he could not guarantee that this new booking would also not be cancelled and he could give no guarantee for availability. This was ""not in their policy"", so he could basically do nothing. I asked him if it was in their policy to accept two bookings from a customer, reserve money on their credit card and then cancel the booking twice without giving any information or heads-up to their customer. A question for which their representative had no answer.  I was not willing to take anymore chances of delaying my booking any further, so I booked another trip with Emirates without any issues at all. Now, four days later, on Tuesday 17th march, the amount is still reserved on my MasterCard.

Wines in small bottles on a screw cap; champagne is not bad.

Gate agents did a reasonable job of keeping everyone informed. I had read poor reviews of the Premium Economy seating and was still surprised to discover how uncomfortable the seats were. They do not really recline but slide forward and finding a comfortable seating position was difficult. My wife did better since she is shorter but at almost 6ft I could not get comfortable in the seats at all. Footrest was basically useless. I managed to make the seat a bit more bearable by sitting on the folded blanket and the pillow provided on the seat. The ""inspired gourmet meal"" per the AF website was the same as regular economy and not that inspiring. The appetizer ""inspired by the Business Class menu"" was a meat pate that really didn't pair well with a vegetarian meal. The ""chilled oshibori towel"" was missing, replaced by a wet wipe tossed on the tray table. Service was minimal and indifferent with the crew disappearing right after the meal was served - there were no water runs or crew service for the majority of the flight. In general, the flight experience reflects what seems to become the norm. However, the Premium Economy hype on the Air France website raises unrealistic expectations.

Business class was not offered on the internal France flights. Business class is allowed 2 checked bags. This wasn't a problem on the outbound trip. On our return we had to pay excess baggage fees because the first leg of our flight was economy and we were only allowed 1 bag each. Multiple calls to AF customer service indicates this is their policy. The originating leg dictates the baggage allowance.

It was my first time flying with Air France and the first impression I got after being boarded was the yellowed up plastic around the old screen panel on the back of the seats.  The in-flight entertainment on the A380 was disastrous. To give the impression that they have more movies to offer, a movie with 4 languages would be displayed as 4 movies; touch screen was extremely non-touch-sensitive; screen pivot was broken. The saving grace was that I managed to get some sleep in the air. Air France booked a 75 min transfer for us, and thanks to landing 20 minutes early, we managed to board on time for our connecting to Rome. On our trip back at Rome, ground staff assistance was non-existent, the pre-checked-in queue for bag drop was slower than the normal check-in+bag-drop queue. A queue of 4 parties spent almost an hour moving down the line, I was only moved to the front during last call for check-in...I arrived 2 hours before scheduled departure. Connection in Paris CDG was horrendous, the moment we landed, we had to rush out of the plane, rush to a shuttle to take us to the transit area. It was the longest queue I have seen at an airport passport control. We snuck into a priority queue and went to the front. Alas, after clearance, we had to wait for a shuttle to get to another terminal. At this point, we were almost sure we would miss the flight. Disembarking the shuttle bus, we rushed to the terminal lobby and luckily managed to find our way to our boarding gate at last call. We were so glad Air France booked us on China Eastern.

The seat is not a full-flat with limited recline and quite cramped. Service during the flight was not impressive with FA seemed to be overwhelmed. I was not able to assess IFE since remote control was broken and to press the touch screen all the time was annoying. Food tasted amazingly bland: appetizers including bread seemed to be served directly from the fridge with poor presentation (s. photo). The main course (I had zucchini canneloni) was OK. Fresh fruits for dessert were mashy. Enigmatic was the deck in front of the cabin (s. photo) - the bench imitation was of no use since you slide down when trying to sit on it.

This was one of the many Air France-operated flights that are booked and managed through Delta, and this made the few gate changes and delays we experienced on both legs of the trip more complicated. However, the in-flight experience was pleasant and the aircraft was nice. I prefer Airbuses whenever I can fly them, and Air France does a good job of keeping seat pitch in theirs roomy for economy passengers. At the advice of some other reviewers, we paid the small and reasonable fee each way to ""upgrade"" to the upper deck of the cabin, which is a much more intimate space with a better attendant-to-passenger ratio. The pitch was also about 3' more generous, and the upstairs was a more quiet, warm space than any I've flown internationally. Meals came noticeably quicker in the upper deck, even considering that we were some of the last people upstairs to be served, and I did not run into a waiting line for the restroom once on either leg of the trip. I did not book in time to get an upper deck window seat, but I'd heard about the added bonus of a storage container that these passengers got included in the same ticket price I paid. I was in the middle but had a woman to my left without someone next to her, and I saw her window seat storage bin first-hand. It was big and literally fit all of her odds-and-ends. It was awesome and another reason to book this seat if you can. Well worth the money. Crew was friendly, food was okay but warm and well-portioned, and the in-flight entertainment was good. The only real negatives were the complications of booking Air France through Delta, which I feel created more delays and gate changes than would have occurred if I'd booked direct.

This flight wasn¡¯t our first choice, as we were originally booked on a Air Mauritius flight, but were rebooked to this Air France flight because of the cancellation of the Air Mauritius flight (we knew this 2,5 months before departure). When we checked in online we were assigned two aisle seats on row 22. When we later checked our seats in the Air France app again we found out we were assigned different seats; row 20 and 54! The reason of this was a equipment change; Air France was operating a less dense 777-300ER with a lot less Economy class seats. During check in we adressed the seat issue and lucky we got new seats; 47A and B. When we sat down we felt extremely cramped; the seats were very uncomfortable with terrible leg room and appealing shoulder space. Air France is operating the 777 in a 3x4x3 configuration, and  this cramped configuration is used with an increasing amount of airlines. The PTVs were of good quality with decent content; movies, series, music, games, interactive map and a front camera. The cabin crew was very professional, proactive and polite. Both meals (dinner and breakfast) were of a good quality, but a bit small. Last but not least, the temperature on board was extremely hot during the first few hours. We addressed this to the crew and they acknowledge, but couldn¡¯t do anything about it as the system was not reacting properly. To sum up; this was my first and most definitely last experience on board of an Air France 777-300ER. The service was fine but the seat discomfort made it one of my most uncomfortable flights ever. I would certainly fly Air France again (this was my fifth flight with them), but only if it isn¡¯t a Boeing 777!",negative,-0.422011,0,86,9.716435,5.638355

By the time I got to Warsaw and waited for 6 hours that was expected, then there were delays, then unexpectedly they cancelled the flight at the last moment and informed us that we needed to wait for another 24 hours to fly to Tbilisi. They did provide a hotel. However, I had a family waiting for me for a celebration and I needed to get to Tbilisi as soon as possible. So, I arranged an arduous fight back to Paris, then to Tbilisi that saved more time. My overall flight lasted 37 hours and included lots of schlepping, but I have to mention the detour through Air France that provided light and amazing service through this ordeal. The flight to Paris included this delightful female (unfortunately I didn¡¯t get her name) flight attendant that made things so pleasant. From Paris to Tblisi, on the last exhausting leg, I encountered a flight attendant named Patrick, who made my day pleasant. I can not undermine how he changed my horrific flight experience to quite pleasant. He was authentic, didn¡¯t try too hard. light attendants have a difficult job of dealing with stressed public.

Our flight back on the A380 was significantly less enjoyable. Boarding was reasonably efficient, but I was again the victim of additional security checks at the gate (Happened my last trip in Taiwan as well) which meant I didn't get to board with my friend, and was among the last people on the aircraft. Luckily I didn't have any issues finding overhead space once finally onboard. Once on the plane I was shocked at how dated and worn everything appeared. Seat covers were ill fitting and faded, cabin lighting was dull, the IFE system was among the oldest and in quite poor condition, the remote was filthy, and the bathroom was something Air France should be ashamed of. I can only imagine that since they're already looking to retire half their fleet of 10 A380's they're avoiding putting absolutely any money into them. I've included photos of the more glaring discrepancies. The first meal service occured in the strangest and most haphazard manner I've ever experienced. Seated in row 46 there were about 5 rows behind and two rows ahead in our section. They began serving the rows at the back first, but then stopped, skipped the front three including my own row, then moved on to the next section of seating. After starting at the front t of that section they worked their way backwards until our row was the very last served. This meant room temperature food, and a wait of over an hour all while enjoying the aroma of food in the cabin directly behind us. In addition, the cabin crew disappeared completely for about 6 hours in the middle of the flight. At some point some snacks were placed in the galley area but we were never notified or served. I just happened to see someone seated ahead of me return with ice cream and was lucky to be in an aisle seat where I could grab one myself. The sole redeeming quality was the low cost of the flight, $360 RT, but the poor quality of the A380 cabin and crew means I would never recommend it.

The flight is a connecting flight through Paris, but you have to take a bus to from orly to Charles de Gaulle which.

I couldn't check in and select seats online before the departure, so I only found out that our given and family names got back front in the system the night before our departure. This eventually caused serious loss, inconvenience and panic for us. My complaints to Air France are based on Very inefficient and bad communication service. My friend (whose first language is English) called Air France to address this issue many times on the night before our departure, our call was always transferred to the Air France office in the Philippines. The staff there had limited English, couldn't understand my friend much and it was also very difficult for my friend to understand them. He called more than 10 times, and only figured out the names cannot be changed but we are still not sure the reason. Air France and China Eastern tried to blame each other rather than helping us out. The day for our departure, we went to the airport to talk with the China Eastern. The staff there said names back front happens every day, the airlines can change them for us but it has to be Air France. We called Air France on site a few times with China Eastern staff together, we got the same answer, the names cant be changed because our flights were operated by China Eastern! China Eastern airport staff didn't let us board as they insisted that Air France has to change our names. As a result, we were stuck and had to see our flights leave in front of us, which was one of the most frustrating experience in my life.  We eventually went home, called Air France office many times to negotiate. At last, they said the only way they could offer was to make our tickets as a voucher of 3200 AUD, we had to still book Air France to use the voucher. Being desperate, we booked another Air France tickets, the cheapest one is 6600 AUD for two people, which meant we had to pay the same amount of money again to catch the plane that night. Also, our planned trip was greatly disturbed as these cheap tickets meant we had to come back Australia 2 days later, which caused my visa issue (one day overstay in Austria), two days work, and extra two days hotel and food cost.

Transiting through CDG is not the best, but worked out fine. Flight from CDG to Nairobi was a 7 hours and 30 minutes red-eye flight, very smooth, again with extremely nice crew members.

My first flight was delayed by several hours, causing me to miss my connection at London Heathrow. Upon arriving at the airport after midnight, I was given a hotel voucher. However, the hotel designated by BA rudely denied me check-in, claiming it was fully booked. I had to return to Heathrow at 1 AM and found a different hotel, paying for the taxi out of my own pocket. As a result of these complications, I arrived in S?o Paulo more than 24 hours late. Despite my efforts to assert my rights and seek reimbursement for the taxi, BA's customer service has been extremely poor. Their phone lines are non-functional, emails are only answered automatically, and the appropriate channels for such requests have not been responsive since the first week of March.

Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles.

It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive.

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Keflavik,24-Jun,2,3,1,,,3,2,no,2,"   We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of ?600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight ",negative,-0.739912,0,50,9.569622,7.266827

One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight.

However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them.

We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home.

Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism.

We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown.

I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs.

It's a shame that the British Airways experience is split into a mixture of fantastic ground and cabin crew, and dated products and dreadful after service. Our flight to San Francisco was on an A380, the interior of which was showing it's age. Two of our 3 seats had issues, 1 would not recline, the dividing screen to the next seat would not stay up and the other was temperamental with it's recline and the IFE would not respond to the controls. Crew on board were great but the dated and aging product for which top dollar is charged for should have been upgraded years ago. A shame for such a great aircraft. Coming back from Las Vegas to LGW on an tired 777. We were informed at check in that there was an issue with the seats we had pre-booked and paid for and that we would need to be moved. Seats we were moved to were fine and worked. The original seats had people in them and they appeared fine! Flight was late landing and departing due to weather conditions in Vegas but the aircraft was turned round in a super quick time - which was impressive. Where BA have really let themselves down is the after flight experience. After 3 1/2 months we got an acknowledgement and avios credit for the issues on the flight to SFO. We are still waiting 9 months later for the Avios points we used to pay for the seat selection to be refunded for the Las Vegas to London Gatwick leg of the flight. Despite numerous attempts to contact they haven't got back to us. Our Avios account page through BA won't load our recent transactions and does not list the flights we've taken in the last 12 months!

Length is ok but you have to JUMP over the legs of another passenger when he/she is in sleeping mode. Unbelievable. The system of dividers up and down to reach all seats by crew is absurd and awful. Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That¡¯s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above).

? Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Catania to Gatwick,24-May,2,1,1,,1,3,1,no,4,"  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!",negative,-0.700865,0,50,9.569622,7.266827

Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in.

Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ? hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi.

Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation.

If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you¡±. Although clearly not the purser¡¯s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke.

Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible.

On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone¡¯s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight.

Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I¡¯ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn¡¯t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it¡¯s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door).

In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass.

The aircraft used a remote gate, boarding was not well organised by group status as it should be but I did manage to make my way onto the first bus of 3. On arrival at the aircraft the plane was still being prepared so we had to wait on the bus. After 10 minutes or so everyone was becoming a little irritable. As it turns out the inbound flight had a number of complex wheelchair passengers that needed assistance which was delayed and took a long amount of time when it did arrive. After 35 minutes waiting on the bus we finally boarded the aircraft. The Captain apologised for the delay, no mention from the crew. Seat was standard Euro Traveller, the service was okay but the crew were not particularly engaging. When I tried to order a coffee due to the seatbelt sign being on as a result of some minor turbulence I was told it wouldn't be possible. As the crew member reached two rows behind be the seatbelt sign was turned off but they didn't come back to ask if I would still like a coffee. Overall we arrived into LHR 1 hour late. No tug to move the aircraft in Lisbon and had to wait for the gate in LHR. Disappointing but not the worst flight I have had.",negative,-0.828626,0,50,9.569622,7.266827

Then the bags did not arrive at the baggage belt and after 45 mins waiting had to spend another 30 mins filling in forms etc. Was told the bags are still in Madrid so they know that all the time and did not have the decency to inform us before we waited for them to arrive. 12 hours later no communication from BA. Such a terrible and unnecessary experience and so badly handled by BA. There were many people who had bags that were too big for hand luggage hence the cabins were full before everyone had boarded which is unfair and then not helping by informing us of the fact they did not leave Madrid is a double level of incompetence.,negative,-0.87377,0,50,9.569622,7.266827

Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process.

It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?).

I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins.

First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board.

It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos.

My only criticisms of British Airways Premium Economy is that it feels like they actively try and split families up unless they pay the ?100 each to pre book seats. The majority of drinks are served in plastic not glass. There were no inflight snacks available on an 11 hour flight.

Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin¡¯s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can¡¯t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a ?300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at ?75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question.

The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay.

It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time.

BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost.

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Indianapolis to Mumbai via London Heathrow ,23-Dec,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways, specifically regarding their customer service. After my initial flight leg was canceled, I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes. Realizing the impracticality of this, I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. Shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, I received no assistance. To add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation. Moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India, allegedly contributing to the subpar service.

My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason!! We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible, and the operator totally dismissed it. They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year. Heart surgery recovery takes months and it's highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year, meaning he would lose his ticket and money!

Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I¡¯ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn¡¯t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use.

The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn¡¯t help but stare at one another. It couldn¡¯t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn¡¯t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I¡¯m not sure why they didn¡¯t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray.

Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes.",positive,0.36328,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow.

Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it¡¯ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren¡¯t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers.

The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches.

Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there ¡ª flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses¡ªextra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look.

The flight was Approx 4 and a half hours and the only thing offered was a half cup of water that was poured out and a bite sized banana slice of cake. In fact on my return journey I wasn¡¯t even offered the water! To top it off BA no longer have a media screen from which you can select something to pass the time away. There wasn¡¯t even the obligatory flight journey. The WiFi was poor. I couldn¡¯t even access the shop. However, for a fee so much more was available. This explains BAs record profit of ?1.52bn. So, the question is, what am I paying for? I will now for sure opt for the budget airlines.

The flight was due to depart from terminal 3 but the passengers were bussed for a good 15 minutes to a different part of the airport where the aircraft was on a stand. When boarding the flight the cabin-crew kept a very low profile and this was maintained during the entire flight. The captain made 3 brief announcements during the flight. There was no in-flight entertainment. The seats were clean and comfortable enough for a short flight. The lack of catering was overt. Other than a tiny bottle of water and an inedible ¡°breakfast bar¡± one had to use an online system to order even a drink and of course pay for it too. The passengers next to me could not use the online system as it doe not seem to work and the cabin refused to sell them a coffee because of this fault. Moreover, the USB charge points did not work either. Given the early hour of the flight it is a poor show that there are not even for sale items available from a trolley service. The system BA have in place is not good enough. The flight arrived on-time. The disembarkation was inefficient though and poorly managed and the crew were not to be seen. The crew were wearing the new BA uniform and it seems to reflect a downward trend of the airline. To be candid, there was any difference between this BA service and that of so-called ¡°budget¡± rivals.

Food portions are small and cabin crew is not very helpful especially when it comes to drink requests. The screens in the A380s should be renewed as they are full of scratches and same size as A321s. Especially in longer flights, the entertainment system becomes more important. There is also no welcome package except for pillow and small blanket. I would expect more from BA.

When BA first started flying out of Austin, the food was great. Now, when I arrive at Heathrow, I get real food and take it on the plane with me. I don't know where or who makes BA's food, but it is not eatable. If BA did not have a direct flight from my hometown to London, I would fly with a different airline. When we checked into Heathrow, the line was extremely long and only one person was checking people in. It took nearly an hour to get to the counter.

Having noted the ratings given, frankly, I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service. In a nutshell, BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation. This fact was hammered home on my return leg, which was not in Club Europe. Quite alarmingly, BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its ""Business Class"" seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency. I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen. Short-haul business (Club Europe) is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for lounge/pre-boarding benefits. While cabin crew service is excellent, the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices, etc. places them a million 'air'miles behind competing airlines, such as Qatar, Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality. BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers - really? I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name ""Budget Airways"" The attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer care/appreciation between British Airways and another airline used in this trip.

This time, a 45 min late departure, which seems the norm for BA, and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff. The Club lounge was overcrowded, dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope. How many more cutbacks is BA going to apply before they become truly low cost. As a 35 year veteran user of BA, while people complained of Alex Cruz cutting costs, the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest CEO. One reads the occasional article about BA improving things, but I have yet to see anything substantive. There seem to be few British staff left amongst the cabin crew, so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low-cost - and sadly the staff service has declined year on year. Onboard, the catering remains poor and surprised that Do&Co can produce such rubbish meals when I have sampled their Turkish Airlines equivalent in August that was superb - guessing BA are too tight with their budget.

The funny thing is that I had another business trip in spring 2023, also with BA to Amsterdam. When I arrived to the Airport that time - I was told I don't have a seat. I was put on the next flight in several hours, which should have get me to the business meeting late, but still not too much. A lot of stress.

By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA. A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags. BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation. Many slept in a bus stop overnight.

When we headed to our connection flight, we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed. This was twenty minutes prior to departure time. They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked. Given the busy weekend of travel, we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed. We then waited 3 hours for our luggage, and then took a cab to London's City Airport. The cab fare was roughly $500. When I filed a claim with British Airways, they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare. This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight. The person who rebooked us, told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departure. I will never fly this awful airline again.

In addition I had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when I excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who weren¡¯t being served. Then we got to Heathrow and the real fun began. We had a 4 hour delay. They gave us about 5 different excuses for the delay. I had a few employees walk away while I was asking them questions. They were very rude. At one point there were no employees left. And from the announcements it seems virtually every BA flight was delayed. And there were no weather issues. There was no place to comfortably store items in business class. I¡¯ve never experienced that before. Not even a cup holder for my bottle of water. The seat controls didn¡¯t work well. You had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything. The power outlet didn¡¯t work. There was no internet the entire flight. The overhead luggage bin was too heavy.

In fact everyone refused to help us. It was Saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go home. Anyone with a connecting flight couldn't rebook on the application because the app wouldn't disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us. They gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the app. Finally I got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next day.

I don't have the money to pay for this but after a 10 hour flight, 8 hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from British Airways would help us I took the room. Of course I claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything since so I have no idea when or how much I'll be reimbursed, even though I'm not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference. It's financially difficult for me right now because the money I had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course it's impossible to reach them by phone.

We were three hours early for the flight and had valid passports. After many tries we finally reached British Airways by phone, but we were told to call Expedia which had booked the flights. Expedia confirmed that we had been bumped from the flight, with no explanation as to why. Expedia then began a long process of finding alternative flights. Over the next 24 hours we had numerous calls with both Expedia and British Airways. Incredibly, the next available flights were 9 days later on April 3. This was almost unbelievable, but after many many tries it was the best we could do. Even though these were Business Class tickets. Part of the problem was that apparently rules did not allow any changes to routing for any segment of the flight. This nine day delay was a major problem for us. I had to miss work and my daughter was missing school. Further, we received no compensation from British Airways, no penalty fee, and not any reimbursement of our expenses for staying the nine extra days. After our return I began the British Airways online complaint process, and submitted all supporting documents. I received an email reply and a case reference number. And then nothing. I sent numerous follow up emails, and received no replies. It is now months later, and still I have not heard from British Airways.

I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport, and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation, when I was already at the airport. The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers. The ground staff¡¯s attitude was that they are merely third party agents, not BA employees, and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all, telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help. They couldn¡¯t even provide us a phone number, telling us to look it up on ba.com ! So BA abandoned its passengers. They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled, meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day (although other airlines were still operating the route- but BA refused to rebook us on them). The reason given for both cancellations was ¡°technical reasons¡±. No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation, nor any information on help regarding food/ accommodation help etc. Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem, not theirs. I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later, which wasn¡¯t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night. I rang BA¡¯s call centre and again, they showed a high degree of callousness. 95% of the half-hour call was spent with me waiting on hold, with the phone just cutting off after half an hour, and no meaningful information given to me by that point. There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut (and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport), even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details. They just don¡¯t care. In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away , waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted.

How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy. Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised. The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position. There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping . The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of. The whole business class set up is a sick joke. Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off.

Their customer service was not only ineffective but also astonishingly callous. Their response was, in essence, ""It's your fault for trusting us with your belongings.""

On arrival in Rome, my wife was forced to walk to the check-in desk because our reservation for wheelchair assist from the plane was never transferred by BA. She was told by the cabin crew that there was no reservation for her transport. Also, our checked baggage (2) failed to make the BA rebooked flight from London to Rome. BA took 9 days to deliver my bag and 12 days to deliver my wife's. I called BA Baggage Claim Services daily. I was frequently cut off after waiting on hold for over an hour. We had Apple Air tags in both bags, and sent pictures showing their exact location to BA Baggage Claim several times. After 5 days, BA stated that they found my wife's bag, but needed to verify ownership! Both bags as described had bright pink 4¡± easily visible tags and bright pink bows. Taking 9 and 12 days to deliver them is inexcusable. Our return date: July 3 - BA 553, Rome to London. BA 297, London to Chicago. All flights were late. We arrived in Chicago more than 3 hours late, missing our ground transportation to our home in Michigan (3 hours away). We had to find a hotel and stay overnight near Chicago. On July 12 we filed our expenses for replacement of lost clothing and toiletries, also for food purchased at Heathrow due to the flight delay and overnight hotel charges in Chicago. After 2 weeks, I went online asking for some follow-up on both cases, but have had no response at all from BA. We are retirees on fixed income, and cannot fund BA¡¯s errors. I can honestly say that the times I was able to reach a human being, they were all courteous and attempted to help, but appeared at a loss. ",negative,-0.646524,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

We stood around at Gate B45 in Terminal 5 for over an hour, with staff giving very different reasons for the delay, late inbound aircraft etc - but the plane we boarded had been sitting there for more than an hour! After boarding, the captain stated that because they had changed planes there would be no meals served. This is Club Europe, and we received one small packet of crisps throughout the flight. No effort to apologise. We smelt the hot meal for pilots being heated and then saw it being served to them on a Club Europe meal tray. Cabin crew also had warmed pastries ( and were very quick to use air freshener in the front galley!) while customers received zilch. BA sent an email the following morning to say sorry - nothing else. What a complete and utter rip off by an airline that is already cutting back on so many things. I paid a full Business class fare, did not receive any part of the onboard meal service and they expect an email to be sufficient.

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to London Heathrow,23-Aug,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I arrived at the airport about 2.5 hours before takeoff to have more than about time to get checked in, go through security, etc. All that went without any issues. Being that I was relatively early at the gate, I was one of the first passengers there. After some time boarding had opened. First the business class got called up, then families with children and disabled people. A couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people, one by one, by name. Then there was an announcement: they won¡¯t let anyone in anymore. Me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in. The reason, they said, was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered, speaking to a manager, that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked). After the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldn¡¯t be let in anymore. Nothing changed and everyone was sent away. I had a connecting flight later that day that I was going to miss because I was not let on the plane. First I tried to get my luggage back which I didn¡¯t receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnel. Then, just like everyone who was going to fly with the same plane, I wanted to talk to someone from British Airways. Since they don¡¯t have a service center at Frankfurt Airport everyone went to the check-in counters where we received food vouchers but not a single person was either able to rebook my or anyone¡¯s flight nor get anyone refunded. All the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund. I waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today. Trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversation. After the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from the same flight went back to the check-in counter to get a confirmation from them that I will receive a refund. Being that there was a new shift the personell did not know what had happened. When they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault I could not attend the flight. It looked like I had missed it. For everyone standing there with me it was exactly the same. But the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it. Later on we were able to speak to the manager after many phone calls he said they were going to take care of it. We are supposed to get an email at some point in the future. I was not able to get a written confirmation that I will get refunded even after several times asking for it. I already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me. Not only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way. In the end the only option for me to get to my destination would have been to book a last minute flight for a lot of money which I would not know if I ever got it backed.",negative,-0.739102,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

The Business Class check-in desk assistant, was unsympathetic and told us we could not check in our bags for the following day. We found someone else who told us we could check them in 24 hrs prior to departure, so we waited at the airport an further 2 hours and checked them in, after which we went back home. We were not offered a refund, nor told how to claim for the extra expenses incurred (train, change fees for the connecting flight to Zimbabwe, loss of one night stay at a very expensive safari lodge etc), we were not offered anything.

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gibraltar to London Heathrow,23-May,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," Terrible Experience with British Airways. I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase ""abandoned"" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another ?125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn't care. They said there was nothing they could do. I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again.",negative,-0.748137,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

? Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London City Airport to Frankfurt,23-Jul,3,3,,,,1,1,no,1," A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'.

Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience.

The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. The meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your ?100. The only real plus is Champagne. But on my flight, there was none because of ""supply issues"". The cabin attendant (I think his name was Tom) must be one of the best in the business.

They won't treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes. We recently had a trip home planned from MRS to SEA. A mechanical issue meant that we departed late from MRS to LHR where we needed to make a connecting flight. We landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate, but a series of issues and choices by British Airways kept us from boarding our next plane. The crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere 5-10 minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines. Plus, we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed. We were pushed to Virgin Atlantic to figure out how to get us home.

Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home¡­.we were wrong.

After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can¡¯t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta.

When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me ""Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance."" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether.

Don¡¯t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 ¨C When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn¡¯t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that¡¯s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn¡¯t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 ¨C If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again. And if this review helps one person that heeds my advice, then my job is done.",negative,-0.674699,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 mins. Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. The inflight magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times.

After having our flight class reduced from First to Business, then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in First to make up for the disappointment, they then reneged on this. As it was a special anniversary it sucked. Flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats, at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only. Trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats. Unbelievable! The flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable. This meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food. The crew was great but what an earth is going on at BA, they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time.

? Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sydney to London via Singapore,23-May,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways. ",negative,-0.872034,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service. If there are other options available I would choose them over BA these days.",negative,-0.583113,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

When I arrived at LAX one of my bags were missing. There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn¡¯t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn¡¯t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn¡¯t have my bag.

Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid.

Seated in the front cabin (just 3 rows of club) in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner. Come to think of it, I will really miss this old style -once cutting edge- lay-out. There is no better way to fly when you are a couple. We were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle. Still terrible you have to pay for these seats, but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats. Flying BA when the crew is good is amazing. Service was impecable on this flight. Just the right mix of humor, service and attention. Food seemed to be good as well, but hardly touched it. I am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better. On time departure, smooth flight and early arrival at Heathrow. We went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track. Security at LHR has always been terrible, but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without 'secundary' checks. We had a lovely shower at the 'spa', what a fabulous facility. The South Lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster. Who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess! Food on offer was solid and so are the drinks. Our home stretch to Amsterdam was pretty straight forward. Lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent bar-cart service. I love the 'double'-servings of drinks. English tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and I really don't understand BA stuck to it through the years. No-one like the cucumber white bread things, but hey... On time landing in Amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a 20 minute late arrival, why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in Amsterdam? Flying club in BA is still wonderful. I Love it!",positive,0.522233,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

Once this was confirmed, I went to the counter to get my new boarding pass. At the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in 15mins for the hotel. We (me and other fellow travelers) waited for over 45mins, there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions. The transfer hotel was 30 mins away from the airport. When we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30. that was a rush. It appeared more of a Motel than an hotel. The room - was smelling of weed, being a non-smoker this was uncomfortable. Although I wanted to compromise and rest, when I went to wash my face, the tap on the sink came off in my hands, I panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room. After some discussion, they agreed to change it. I went to the alternate room, to my horror, it was occupied. I asked the staff to call a cab, and I left. ",negative,-0.733055,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest. After landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My connection was less than an hour long! The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight.

? Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Dubrovnik,23-Mar,1,3,2,,,5,5,yes,7,"  
Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option. Given 1 point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard.",negative,-0.4676,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

Get to LHR at 12.00, email to say flight cancelled. No one able to help at LHR, said to use the app. Only halfway sensible option was from LCY-AMS at 17.05, so taxi over there as trains from LHR not working (ok, not BA's fault). Get to LCY, showing as cancelled on screen, so check the app and there it is. Rebook again via the app to the 15.30 departure, go to desk to drop bag and was told that I was only on standby for the flight, with no guarantee of a seat, despite the app telling me it was confirmed. The 18.35 to AMS was already overbooked so was moved onto the 19.30 flight to Rotterdam. The 15.30 and 18.35 were both cancelled anyway, as it happened. Eventually took off and the best thing I can say is that it landed intact. Return from AMS-LHR, similar story. Arrive at AMS, screen shows the 21.00 is cancelled. Quickly check app, and confirmed it was. No emails, no texts, nothing. Rebooked via app to the 22.00 departure, so could have been worse. Desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight. Overall, dreadful. They just don't care and hide behind apps and automated call centres.

We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I¡¯d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ¡®computer says no¡¯. If this is the service level for silver members I can¡¯t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn¡¯t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I¡¯d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn¡¯t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn¡¯t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there¡¯s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn¡¯t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. The plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service.

I did not realise that when I specifically searched for flights to Malpensa it offered options to other airports in Milan. When I received my itinerary by email, it was to another airport in Milan. The itinerary email did not provide any means of contact for changes or advise me of the 24 hour cooling off period. As it was the weekend here I was unable to reach their office until Monday when they advised me there was no refund (other than fees) as I had missed the 24 hour cooling off period. Apparently as the ticket was issued in the UK, I needed to contact them.

? Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Madrid,23-Feb,2,1,1,,,1,2,no,1,"  My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that ¡°there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you¡±. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to ¡°go online to rebook your seat¡±. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport ¡°must be wrong¡±. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a ?30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight. BA Cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop.",negative,-0.774139,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew¡¯s professionalism throughout.

There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking.

Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal? Snack was decent for the adults, bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it.  Very very poor. Mix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 hours, landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BA in my opinion, is terrible.

Get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats. Despite being not very old, the A380 looked tired inside. Broken side stowage, a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react IFE. The food was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey, 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes. Poor in taste and quality. Mousse desert was great though. Slight issue during the snack meal. Ordered a childs option which was marked as such. Regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same. Asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box. Staff were ok. Couple decent but mostly just ok. Overall, BA just seems a tad cheap these days. Great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended. Just seemed a bit dull and like BA are just an average airline.

? Trip Verified ,"A320, A380",Family Leisure,Business Class,Vienna to Los Angeles via London Heathrow,23-Jan,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height.

My attendant saved me from crying. I don¡¯t know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class, in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the person¡¯s legs sitting in the aisle seat.

IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. Upgrade was worth it at ?200 maybe ?300 (its a long flight) but their offers of ?2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing. Score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10.

We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn¡¯t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won¡¯t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other ¡°arrangements¡± will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN ¡ª LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves.

There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening.

Initially my flight was delayed in Denver by 3 hours. As such I knew I would miss my connection in Warsaw. The Denver to Heathrow flight was terrible. The plane was dirty, I was in economy, I usually fly business or Premium Economy but on this flight there was no availability. The plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good. My food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable. When i arrived in Heathrow it was a complete circus. Passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections. Not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections. After waiting in line for an hour I was finally rebooked on another BA flight to Warsaw. This plane was the smallest 3x3 plane I have seen. Packed in like sardines. My bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to Miami. BA has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in Miami at some point and I can retrieve it from there. I mean the bag is sitting in Heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to Warsaw yet BA in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to Warsaw before I leave for Miami the next day.

I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me.

The meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time. On lading, we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good!

These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it¡¯s just become an experience to be endured. BA¡¯s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA¡¯s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn¡¯t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. Altogether, I would say good things if there were any - but it¡¯s hard to think of anything I could recommend BA for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making European journeys.",negative,-0.521819,1,48,9.308374,5.777652

I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid ?150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a ?50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a ?50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken.

I got access to the IGA Lounge which was nice, but not as nice has the Turkish Airlines Lounge. On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation.",negative,-0.549281,1,48,9.308374,5.777652

The highlight is the Club Suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. Meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once.

Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris.

I liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product. The entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned. The menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable. Prior to COVID one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back. As it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but I doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out. The club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly. It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it. The second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which I thought was quite good.

He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""Your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""Your bag is on its way to baggage claim"").

Couldn't find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I'd get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn't getting a full refund. I didn't cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HK. After another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email.

A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came round after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick, no delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternative.

A group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible (check-in desk, other baggage tracing desks, calling, emails) for two hours to no avail.

Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US, they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security, I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DO&CO was exceptional, I don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-Atlantic flight in economy. It will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station. Overall it was a great flight, helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by BA which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere.

I then chased when it was long overdue. I was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. The refund never came. I try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are available. I have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no response.

As Qantas fly to Heathrow, British Airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on BA from Heathrow to Glasgow. We booked this flight in October however 2 days before we were due to leave, we received an email from British Airways, advising that our flight from Heathrow to Glasgow has been cancelled. To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways. They also sent the email on Good Friday so even when I did eventually find a contact number, their office was closed.

Food can best be described as wholesome, but not meeting quality levels of Air France, Swiss or Lufthansa short haul business class meals. Menu is still missing, and like many other aspects of the experience, BA cut a lot during Covid and have not reintroduced. I wouldn't mind, but on European trips in 2022, BA are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019, and the overall value for money is now very poor. The WiFi did not work from start to finish of the flight. Crew said it had worked on the way out and the Captain had contacted London to get it fixed on the return. BA is becoming more and more shambolic, blaming far too much on Covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings.

Not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on (front and then back) left me gobsmacked. As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris.

We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the ""Points game"" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. In summary would I ever fly with BA again? No, not if I had half a chance of going with another airline.

After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin.

We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour.

However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined.

The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. Apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule.

Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn¡¯t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn¡¯t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband¡¯s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I¡¯d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn¡¯t want to. The flight itself was fine, on time.

Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it¡¯s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canap¨¦ of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we¡¯re in and out of that as well.

I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket.

They ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin (it¡¯s not a large cabin), ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits, one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen.

Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting.

The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets.

Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms.

While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a ?12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for ?12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday.

We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards.

I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangalore to Detroit via London,22-Jan,4,2,1,3,,1,1,no,1,"  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!",negative,-0.762081,1,48,9.308374,5.777652

Even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining they¡¯d miss their flights. Terrible efficiency at the check-in counters. At times, only one member of staff is processing people whilst other BA staff stood around on their phones or having a chat. One member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in. The interior of the plane was generally filthy, crumbs, bits of food, stains, marks all around the seating area. They give you a single wet wipe which I used to think was for your hands but now I see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area. There are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally. On this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasn¡¯t pulling his weight. Very poor.

Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off.

Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again.

These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time.

The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed.

Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ¡®chic¡¯ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It¡¯s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback.

Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all.

I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight.

The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers.

Passing security was fine and Iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food. Boarding was done by a 15 meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate. Not sure why. The plane was a very new A321 neo, with 14 rows of club seating. The seat was ok for a 4 hour flight, but anything longer and I would expect club Europe to have more leg room than the couple of inch¡¯s between my knee and the seat in front. Food and drink where very good, served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers. Good selection of wine to go with a above average salad.

We did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks service. However, on the inbound BA had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliers. Did not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking. Just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes. Back to the flights: both in a new, or nearly near A320, both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect. Not a good check in experience at Tenerife South - just tacked onto the end of a large Tui check in queue.

The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80¡¯s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it¡¯s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can¡¯t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they¡¯re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I¡¯ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I¡¯ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I¡¯ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my ?2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won¡¯t extend the voucher! I¡¯m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I¡¯m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I¡¯ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! Roll on the inevitable BA administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the Worlds Favourite Airline but now the most ridiculed.

Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Mykonos to New York via London,21-Aug,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I think British Airways needs to be much clearer about what their Covid-19 ""travel flexibility"" really means, because it doesn't pass the common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business class ticket from New York to-and-from Mykonos through London. I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says ""therefore we can't answer your call; try again."" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I've now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. They have offered that if I send them a Greek doctor's note saying that I was sick, then they'll give me a voucher for a future flight from Mykonos to New York.

Because of this delay, I and other passengers lost the connecting flight to Tirana. I was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival. When I booked this flight, one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour. Turning it into an 8 hour layover I think is unacceptable and very poor customer service. It shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for.

British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies). BA damaged our Samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online.

I recently had to arrange to have surgery in Budapest and naturally wanted to fly BA. So I booked my flights from BHD to BUD via LHR online on their site. Once booked I informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrived. I would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not¡­ *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. I had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin English. Anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. So I took the earlier flight but this meant I had to fly into London the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. So operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Needless to say I was furious. I complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. Great excuse, only having looked at BUD arrivals info, Ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. So BA¡¯s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. Epilogue: I got refunded most of my money from the flights I booked with BA, although they refused to refund my BHD - LHR flights because who knows? I also lost the money I had spent on a hotel and half of the money I had spent on booking airport transfers. Given the cavalier attitude BA seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that I lost a not inconsiderable sum of money, I¡¯ve decided to avoid BA from now on.",negative,-0.772884,1,47,8.215818,-7.478735

Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the ?5,727 that BA charges for this route.

Not Verified ,Boeing 787-9,Business,First Class,Mexico City to London Heathrow,21-Jan,2,5,1,2,1,3,3,no,4,"  I was travelling back from Mexico City on a business trip. Fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment, which the staff do an admirable job with - but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of BA First at the moment. Firstly - no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2. There's a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details. Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. Not good enough for an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps. The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. The seat would not easily convert to a bed. It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. Again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. All in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service. BA isn't offering it at the moment. If it is essential that you have to fly really don't bother with first unless you have to - or go to another airline. The company just don't care.",negative,-0.48697,1,47,8.215818,-7.478735

My return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either - just hoping for a little more personal space next time! Also wi-fi did not work. I also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time, brought in for the pandemic I'm sure but I hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant.

But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn¡¯t get home. I¡¯ve also tried to fly through Antalya, but the same situation occurred. On my third try, I came to Heathrow and tried to fly away to Cairo. I was declined by another company. Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I¡¯m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I want to mention this). The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn¡¯t do it, as my results didn¡¯t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I¡¯ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I¡¯ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn¡¯t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can¡¯t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don¡¯t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven¡¯t met them. I don¡¯t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! For some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. However, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise.

Crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end. When leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing. On way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged. A guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight. He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything.  Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn¡¯t see them.

I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled. Overall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service I received.",positive,0.65006,1,46,8.280711,-8.263848

Although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight, other features didn¡¯t let me down either. Efficient business class check in at Warsaw, cosy executive lounge Preludium with attentive and helpful staff, well organised boarding (although no priority for Club Europe because of Corona). The aircraft was very fresh and clean. Seats were comfortable with enough legroom, adjustable headrests and power ports. The on board service is different than before Corona times but it¡¯s still very good. Tasty lunch box from DO&CO with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse. The choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality Champagne from Nicolas Feuillatte. All in all a perfect flight experience with British Airways.

The truth is that BA at LAX rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however AF refused to accept me and my baggage unless I paid them a surcharge. So, BA then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into Paris and misconnect and have to overnight there.

A number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack (small bag of crisps and 250ml of water).  It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. Also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck.

The first ticket I booked with them was via Hong Kong. After booking, HK closed it's borders so I could no longer get this flight. I rang up BA who advised that the HK flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldn't yet book me onto a new flight yet. The customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight BA would be putting me on as a replacement. 11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone call. I tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! I decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and I didn't want to end up stuck in Australia. I had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt I had no other choice. When I got back home I raised this with BA. They told me that I was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! I'd never even heard that term before. He simply said BA would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight, he didn't say I had to do anything. So now because I was given the incorrect advice, I am out of pocket by a considerable amount. I raised it with the BA complaints team that I had been advised incorrectly and if I had been told I needed to do an involuntary change myself I would have done so. They were extremely unhelpful and just said that they don't know why I was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it. When I said that wasn't good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if I wanted but they were not prepared to do anything.

The boarding procedure was very well organised (no chaos) with 5 groups boarding sequentially.

I stopped flying BA for 10 years because the head office is so poor - the staff on the ground are good but BA as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed: e.g. over securing client's data, telling passengers what is going on, running a decent frequent flier programme, design of the business cabin (stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo!) and so on.

British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. I guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policy.

Thankfully, the upper deck of the A380 was more civilised, with an efficient, if slightly distant, cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by 2 hours after takeoff, allowing plenty of time for sleep. Food was mediocre and I've given up expecting anything more from BA's business class product. The White Company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement, and breakfast has become rather perfunctory, with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant. Arrival at a chilly LHR was ahead of schedule and we were curbside 30 minutes after landing. Reliability is currently BA's strongest card.",negative,-0.472887,1,46,8.280711,-8.263848
? Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200,Business,Business Class,Las Vegas to Gatwick,20-Jan,2,2,2,4,,4,1,no,3,"  Las Vegas to Gatwick. A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast, friendly and efficient. The lounge was something from the dark ages, all 1970's wooden panels.",negative,-0.580732,1,46,8.280711,-8.263848

Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. But I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European airlines such as Lufthansa and streets ahead of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel vouchers just said ¡®Holiday Inn¡¯. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. Next, the replacement flights. The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the full website on a PC showed my replacement flights. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. On calling BA they wouldn¡¯t talk to me because I ¡®failed¡¯ security- I didn¡¯t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company¡¯s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on this? When I called they had no explanation and only agreed to ¡®exceptionally¡¯ change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes well, BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. But old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong.

I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. Apparently things have improved somewhat since, so I decided to give them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. On the plus side: I flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". Pilots were very good and informative, as always with BA. Quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. Cathay Pacific's is far superior. The two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy fare. It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. If I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I'd fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! This just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering on short-haul. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant.

The food in Euro Traveller is unfortunately no longer free, however being in BA's Executive Club you can pay for the food & drinks with avios, which is very convenient.

Fantastic flight. Travelled solo from London Gatwick to Glasgow in British Airway¡¯s Club Europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service. I arrived at Gatwick around 2 hours prior to departure. All BA Club World passengers are entitled to fast track security at Gatwick. This was quick and the staff were pleasant enough. The lounge at Gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey. Boarding was quick and the flight departed on-time and landed 10 minutes early, the crew were very attentive and friendly. The in-flight meal was delicious (I had smoked Salmon served with curried rice). Overall a really lovely flying experience. Had there been ever-so-slightly more leg room and in-flight entertainment I¡¯d have given this flight 10/10!

I was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight, because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy. Business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers, there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class, and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat, to three seats behind me. . The seats were the same seats you have in economy, the difference being that the middle seat is empty, thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats.  I encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that I had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. You are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. Flight left on time and landed early. British Airways have in my opinion the  best inflight W-Fi service. For 10 pounds you get unlimited, very high speed wi-fi where you can stream YouTube videos.

Non-alcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time.

The flight to London didn¡¯t have the best service, most toilets were out of service. The beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class I¡¯ve flown.

Let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall. Cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent. Aside from that, I now understand why BA has such a horrendous and well-deserved reputation. Never again.",negative,-0.761967,0,45,9.494767,7.561122
? Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Gatwick to Bridgetown,19-Dec,3,2,3,3,,3,2,no,3,"  The first thing is the shortage of staff. The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn't get any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. I then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing. ",negative,-0.72438,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

Club World from London to Bangkok on 17 Nov 2019, seats 15C and 15D. It was a Boeing 777, with a 2-4-2 seat configuration in the business cabin, which gives the cabin a crowded impression. The seats are comfortable, with a flat bed (+mattress!), good selection of entertainment, although a rather small screen. The food menu offers different choices of starters, main course and desserts. The food was disappointing, I had smoked salmon as a starter, and British Beef as main course. My soup was cold, mybeef was overcooked) and quantity was economy class-like. The service is very friendly, but not personal. I¡¯m used to be adressed by my name when I fly business class.  While serving the meals, they forget serving me wine. The amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin. After dinner I went to sleep. The seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. The space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bed. Once the bed is made, there is no place to put  personal stuff. I had a real good night of sleep though. If your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet. The toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enough. When I woke up, breakfast service was running.  The breakfast is good.  Yoghurt, pastries, fresh fruit, and a full English Breakfast. Overall, British Airways World Club is a rather standard Business Class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience.  If BA wants to compete, they have a long way to go.

The new boarding by groups meant snaking queues, but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily. The Club World were still the same, much maligned seats with the small, unresponsive IFE screens and limited selection of films. The dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat. Trolleys may lack glamour, but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight.

I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone¡¯s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only.

While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well.

If you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you, you will need to do some major maneuvering. Touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable. I flew on a 747 both ways. They no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm. I had to ask them to turn up the a/c both ways. I was literally sweating.

Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ¡®Geneva convention¡¯ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update!

I had tried to reserve seats on BA website twice and was not able to do so. Then I tried to call BA twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option. When we arrived today in London from Toronto at the connections desk, seven hours before our flight, we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy. BA¡¯s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats, we were at the bottom of the list for business class, and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us, but we would still be welcome in the lounge, (as if this was a bonus). Then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge, since they could not print our boarding passes (due to the down grade). It took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk. We asked to speak to a manager, but at each of our four interactions with BA staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us, giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could. At one point I got visibly frustrated after the BA staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary, which it definitely was not! After two and a half hours BA customer service managers came to speak with us. They were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective. If British Airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight, I will not be booking flights on BA again.",negative,-0.726613,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

As it was, weather in the UK plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes. Once airborne in a refitted A320 (complete with a nice fresh leather smell!), cabin crew in CE were friendly and efficient, and the food (including a cod dish) was quite reasonable. It was interesting to note that the refit hadn't extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear. A big plus on the flight - and a first for me - was WiFi, which actually worked and was quite fast - although at a cost of ?4.99 for an hour's use. I thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers, but evidently not. Landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights. However, BA had laid on a separate bus for CE passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later. So, not too bad, all in all.",negative,-0.481315,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault.",negative,-0.52206,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

I was supposed to fly with American Airlines from the USA to Dublin, but I had a connecting flight from my origin city to Chicago. Unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from Chicago to Dublin. I was put on a flight to London instead, which I had to run for when I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. I then flew with British Airways from London to Dublin. I was told to file a lost baggage claim with BA, which I did. I was told that the bag would be transferred from American to BA when it arrived in Dublin. Using American¡¯s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after I did around noon on Saturday. I am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. BA¡¯s customer service is terrible. If someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I am going to lose it! My bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city I¡¯m in for more than a day and I can¡¯t get it. Talk about serious frustration. I don¡¯t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. And even though their baggage claim desk was closed when I called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. Unfortunately she couldn¡¯t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who I could call and when to call them the next morning. I did not receive that level of service from BA. I even asked if they could call the airport and was told, ¡°we are not authorized to call airports.¡± Why in the world wouldn¡¯t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? I am not thrilled with either airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help me. This has ruined the first three days of a trip that I planned for two years. If you do check a bag and it¡¯s lost or delayed, don¡¯t expect any help if you flew with BA. And here¡¯s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don¡¯t live in, don¡¯t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. Dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. You will get a lot more information and assistance that way. ",negative,-0.795633,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

The latter I took one bite and couldn't continue. I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course). The service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available.

British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight.

They then downgraded my seat and put me on the plane. They then lost my luggage for 15 days. These things happen but customer service was impossible to use. When you call, you almost always get a message that says they are busy and the phone automatically hangs up. If you send in a request for help via the website you will get only a robo generated message that they will get back to you. They do not.

? Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London ,19-Aug,3,2,,,,1,2,no,2,"  Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London. The whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it.

Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn¡¯t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I¡¯ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I¡¯m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there¡¯s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I¡¯m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided.

? Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg OR Tambo to Cape Town,19-Jul,4,5,5,5,,5,5,yes,8," Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra ?7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route. For the price paid, I'd be happy to fly them again.",positive,0.564457,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It is now 3-4-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. We sat in a 2, which was more bearable. I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed..... I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible. In summary, it seems a shame that BA have improved some aspects of the experience, but seat comfort has been sacrificed, which is a great pity.",positive,0.358109,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

Check-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn't an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. I knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me. After about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go through security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we're used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as Delta's. The food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the ""tea"" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. Those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got my bag. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5.",negative,-0.330887,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds.

We received no information about its whereabouts until July 1st, and it was only delivered on July 2nd, after numerous failed attempts to contact the delivery company. The system used by Lufthansa to track luggage is utterly useless, providing no updates other than stating the luggage is being searched. The response from Lufthansa was not customer-friendly, showing no acceptance of responsibility and offering no compensation without receipts, which is merely a legal requirement. The fact that such issues occurred on both flights highlights significant problems in the logistics and capabilities of Lufthansa in providing reliable service.

I took my original 14.03. flight on that second booking - due to Lufthansa's incompetence, they owe me compensation for the entire ticket price of the second booking for the same original flight - Lufthansa denied that request multiple times.

You can't clarify things properly with the chatbot, because you write that you are at Munich Airport and the chatbot replies ""Are you at Franjo Tudman Airport?"". Unfortunately, this was also not possible by phone, with the explanation that we had checked in our luggage and therefore could not be rebooked. We had to wait for hours in an incredibly long queue until the counter was able to rebook us and give us a hotel voucher. After hours of waiting, we were told in the terminal that Lufthansa would close the desk at 11pm and we would have to book a hotel room ourselves and stay awake at night waiting for the email from Lufthansa announcing the new flight. They just let hundreds of people down by not working. Pick your own hotel, even though all the hotels in Munich were fully booked. A Lufthansa employee in Munich laughed at us and sarcastically said to us, ""We have nice cozy pillows and blankets, you can sleep here at the airport"". In the end, we were lucky and booked the last room in a nearby hotel via Booking. We paid for the cab (120 to the hotel and back the next day) and the hotel itself. The next day there was another surprise - first our flight was 2 hours late, and then the flight was canceled again, we were not informed about this either by SMS or by email. It was a coincidence that we wanted to check the status in the LH app. We were rebooked on a flight at 10pm. We have no deodorant, no toothbrush, have been traveling in the same clothes for more than 24 hours and the question arises whether this flight will take place at all or will be canceled again. This may mean deja vu - standing in the long queue again and in the end, when they close the counter at 11 pm, you have to worry about where you can sleep, how to get to the hotel and whether there is anything else near the airport, you have to pay for everything yourself of course.

Because I also wanted to take some textiles I had previously purchased I called Lufthansa to ask how much it would be to add a 3rd checked bag to one ticket. I was told over the phone the 3rd bag would be $110. I confirmed this price several times with the phone rep. However when I arrived to the airport in Casablanca from Marrakech where I was actually coming from the ticket counter took all my luggage and proceeded to charge me around $350 for that 3rd piece of luggage. I told them many times I was told $110 for the 3rd piece of luggage, they 100% did not GAF and I was forced to pay what they asked. Mind you I already spent + $1300 for the two tickets, and $220 for the two cats, and $180 for the two extra pieces of luggage I added. I filed a complaint and they tried to gaslight me telling me my luggage was ¡°overweight¡± and this is why they charged ~$250 more (everything was in a different currency). I personally weighed all my luggage multiple times before arriving to the airport AND the airport told me the cost was due to the 3rd piece of luggage. Nothing was ever said related to my luggage being overweight. On top of this I tried to upgrade my tickets to see if that would be the cheapest way to have more luggage, I was told I could upgrade but the amount of checked luggage would be based on the ticket class I originally bought. And, on the first of the two flights my cats were forced to be separated despite me paying to have the two seats together.

But despite my better judgement, my wife made me give them another chance on our TATL flight this month, and oh boy, LH did not disappoint in showing how truly awful they are. In addition to all of the above (which makes it super uncomfortable to get work done on a computer), they enforce an absurd Ryanair-style 18 lbs carry-on size limit coupled with dimension limits that fit toy bags. Despite me explaining that in my reasonably sized standard carryon (which was under 20 lbs) I am carrying bare essentials to keep my special needs 4-year old manageable for a 24-hour trip and that this was the only carryon bag for three paying passengers combined, they made me empty everything into what was essentially one grocery-sized plastic bag: passports, diapers, medications, sleeping needs, children books, toddler food, water, one change of kid clothes ¡ª everything in one jumble. With this Hansel and Gretel type bag of overstuffed chaos I proceeded through several airports and planes courtesy of LH while my essentially empty carryon traveled checked in and the overhead bins were empty as well. The same farce was repeated on the way back, with the added twist that the plane experienced a technical defect that caused a 2.5 hour delay for which they issued us ¡ª after the late flight had boarded ¡ª 10 EUR meal vouchers which wouldn¡¯t have been good for anything anyway since the US bound flight section had only one counter which had quickly run out of food. They also forbade the use of an FAA approved seat belt for my child on all flights, citing German regulations. LH is now strictly back in the banned category for me.

They are much younger than us. Arrive at gate but checkin manager day's she can't let either of us board because I do not have a visa for Vietnam. I point out I have paid Lufthansa to get me to Singapore where I can sort out my issue with my Visa with my daughter who lives in Vietnam and my son who lives in Singapore. Other passengers board as checkin staff refuse to let us board n tell us our luggage has been removed from flight and plane has taken off. They kept our suitcases. We walk back to find Lufthansa Service Desk where staff say we should have been allowed to fly. They book us in to a hotel for the night and book us on board flight to depart evening of 27th March, a day late for our connection to Vietnam. They said as our suitcases had been checked through they would make sure they were on our flight. Every member of Lufthansa staff was rude and arrogant towards us. We asked to check our suitcases were definitely on board at Lufthansa Service Desk before checkin. They were rude and treated our concern about our luggage with distain. We requested an upgrade given the treatment we had received. Checkin manager threatens my husband and myself with not allowing either my husband or myself fly because she says ""we don't have visas"" and there is no way she will give us upgrades.

Reason given: ""Waiting for passengers from a connecting flight"" - Landed in Munich when the connecting flight LH1650 to Bucharest was already boarding - No staff at the gate to expedite transfer to connecting flight - While making my way to the gate got message that I had been re-booked for another flight 6 and a half hours later - Flight LH1650 was therefore not delayed to ""wait for passengers from a connecting flight"" - Lufthansa Start Alliance Service Desk in Munich terminal K was not able to help with re-booking on an earlier direct flight. The only options presented were to take another connecting flight with a short (and risky) layover through Frankfurt or Belgrade. - Lufthansa Start Alliance Service Desk in Munich terminal K was not able to offer a reasonable or informative reason why some flights are delayed to wait for passengers and others are not. The answer they gave was: ""I don't know, this decision isn't made here. Could be any number of reasons."" - Lufthansa Start Alliance Service Desk in Munich terminal K also not able to offer any complimentary service (e.g. access to lounge, ticket to Munich to see the city, some sort of entertainment, or even more basic water or food) for the 6 and a half hours delay that I am forced to be here. - Feedback from does not pick up my Miles and More details even though I am logged in as I complete this form. It does for the bookings but not for the feedback. Consequences: - Anger for being treated differently than the passengers for which my flight was delayed departing out of Zurich - Wasted time: 6 and a half hours in Munich airport - Wasted money in the airport - Stress and frustration of having to re-book all plans for the day. I will have lost 6 and a half hours in which I had other appointments at the destination. - Frustration for not being given any reasonable or informative information or alternative flights at the Lufthansa Star Alliance Service Desk - Suspect the reason why my details are not picked up on the feedback form is because of lack of interest in gathering feedback. - Frustration and anger for having to waste even more time to fill out forms and leave reviews to be heard instead of being treated with empathy by a human at the service desk. - Dissapointment for having been forcefully put through this experience Question I now ask myself: Why do I have a Miles & More membership and will often pay more to book with member airlines? Conclusion: when flying Lufthansa with Star Alliance - Connection of 45 minutes are not enough for a transfer between member airline flights - Flights may or may not wait for passengers from connecting flights. It is unknown how this choice is made. - Passengers will not be treated like a human with empathy but like a number with a ticket in a queue - In case of delayed arrival there will be no effort made to expedite transfer to the connecting flight. - Service desk staff don't have the training/ courtesy/ means to offer adequate information or complimentary services, and lack the basic people skills for customer service: patience, problem-solving, empathy, adaptability. - In case deemed necessary by the system you will be automatically re-booked with no warning, advice, or choice. - Lufthansa with Star Alliance does not equal more reliable travel experience or better service.",negative,-0.780952,0,71,10.475653,7.432484

Firstly, the lack of children's headphones has caused additional inconvenience during the flight, especially for parents who want to provide comfort for their children. Furthermore, the airline's promised gift remained just a promise, which caused disappointment for both us and our children. Secondly, the children's meal was far from ideal. Not only did the quality leave something to be desired, but the selection was also extremely limited. This created additional difficulties for parents trying to accommodate the tastes of their little passengers. Overall, my experience with this airline was anything but pleasant. The insufficient attention to children and their needs greatly spoiled the impression of the flight. I do not recommend this airline to families with children who are looking for a pleasant trip.

Throughout this ordeal, the group was stranded with no Lufthansa staff around to provide assistance and no contacts.  Amidst the chaos, desperate attempts to secure accommodation proved futile as nearby hotels were fully booked. With no alternatives, the stranded passengers resorted to spending the night on uncomfortable airport chairs. Next morning we went to Departure Checkin Counter.

This was not announced or explained by the airline, people were just expected to know they had to go to a separate counter to get a weird little sticker put on their passport. The reason was not given, and when I asked the Lufthansa staff member he got very defensive and shouted BREXIT at me - as though this very unusual process was completely explained by this single word.

In the last announcement, it was said that the app would solve everything, and we could manage our onward journey there. But as you know, the app doesn't work.

A technician and the purser examined the seat and came to a common conclusion: ""The only thing to do is to saw it off."" Since the flight was full, I had no choice but to sit in such a seat for over 8 hours. My question: If safety is so important at Lufthansa and it is always checked whether one is fastened, then why are you allowed to fly in such a seat?

As both flights were late night departures I was mainly interested in sleeping rather than eating. But the food I did have was good and well presented and I enjoyed the cooked breakfasts of scrambled egg and smoked salmon cooked to order.

Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Colombo,23-Dec,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," I recently had an incredibly disheartening experience with Lufthansa, and I feel compelled to share my ordeal to warn fellow travelers about the serious issues I encountered. My journey with this airline was marked by delays, missed connections, baggage mishandling, and subpar service. Flight Delays and Missed Connecting Flight: My scheduled flight was plagued by repeated delays, causing a domino effect that ultimately led to missing my connecting flight. The lack of communication and transparency during these delays left passengers like myself feeling frustrated and stranded. The impact on my travel plans was significant, and the subsequent attempts to reorganize my itinerary were met with unhelpful and indifferent responses from the airline staff. Baggage Woes - Not Once, but Twice: To compound the already distressing situation, my checked suitcases were not loaded onto the flight not once, but twice. The first instance could be considered an unfortunate mistake, but the recurrence of this issue raises serious concerns about the airline's operational reliability. The inconvenience of arriving at my destination without essential belongings is simply unacceptable, and the lack of a proactive solution from the airline further exacerbated the problem. Subpar Service: Throughout the entire journey, the service provided by Lufthansa Airline was nothing short of disappointing. From unhelpful staff during delays to the apparent lack of a well-executed baggage handling system, it became evident that customer satisfaction was not a priority for this airline. The attitude of the staff members was indifferent, bordering on disrespectful, further adding to the negative experience. In conclusion, my experience with Lufthansa Airline was a complete letdown. The accumulation of flight delays, missed connections, baggage mishandling (repeatedly), and poor service has left me with a resolute decision never to use this airline again. I hope this review serves as a cautionary tale for those considering travel with Lufthansa. There are undoubtedly more reliable and customer-focused options available, and I strongly advise against choosing this airline for your travel needs.",negative,-0.815041,0,70,10.475653,7.432484

To be honest, it's quite unfair from Lufthansa's side to provide a service similar to a low-cost carrier but to set prices and to advertise themselves as a premium airline. As for now Lufthansa has learned all the ""tricks"" from the arsenal of an average LCC to limit the options for a passenger and hence to have a possibility to make everything payable, e.g. no included checked luggage (well, that's the only thing I support as many passengers don't need to have and to pay for this option), no free seat selection, a very limited meal service on board (a small bottle of water and one chocolate bar). They even managed to bring a calibrator to the gate and to measure the size of hand luggage and that looked really miserable. What made me especially angry is this ""boarding by groups"" which means if you randomly get a seat that belongs to ""group 5"" you will need to wait up to 40 mins in the queue. The announcements about which group is currently boarding are barely hearable so you have to keep your attention and to wait near the gate for quite a long time. Another unpleasant thing that should be avoided was that both times in Frankfurt the aircraft was positioned in the remote corners of the airfield so we had an ""exciting"" long trip to the plane in a cramped bus. I admit that there could be technical reasons for doing that, but it looks like more ""uh, it's just Warsaw, not Zurich or London, the public flying to this destination is not so demanding so we can provide a mediocre service and nobody will complain"". When I take a LCC flight I can fully accept all these issues because the low price justifies them, but it's not an excuse for Lufthansa. I have never taken the long-haul LH flights and I can believe that the situation is better there, but on European destinations I consider Lufthansa to be not fully competent and I tend not to choose it in the future.",negative,-0.844955,0,71,10.475653,7.432484

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Dubai via Munich,24-Jan,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,no,1," Thanks to Lufthansa 2024 didn¡¯t start particularly well. I¡¯ve had a return trip from Dubai to Amsterdam via Munich with Lufthansa. That was my first time flying LH and I thought they used to have a good reputation. The trip began with the 3hrs delay from Dubai. After arriving to Munich there was no person to connect the bridge to the plane and let people disembark. Since I missed my connection I was rebooked on the last flight available that day. Again, the boarding was delayed because they couldn¡¯t find a crew member. That part still leaves me speechless. Finally our flight departed with people sitting on their bags due to lack of storage compartments. That was more like a scene from a bus in the suburbs, rather than the safe environment up to aviation standards. On the way back from Amsterdam of course the flight was delayed as the inbound flight landed late. I also got to learn that the airline is saving costs on cutting the ground staff. There was 2 check in desks where *priority* passengers could get assistance. The remaining peasants checked in their luggage by themselves and pray for it to actually make it to the plane. After another couple of delays on both of my flights we got welcomed by the crew member who didn¡¯t even bother to pretend like she was there to assist people. I did her job helping people around me to find space for their luggage, while she was standing there and yelling that we need to take it to the front. Her charming personality then continued glowing throughout the flight when she would keep knocking people¡¯s heads with her elbows and pretending she didn¡¯t notice. Kicking passengers personal belongings under the seats with her feet was also very welcoming. This wasn¡¯t even the end of it. The cherry on the cake is that after finally arriving to Dubai I received an email stating that they lost my suitcase. Here¡¯s where I also learn that there¡¯s no customer support team or anyone to follow up with, as of course, that would mean paying people salaries. There¡¯s no phone or email communication from Lufthansa. You do get a wonderful chat bot option which is basically talking to yourself.

How wrong we were! Our whole experience, which is still ongoing, five months later, ruined our holiday of a lifetime. It started before we had even left home for the airport, when I tried to book inflight diabetic meals for my husband. This has never been an issue with other airlines but, although Lufthansa offers eleven choices of meals, these do not include a diabetic option. Even at the airport, their staff couldn¡¯t find the option for us. The stewardess kindly put a note on my husband¡¯s records, asking for the said meal on the return flight but this didn¡¯t happen.  On landing at Windhoek, we found that one of our suitcases had not arrived.  We queued with others to report the missing case and completed the form derived by their QR code. I received an email confirming the loss and promising an update within 24 hours. I am still waiting for it. We now had to go into a city we didn¡¯t know; find a shopping centre, we didn¡¯t know, and then find shops to replace essential items, including my husband¡¯s medication.  During our stay in Namibia, Lufthansa repeatedly changed our return flight times, the details of which were emailed to me and I had to confirm within a certain time frame. No allowance was made for the fact we were in a country with very poor Internet coverage. At times I couldn¡¯t even get reception on my mobile phone. So, when we arrived back in Windhoek, to catch our flight home, I found their email cancelling our seats, as I had missed one of their emails.  On using Lufthansa¡¯s webchat, to rebook our return flights, we were told our flights had been cancelled because of industrial action at London Heathrow. When trying to claim compensation, after our return home, we were told the flight was cancelled: because of bad weather in Windhoek and the plane couldn¡¯t land and when I emailed them that we were already in Windhoek and the weather was fine, we were then told the weather was bad at the airport the plane was flying out of to get to Windhoek. Eventually we received compensation for the so called cancelled flights. Although we could claim for accommodation and meals, no allowance was made for three days lost pay; extra vehicle hire; extra fuel nor extra entry fees ¨C all of which were occurred or forced on us.",negative,-0.765599,0,70,10.475653,7.432484

The design of this business class (including lower deck) works for a couple but for people flying in business, does not make much sense. There are ample of holes if you are seating on the window seats but none for the passenger seating in the aisle seats. The seat was ok, it reclined fully and did it's job.

I have submitted my feedback to Lufthansa, and for this I have received a copy-pasted template response that have denied my request to compensation when I have not made or implied this request any at any point. Lufthansa made it clear that the comfort experience was as-intended by the company. The crux of the issue was lack of upper body ergonomics in the seats - while there was decent legroom provided, there was no way to rest my upper body without disturbing the passengers next to me, no matter how I tried to contort and what sitting poses I would pick. At its root, there is just not enough space between you and the forward seat ahead when it is reclined (which it will be on a long transatlantic flight!), the arm rests were useless, the angles between your body and seats/walls were uncomfortable, and the seating surface was just a bit too short.  Additionally, the in-flight entertainment gets a low rating due to brightness issue compounded by lack of space - if the IFE screen is off, any time you try to move in your seat you will bump against it... at which point the screen comes back on at default brightness. This means it'll shine bright in your face and disturb people around you many-many times over on a dark flight. The default brightness is extremely bright for a dark flight condition when everyone is trying to sleep, and there seemed to be no way to make the IFE remember the brightness level. I did not use IFE for its intended entertainment purpose, so I cannot rate the media contents. The second short flight using A321neo was just OK. It provided the basic level of comfort, but was nothing to write home about.

I was originally booked to fly from London City Airport to Frankfurt on the mid-morning flight but the inbound aircraft could not land due to dense fog at that time and the aircraft was eventually diverted to Gatwick after several go-arounds, so my flight as cancelled at the very last minute (when all passengers were waiting at the gate to board). There appeared to be only 2 Lufthansa ground staff at London City airport managing this flight and the senior member was unfriendly (she was borderline rude to some passengers who were understandably worried about delays leading to missed connections in Frankfurt) but her colleague was much more sympathetic. I bypassed them both in the end by reaching out to Lufthansa using their web chat on my phone internet whilst still at the airport gate, and was rebooked on to a later flight from London Heathrow airport, though the web agent had to wait for the Lufthansa computer system to ¡°officially¡± recognise that my original flight had indeed been cancelled (which took a few minutes). I was then rebooked and checked-in automatically and my new boarding pass emailed to me immediately. I appreciated that I had automatically been allocated an aisle seat on my new flight, as I had paid for an aisle seat for my original flight. So basically the web chat agent had been very helpful. After that I was reliant on the Lufthansa ground staff to walk us (all affected passengers) back to ¡°land-side¡± from ¡°airside¡± of the airport. Luckily I did not have check-in luggage to wait to collect, so I immediately travelled across London (at my own expense) using public transport from City airport to Heathrow airport for the early afternoon flight to Frankfurt. This was a totally full flight due to accommodating others who had missed the City flight like me. Boarding for this flight was by zones, and I saw some people¡¯s cabin luggage (those with carry-on cases) being weighed at the gate itself to check for compliance with the 8kg limit. This flight took off half an hour late (not unusual for any Heathrow flight, of any airline). We received one small bottle of water and chocolates for free. Anything else to eat/drink had to be purchased (card only accepted; not cash). Service was pleasant enough.

If you enjoy stress, frustration, and zero accountability, then, by all means, book your tickets with them. If not, run in the opposite direction! Let's start with the baggage debacle. Yes, Lufthansa lost not one, not two, but FOUR of my bags! They're trying to prove they're the masters of mishandling luggage. And the cherry on top? Their communication was a joke. I felt like I was playing a guessing game with my own belongings. But the real kicker? When I reached out for compensation, they dared to respond with, ""According to our record, the baggage irregularity happened at your home airport. Please understand that we cannot comply with your compensation request under these circumstances."" Seriously? So not only did they lose my bags, but they also refused to take responsibility for their mistake! Now, let's talk about customer service. If you've ever wondered what it's like to deal with unhelpful, indifferent, and unresponsive staff, Lufthansa has you covered. They've taken a crash course in making customers feel like a burden. Oh, and the fun doesn't stop there. Last year, I had the ""pleasure"" of going through the same ordeal with Lufthansa's baggage mishandling. You'd think they'd have learned from their mistakes, but nope, they're consistent in their incompetence. So, if you're into mind-numbing frustration, long waits for your lost bags, and dealing with staff who seem to need to learn what's going on, Lufthansa is the perfect choice for you.

Once arriving it would take 24 hours to be cleared by customs, keep checking the website. I asked twice if someone could phone us, which never happened. The website is absolutely useless. It says ""we are working hard to locate your bag"". Then it says it has been found and a courier would be allocated but there could be delays. We were not at all confident that our bags would get to us before our flight out of Berlin so we changed our delivery address from our hotel in Berlin to our home address.

Now I understood why they asked the question about the departure of our cruise ship. When I spoke to the flight attendant about that, she said it was not their decision, but that it was ""ground operation"" that decided not to wait for the luggage so they don't miss the flight window. Instead they decided to inconvenience over 50 people, including 7 in my family who are going on a cruise without a hair brush, a pair of underwear or an article of clothing. We were on line for over 2 hours at the luggage desk to fill the forms of missing luggage. It was a nightmare trying to function on the cruise or enjoying any activities without any of our belongings. Six days later we received our luggage in Cyprus. The largest airline in Europe should be embarrassed by such callousness of their employees in Munich.

The agent went into my ticketing & said she had to go upstairs to documentation because of a problem with the previous rebooking. Apparently I had been rebooked via Chicago one day & a second booking direct to PHL 3 days later. When she returned, she handed me to another agent. He rebooked me on a direct flight to PHL with EW Discovery but one day later not 2 days later. He gave me a voucher for a different hotel & complicated directions to taking the train there. I said my luggage was at the previous hotel I was sent to yesterday. He said he didn¡¯t know anything about yesterday. He was very rude & condescending. By the time I was finished with these 2 people, I had missed my shuttle which meant I could not repack my luggage & checkout by noon. I called the hotel & had no choice but to book another night there which I had to pay for out of pocket.  When my rebooking confirmations came through, I received 2 for check-in: One for the next day, the other for the following day, same flights. I checked in to the flight for the following day. The plane did take off the next day, & I was on it. But EW Discovery economy was the tightest seating I have ever been in.  Needless to say, had I known I¡¯d be booked in a sardine can on a partner airline I never heard of for $2200, I would never have booked Lufthansa.

The plane left Toulouse over an hour late, which made us miss the flight from Munich to Montreal. We had to wait 4h in line to get the tickets for the hotel/cab + plane tickets for the next available flight (24h later) to Montreal. The next day we got into the plane, the plane was nasty. I tried putting my bottle of water in the compartment in front of my seat and as I reached to put it I touched used, humid Kleenex from the previous passengers. I was about to take a picture of it when the stewardess saw me and changed our seats. The new seats we¡¯re as nasty as the previous one, coffee stains on the table, visible old journals in the compartment, hairs on the other table, etc. That was at the time when Airlines companies were supposed to clean the planes very well in between flights (for obvious COVID reasons), we we¡¯re also still required to wear a mask at all times. Two days after my arrival, I wrote a complaint and asked for the legal compensation for the missed flight (over 24h forced stay in Munich) and I also complained about the dirty plane, asking for a supervisor to call me. I did not receive and calls, only a weird email asking me for my banking information, which I replied to saying I wasn¡¯t comfortable giving this information that way. It took 5 months (November 2022) before I received another email stating that it was a safe way to give my information through the website. I did send my banking information through the website shortly after that, reiterating that I also wanted to receive a call from a supervisor. I didn¡¯t receive any calls nor any compensation whatsoever. I tried contacting the customer service department a couple of times, they would either hang up on me or make me wait for hours until the line would magically cut.

I filled the complaint, still wrote to them that I was willing to settle it in a friendly way but they still refuse to call me.

? Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Bangalore via Frankfurt,22-Dec,2,3,2,4,3,4,3,no,5," I flew Lufthansa three times last year (twice to India and once to Japan). The India flights were, rather surprisingly, alright, and the Japan one less so. But my problem is not with the flights themselves, but rather with Lufthansa's frequent flyer programme ('miles & more'), which is simply atrocious. First of all, there is no possibility anywhere of interacting with a human being. For some reason, the flight mileage is seemingly arbitrary. Whereas my daughter and I flew together, she got no mileage for two of her four flights and I got nothing for one (a different) sector. How do you fix this? Well, you go to their website and scan in your boarding pass and submit the request. You get a cryptic (by that I mean idiotic) ""reply"" but you cannot reply to that and ask for a clarification! All you can do is to redo the same thing you just did. Secondly, I just tried looking to see how much credit I could get with my miles towards a ticket for my kids. How do you do this? Well, you login to the miles & more website and ask for a flight on the dates of interest. Back a message saying that unfortunately no tickets are available for the dates requested, but perhaps changing the dates might help, alongside a helpful link back to the previous page, instead of showing you a grill with availability on dates a week before or after. So you go back to the previous page and has it kept your data? Of course not! They clearly do not want you to use your mileage.

Real problem was the luggage. Had to pay 500 euros extra for 2 extra suitcases (OK) but our stroller/baby car went for free. This stroller/baby car consists of 2 parts, the bed and the frame with wheels. The frame with wheels never arrived in Sao Paulo (due to Brazilian law you have to pick up your luggage at the first entry in Brazil). Made a report via the Lufthansa website and then it's waiting but nothing happened. Called the luggage department 3 times and they just tell you to wait. Although they ask about a list of contents, which I already filled in . They gave me an email address to mail to send the pictures to, afterwards you get a nice email confirmation. But the pictures are never added to case! After 5 days still nothing. It looks like the luggage department can't just call Frankfurt and asked if it arrived there, then call Sao Paulo or Amsterdam lost luggage (only 3 calls or 3 computer systems, that shouldn't be that difficult). During the calls they constantly ask you for the list of contents, which I filled in off-course, but you can't upload of picture of the lost item (then it would be found pretty quickly). Yes, I can claim 50% of the value, but strollers in Brazil are different and not as good. They should just find the stroller frame with wheels. If the bed part can arrive, why not the stroller?

I missed a step when I was originally booking online and I ended up booking my seat from Barcelona to Munich and not from Munich to Vancouver. I was willing to pay for my seat.  I didn¡¯t have roaming on my phone so I used my friends phone. I googled how to reach Lufthansa from Spain. I couldn¡¯t call their 1800 customer service number because it didn¡¯t work from Spain. I googled everything from what area codes to use from Spain to call Lufthansa using a Canadian phone. Well let me tell you with all this technology these companies have they don¡¯t make it easy on the customer. It¡¯s not enough we have us do all the work ourselves when booking tickets and checking in, but its hard reaching customer service when you need them. Their online system is not user friendly and when it tells you to contact Lufthansa directly, but they don¡¯t offer you a phone number let alone a number for calling from Spain or other foreign countries even though they have offices in these countries. After I managed to find their number on Google and it said it was Lufthansa¡¯s number I ended up calling the Barcelona Airport. Finally, I did reach Lufthansa¡¯s offices in Madrid. This woman picked it up and she was speaking in Spanish. I asked her if anybody there speaks English because I know no Spanish. As soon as I said that her attitude changed. She kept telling me that she didn¡¯t speak English. I asked if some else there did? She said nobody. I told her all I wanted to do was book my seat, but she kept telling me to call this old number that didn¡¯t exist because I had tried it. The irony was this woman kept speaking to me in full English sentences, but then she would say I don¡¯t speak English? She would say ¡°Sir you have to call this number for help¡± ¡°Sir nobody speaks English here not even my colleagues¡± ¡°Sir we have no manager here to help you¡± I told her that her English was fine & that she was speaking to me in full English sentences.  I was pleading with her to help me.  I got my friend to call her & talk to her in Spanish, and she told my friend that she couldn¡¯t book our seats & to wait till we got to the airport. She told my friend that all the seats were booked. The next morning when we arrived at Barcelona Airport we checked in at the Lufthansa counter.

I had a much better travel experience during my last couple of flights with low-cost airlines than during my last 8 or so Lufthansa flights. There seem to be barely any LH flights that leave and arrive on time. In the last week, I took five LH flights and every single one of them was delayed. At this occasion we were told that the crew arrived late and needed to have a briefing and, in addition there were no baggage handlers available. So, we finally took off 40 mins late. I specifically booked a seat in the first row because I have rather long legs and got my boarding pass only to find out during boarding that LH changed my seat and I was bumped back a few rows. As there was no change pf aircraft, there must have been somebody more ¡°important¡± than I which is not a good feeling. (I would have not even said anything if they put some seniors or people with special needs there but the people they put into my booked seat were some intoxicated rich youngsters.) So much about recognising loyalty which doesn¡¯t seem to have a significant role in Lufthansa¡¯s playbook anymore. Food portions were so small that I thought the airline handed out an appetizer before lunch only to find out later that this was actually the meal. Over the last years the food at LH got worse and worse and the portions are constantly getting smaller. The food was beetroot and some inedible celery salat with some cold meat cuts (no idea what kind of meat). Being German myself, I do know that beetroot and celery is part of the diet in some parts of the country, but I just don¡¯t see why people of cultural backgrounds other the German would eat this. I suppose the food in Business was not worth more than about 3 Euros. There is no free food or drink service in Economy at all, The only thing Lufthansa is giving out for free for all customers is a piece of cheap chocolate and an apple (no joke). So, here¡¯s the ¡°verdict¡±: With Lufthansa it is not worth paying extra for premium seats, at least not on short or medium distance flights. There is no free food or drink service in Exonomy Class Loyalty recognition is non-existent. Food is terrible and comes in ¡°appetiser¡± portions only. I can¡¯t see why anyone would pay extra for no extra service unless one wants a free apple and an appetiser (but for the extra price of the premium ticket, one can buy 20 kilos of apple plus one or two bottles of champagne)",negative,-0.756889,0,70,10.475653,7.432484

I am still paying the price, for my unforgettable mistake of booking flights LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo on March 22, 2023, and LH717 from Tokyo to Frankfurt on April 17, 2023. To start, one of our bags was delayed for more than five (5) days, and the airline's customer service at the Frankfurt Airport was unhelpful in resolving the issue. Despite spending over an hour discussing the problem, we received no information about the status of our bags, and they seemed indifferent to our inconvenience. Thankfully, a service agent who overheard our conversation, and helped us establishing the status of the missing bag. Furthermore, Lufthansa's reimbursement policy for the toiletries and clothing was unclear and unsatisfactory. We were informed after the fact via email that Lufthansa only refunds 100% of the toiletry items and 50% of the clothing, we had to purchase in Frankfurt and at the airport before our departure to Japan. Although we filed the expense reports with corresponding copies of the receipts on April 27th, we have been receiving daily emails stating that they cannot issue reimbursements due to the lack of receipts, which were originally filed. This has been a frustrating experience and has resulted in repeated filings of the same receipts. During our return trip from Tokyo, we were assigned a seat in the lower deck of the business class section, which was broken, making the 11-hour and 40-minute flight extremely uncomfortable. When we brought this to the attention of the head flight attendant, she was apologetic, but did not offer any solution other than the manual manipulation of the seat, every time we needed to change its position. To our surprise, two members of what we believe was an orchestra seated in the upper deck of the business class section with their cellos strapped into chairs next to them. Instead, we had to manually manipulate the seat every time we needed to change positions.

My family and I were so excited to visit Venice for the first time, and booked an April 1 departure flight from Hong Kong though Frankfurt with Lufthansa.  Firstly, they canceled my outbound flight just a few days before without automatically rebooking me on an equivalent flight (incredibly, they just removed the segment from my itinerary), with just a discrete email sent to me. I felt myself lucky that I checked my email a day before going to the airport and realized what had happened. As their on-line rebooking system was completely useless (ie. they had simply removed the cancel flight segment without a trace from my itinerary, and so the on-line system could not even find it to rebook.). After 30 minutes of frustration with their useless chatbot, I called into their customer service line, and then the next 90 minutes of pain really started. I tried both their local HK and German hot lines, with a reasonable wait each time, but each time a few minutes into the call, the line would simply cut off. This happened whenever they put me on hold, and sometimes at other random times also. After trying both mobile and land lines at my end, I realized this was probably Lufthansa's IT system issue which the agents seem obvious to. In the next calls, I had to beg the agent to call me back if the line dropped so that they could complete the rebooking transaction. None did for about 10 tries! The Asia-line call center was particularly horrible, as the agent was incredibly rude and evasive, trying to argue immediately that Lufthansa had no responsibility to handle the case as the original ticket as booked through an on-line agent (I booked through Booking.com, whom I had already call. They indicated the Airline was the only one who could make the booking change). Incredibly the agent spent about 3 minutes tried to find every opportunity to evade instead of just solving the problem, and eventually the line dropped (or perhaps he just hung up on me!). Incredible that Lufthansa hires people like this for customer service.  That night, after nearly 90 minutes of trying, I finally got someone on the German call center who was kind enough to call be back after the system dropped the call. She said she rebooked me on a KLM flight that departed half a day earlier and despite the horrible experience, I thought I was saved! Next day, a Friday, my family (4 of us) rushed to the airport to catch the new flight. We had to pull both of our kids out of school a few hours early, and I left work early as the new flight departed mid-day Friday, instead of the original we booked which was early AM Saturday, just after midnight.

Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Berlin via Frankfurt,22-Jun,2,3,3,,,1,2,no,1,"  If you are ever promised to be reimbursed for expenses when they lose your luggage, don¡¯t ever count on it.  My two kids and I flew to Germany several months ago. When we arrived in Berlin, my suitcase was no where to be found. I stood in line for over an hour. When I finally reached the front, I was told the bags were normally located within a day. They promised they would ¡°do what they could¡± and that I would be reimbursed for any expenses that were incurred. The documents they handed me stated the same. The next day: no bag. I continued to check the website, call and email. No response. The website for lost luggage just stated it was still missing. We left and stopped at several second hand stores to find cheap clothes and other necessities, including a small suitcase and toiletries. I thought I did pretty well and kept the cost under $500.00. EXACTLY ONE WEEK LATER We were in Munich when I received an email notifying me the suitcase was in Berlin. The email had a phone number to call with any questions or concerns. No response to emails. Phone calls bounced through automated systems like a pinball. I selected every option throughout the entire system and never reached a live person. Two weeks later we arrived back in Berlin where we would stay for two more days before flying home. I went to the airport to finally retrieve the luggage. I parked in the temporary lot which allowed for 20 minutes of parking before fees incurred. I went in and, after much hunting, located the area where the lost bags office for Lufthansa. Literally hundreds and hundreds of suitcases, bags, etc. It took 40 minutes to find it. I mentioned paying the fine for the parking. The rep stated: ¡°You can add it to the claim for reimbursement. Just keep the receipt¡±. We returned home and, within a couple weeks, I sent off the claim and receipts, along with copies of the original lost bag documents and emails I had received. After a month I received an email requesting I send the documents for the claim again. I resent the documents with the information. Six weeks later, I received another email requesting my ticket information and address. I sent the information back again with the message about a third time After two more months I received a final email: ¡°Thank you for your feedback We sincerely apologize for the unintentional delay in responding to you.

Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Hamburg,23-May,3,1,1,,,2,2,no,3," Lufthansa allows a standard hand luggage 55cm 8kg plus 1 item (laptop bag, no weight requirement). Entering the plane, there was no space at all to place a hand luggage in the cabin overhead bin. That was because all the passengers had already placed there not only their hand luggage but also their plus 1 items, jackets, etc. I informed a flight attendant about this, she apologetically told me ""I know but now it is difficult to fix this"", an attitude I respected although the problem was not fixed. A bit later, another flight attendant tried to ""help"" me however he was not even able to place my small plus 1 item in the cabin bag. Then, I told him again that there are numerous bags in the overhead bin that should not be placed there and they should be moved underneath the seat so that the 55cm luggage can fit. He just started lying to me about the weight of the hand luggage, claiming that both items should weigh up to 8kg (which is a cheap lie according to the official website of Lufthansa) and everyone has done the same here. That is rudeness at a different level, I've never encountered anything like that because flight attendants are super polite and helpful typically (1st time flying with Lufthansa though, maybe that's the problem here). He also claimed that the laptop bag is typically to be used in the overhead bin and the 55cm underneath the seat, that sounded so ridiculous. All in all, instead of trying to help a customer who apparently has paid so that he is able to travel with a decent sense of comfort (without having to place his feet between a 55cm luggage on the floor while keeping the laptop bag at hand during the entire flight), the flight attendant tried to blame a passenger for his own shortcomings being unable to arrange a correct baggage placement in the aircraft! I have NEVER seen such an attitude by a flight attendant in so many flights I've been present. To the contrary, all flight attendants typically rearrange the luggage and try to solve any problem so that everyone can fly in a decent setting. I will certainly never use Lufthansa again, it was the first and last time I did and I would discourage anyone using this airline that does not care about customer service at all!",negative,-0.784742,0,70,10.475653,7.432484

By this point my children hadn't eaten since midday and it was now 9pm. It then finally arrived at Munich at 2230 and we disembarked at 2300. Told to head to the service desk to see what was next, especially since a lot of people including us had missed their connection flight. The queue was huge and the very helpful help desk closed at 0000 before most people could get any information. A tannoy announcement came over saying they could not provide any hotels, but people could either get a hotel and then claim it back or were welcome to stay at the airport, on the floor, and check on the flights at 0600 the next day. No substantial food was offered. A twix and juice carton was provided to substitute the missed meal. We opted to go for a hotel as we had young children. Unfortunately the taxi queue was also huge! To make things worse it was outside in the snow, and well into the minus numbers. What turned this experience from awlful to utterly ridiculous was that we had barely any warm clothes as our final destination was South Africa in the summer. We had to wait an hour before we could get a taxi. We were not allowed to collect our baggage which we may have been able to add a few more layers, as it had been transferred to the flight tomorrow. Or so the tannoy said. We were unable to confirm this, as previously mentioned, the help desk closed. I checked on the app and it did appear that we were on the same flight the following day. I was unable to reserve seats to ensure we were sat together as the flight was less than 24 hours away, but that was a task for tomorrow. That morning I discovered that I had in fact been kicked off that re-booking. According to the app I had now reached my final destination and so the seats were now vacant and booked by someone else. I attempted to use the app, online portal, the live chat and calling up the help line number, none of these could help and told me I had to go the the service desk in the airport. I then spent from 0945 till 1205 in a queue to speak to one of the 5 people working in the service help centre (I was number 3538 and when I got there it was at 3342) there were 12 desks for attendants to work from, but Lufthansa decided that the queue trailing the length of the airport only justified half filling those positions. Finally I was told that it was a glitch in the system and that there was nothing they could do about it but would book me in for the following day. So me and my family had to spend another day in mid winter with no warm clothing. Luckily the there was no issues with the next flight, except that our laggage was temporarily missplaced. We did manage to recover it and headed out for our holiday thinking that the worse was behind us. This was just the outward journey. The I was informed on 4pm the day before the flight home. It had been cancelled! I spent 4 hours on hold to get in touch with the ever-so-helpful Lufthansa online chat number 372 in queue!

Instead of resorting to this option I decided to call and get rebooked to a United flight from a different city (Newark). I called the number provided in the cancellation of my flight email from Lufthansa, but the person I spoke with was a third-party agent and unfamiliar with their job. I had to give them step by step instructions on how to proceed - and their incompetence totally screwed us up on our return. The night before my flight I could not check in as our return tickets were not being recognized. I spent hours of time with a United customer service agent. The agent eventually booked our seats assignments, but when I reached the airport we could not check in! We then had to go to the counter and the agent there had to fix our tickets as my husband wasn't even listed as a passenger. She told us that this was Lufthansa's fault for not entering proper code data. If we hadn't had seat assignments we would have missed our flight. After flying both Lufthansa and United, I can say United is better. This is shocking to me as previously Lufthansa was far superior but their standards have drastically changed. The food is bad, the entertainment selection is mediocre, and worse the seats are horrible! The only positive is the staff was friendly.

When customers book flights, they are entering an agreement (typically an expensive one) with the airline.

Never mind ¡°unable to provide you with the excellent service you expect¡± - this was well below ¡°does not meet expectations¡±. Our Journey from Hell - STEP 1: We originally were set to leave Dallas to Frankfurt for a connecting flight (both Lufthansa) to Toulouse. For reasons outside of our control/not related to weather, the plane was delayed. We chose to try to make our connecting flight instead of rebooking after speaking to the person at the front desk. We spent the entire 9 hour flight stressed about whether we¡¯d make it in time. STEP 2: Our connecting flight was delayed - pretty on brand and a trend that would continue for the rest of our journey. At first we thought it was our lucky day, we sprinted across the entire first floor of Terminal A and up 5 flights of stairs to get to our terminal. WE MADE IT AS THEY WERE STILL BOARDING! We did everything in our control as the customer to be there, yet alas - as we presented our boarding passes, the attendant realized they had given away our seats to standby passengers that were standing right next to us. He pulled us aside, and as we were waiting for him to check our tickets, they continued to let other passengers board. We were finally told they only had 1 more seat left and moved us to the next flight which was a total of 6 hours later (plot-twist: you guessed it, that one was delayed by an 1.5 as I¡¯m writing - AND COUNTING!) The icing on the cake is that they tried to give us $15 meal vouchers for our trouble, but upon presenting them to a vendor, they had not been loaded. DO WE EVER MAKE IT TO OUR DESTINATION?

Sometimes you have to drive to the nearest airport to rebook your flight, and this in the most expensive fare classes Economy and Business Flex. No apologies ever. Add to this the ridiculously high fares and you have a wannabe premium airline with a sub-par service which is often below the standards of Ryanair, Easyjet, Vueling or other low cost carriers.

The lie flat seats are the worst I've ever experienced in a business class -  they recline all the way, but they're two seats next to each other, and there's no privacy, no storage space. If you're by the window, then the person next to you, when they recline all the way, there is absolutely no way to get out - their legs are too high for you to climb over, so if you need to go to the loo, you have to wake them, get them to sit up so you can get out, then they have to wait for you to come back before they can settle down again. The little bag of goodies contained a couple of tiny tubes of moisturizer - no earplugs, no eye mask . And when we got to Munich for the connection, we had to climb down 6 flights of stairs, onto a bus, be driven out to the plane, climb up another flight of steps. They lost my bag for 4 days, but their website says you can buy essentials up to the value of 1500 pounds sterling - and they'll reimburse you. I spent $83.02 in total, on essentials, I submitted my claim on 1st January - 30 days later - nothing - I contacted them and they said ""we never received your claim, you're now out of the window to make a claim, tough"".  I had all the receipts  and I told them how angry I was. They said as a favor to you, this one time, we will reimburse you. I waited and waited and sent emails.

I very much dislike aisle seats as I detest other passengers or crew brushing past me. On boarding the aircraft I saw that 6A and 6C had been given to a couple travelling together. So I feel that Lufthansa discriminated against me as a solo traveller and gave my seat to others so that they could conveniently sit together, even though they clearly booked and / or chose their seats later than me. There was absolutely no consideration to me or my preferred seat selection. On arrival at Funchal Airport I was also informed that there is no lounge.

We booked our flights based on price more than anything else, so we weren't expecting a great deal. Boarding was straightforward and not delayed. The A340 had a 2-4-2 configuration, and one of the crew had whispered to me ""the flight is empty, once we say boarding completed, grab yourself a row for sleeping""; unfortunately, the couple in front of me decided they would have a row each, so my wife and I had to settle for a pair of seats each. Compared to the Singapore A350, the Lufthansa plane was showing its age, though it was fairly clean and tidy, but the toilets in particular had seen better days. We were served dinner soon after departure, which was a hot meal, there wasn't anything else on offer, and anything between that and breakfast had to be purchased, which I did not expect from a full service carrier. That said, one of the cabin crew pointed this out and suggested I may need more than one beer for the 14 hour flight, so placed 2 spares in my seat pocket. The inflight entertainment system was OK, though the range wasn't as good as others, particularly on the music channels. Breakfast was very odd; it was a very large cheese roll - more like lunch than breakfast, with a thick lump of cheese and no pickle. Flight wise, this was the smoothest trip I have ever been on, and the landing was buttery smooth; it was though a culture shock when the aircraft parked a long distance from the terminal and we disembarked on to a bus - 70 passengers on an A340 all bunged on a single bus!",negative,-0.407086,1,69,10.397269,6.690842

Needed to rebook parents' flights due to my father's medical emergency back in June... called a zillion times, phones constantly disconnecting, three times spoke to a different rep who rebooked for me, three times supposedly booking was confirmed, but then the booking code disappeared from the LH website... I'm beyond appalled!!! What a scam this airline has become!! I kept calling 1800 645 3880, the USA phone number. For weeks, even months, the voice message would say that the lines were busy and to call later. I finally got my call answered in November. I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. I tried the second time. The second rep assisted, I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. Five times in a row! This cannot be normal. At one point, I asked the rep whether they were having issues with phones, and she responded yes, but they are being worked on. But I called on other days, too, and it was the same. I got disconnected every time I got a rep on the phone. Is this a tactic by Lufthansa to keep customers away? Basically you can't get anything solved, since you get disconnected every time!! And I repeat, EVERY TIME!!! Over a span of two weeks, I called the US phone number about 10 times, and got disconnected every time, after I explained to the rep what I needed.

? Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Chicago,22-Dec,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I have been at Frankfurt airport after traveling on an early morning flight out of Amman which left at 340am their time. I have been up for over 36 hours at this point and my flight has been delayed multiple times. It was originally supposed to leave at 1040 am and now we are looking at 600pm. We are going to Chicago, and from there have a flight to Charlotte, NC before driving 3.5 hours home. This is on top of being told we will be provided a ¡°meal¡± but being given only trail mix, some kind of chocolate cookie bar, water and juice. We were also loaded onto shuttle buses that had very few seats, we were packed in like sardines, and taken to the tarmac to board a new flight. We watched them load our luggage while we sat stationary on the tarmac with no explanation. Then they started unloading the luggage back off the plane and we began receiving texts that our flight was delayed again until 4pm them immediately received another text stating it was delayed until 6pm. My partner as significant rheumatological health problems and did not have access to a seat, which is a problem for her, and was in tears from standing stationary on a flat hard surface for so long. There was poor air circulation on the shuttle and the close proximity of everyone packed onto the shuttle quickly made it become suffocatingly hot.  We waited approximately 45 minutes on the shuttle in front of the plane before being told, with zero explanation, that we were being taken back to the gate we had just left.  We were then told that our gate was moved from z54 to B23, which is quiet the hike in the airport. This is on top of sleep deprivation and zero real food. I began researching Lufthansa customer rights and found that we are supposed to be provided with a meal voucher to be used at participating restaurants within the airport and that it is built into the bar code of the boarding pass. When we went to use it, the lady at the restaurant said it was something they honor and use but when she scanned the code, she said it hadn¡¯t been activated by the airline yet. When we came back to the counter to see about having it activated, we were told they couldn¡¯t activate it and a manager had to. It is now 408pm local time.  I understand that delays happen but the overall lack of communication and lack of customer service has been appalling.

I have flown Lufthansa for decades, (because I primarily fly on United, and being the Star Alliance partner, inevitably I would be on Lufthansa in the European portion). This month was the first time I traveled outside of the U.S. since the pandemic. I had heard that Lufthansa has completely fallen off the cliff in terms of service, reliability and even general operational adequacy, but I thought, a short 2 hr flight RT between Frankfurt and Madrid, how bad can that get? Their seats booking system is broken, and while we had paid for premium seats over and over again (and promised previous overcharged payments would be refunded, I don't expect to see that refund), we essentially had no premium seat assignments up to the day of departure. Their ground crew was rude and hostile, (e.g. just did not answer my questions, rolled their eyes and smirked with agents next to them, etc.), and the flight crew basically was not present throughout the flight. No service whatsoever on the flight (no snacks, no drinks, I didn't know this is a discount budget airline?). Mobile boarding pass could not be issued at time of check in, I had to line up at airport, at which point, the agent harassed me by insisting on weighing my carryon (they did not insist on doing that for my husband who is White), and said my carryon was 1 kg over, so I had to check it.

A Lufthansa representative eventually advised the delay due to a ¡®technical¡¯ problem, and that ground staff would at Frankfurt would be on hand to help all passengers with late or missed connecting flights. While waiting for our plane to land in Geneva we were told the replacement plane was smaller than the original intended plane, as such, our hand carry luggage would have to be surrendered upon boarding, This created even more delays. 40 minutes into the flight, the pilot announced that due to bad weather, the flight would be now diverted to Nuremberg. At the Nuremberg tarmac, we were given little information. Hours later we were told we would be bussed to Frankfurt, however we were waiting for a bus to arrive, and also, there were no ground crew to help disembark the luggage. Later, we were told to collect our luggage and wait for the bus. No specific area was designated. Eventually an airport representative came out and advised the bus would be arriving in 10 minutes The bus ride would take approximately 2 and a half hours. During this entire 6-7 hour Geneva to Frankfurt ordeal, passengers were not fed nor given time to use the bathroom. During the bus ride I received emails from Lufthansa advising me they had, without consulting me, rebooked the remainder of my trip home. This rebooking meant an entirely different route, and it would also mean I would arrive back in New Zealand a whole day later than I had intended. At Frankfurt we disembarked at a bus stop.

Our return flight from Scotland was cancelled from FRA to Prg, but everything was so well organized at FRA airport despite covid shortages, everyone queuing was given snacks and a drink, then we were automatically given meal & hotel and taxi vouchers when waiting at a hotel for a new flight the next day. This month (October), I finally received a compensation of 250 per person. (3 persons in total) with excuses for a cancelled flight. Since we traveled in Economy class, we bought awesome fresh ground coffee, a sandwich and Poke bowl, together for 20. All the food and coffee was super fresh, very quality and tasty, just like the quality I prepare myself home. Definitely worth money. I think Lufthansa offers outstanding quality when it comes to meals. Ecology and sustainability in Lufthansa catering are a big  highlight to me compared to other airlines.

Since the booking was made, there have been countless flight and schedule changes requiring us to repeatedly contact customer service to accept changes and/or find alternatives as proposed by the agents and re-book on alternate flights with different airlines, timings, dates, airports etc. Despite the extensive flexibility on our end in terms of these factors, every time we called and confirmed a booking with an agent, we were left to find that the booking had either not been made, changed again, or entirely cancelled. We have evidence documenting the numerous calls lasting over 50 hours in total, as well as all the emails/screenshots of bookings from the website documenting the booking changes, as well as the flight cancellations that were made without our knowledge and were not informed of until checking ourselves. At this time, despite multiple attempts to resolve this issue, the itineraries are missing components of the journey as originally booked ie. the last leg of the trip from DEL - AMD for record locators #1 & 2. The customer service agents have not been able to resolve this and have pretty much said there is nothing they can do in terms of ensuring we have confirmed flights for the entire trip as planned and have left us hanging, without answers, and in a panic as our travel date approaches. I also intend to submit a compensation request as advised by an agent in order to be compensated for the price paid for the flights at the time of booking as well as the additional fare difference to book on ticket now with a different carrier, and making the same request to management if they are unable to resolve our problem internally, by booking us on appropriate Lufthansa/Partner flights as booked and paid for.",negative,-0.837903,1,69,10.397269,6.690842

Schedule changes feel very much the norm in today's travel however, I would have hoped the passenger log for my flight would have been correct. Shortly after take off the lead member of the cabin crew took his time to introduce himself to some of the passengers with some polite chat. At this point it became apparent, despite checking in 12 hrs earlier the passenger log had no idea who I was. Asked if I was someone I wasn't, an accusing ""have you changed seats"" was delivered followed by the non reassuring ""oh, no don't worry"" and a clear tone of 'your not at a high enough loyalty member to warrant my time' was delivered in a closing remark. It should be easy for the cabin crew to tell the truth, so when during the second meal service I was informed that the first option was no longer available I was surprised to see the opposite row still able to order and receive, with the polite question asking if option 1 was actually available my original meal choice was found. I can't help thinking Lufthansa have stripped all customer service out of their operation, several attempts to contact the team before the flight were ignored, the only engagement came when they cancelled a section of the journey and asked me to call them, nice touch that their automatic email pretends they have tried to contact me. A small connection flight cancellation was apparently enough to confuse the booking system and the many people in the call centre.  It took six hours of my time reviewing the Lufthansa schedule and and their ticketing availability to find a route that the 'system' would allow. To rub salt into the wound, at HND I was approached by an agent for Lufthansa and asked if I would like to change flights,  for one of the routes I had been denied and that had always shown availability.

She selected seats in a row that was about halfway between the mid and rear toilet areas. (Around row 40) When we arrived at the departure lounge at Munich there was some sort of loud-speaker bargaining situation going on. The Lufthansa staff clerk was stating that a woman in Business class had her seating booking messed up and as such she was going to be separated from her two kids. The clerk was asking for volunteers to give up their seat in order for the woman and her kids to be together. The suggestion was, that the flight wasn't happening until this seat problem was settled. After some time, a guy volunteered to a round of applause from the rest of the people being held up. When we got on board, I got to the row that was printed on my boarding pass that I had been given when we checked our bags earlier in the day. I hadn't checked if the seat matched my wife's online booking from the previous day. When I got to the row shown on my pass, there was a guy sitting on the aisle in what I thought was mine or my wife's seat. A short argument ensued until the guy pointed out the seat next to the window matched my boarding pass. Some people in seats in front of us turned and said they have messed up all the seats. The seats my wife and I endured for 12 hours were right in front of the toilets with little or no movement of our seats or chance to get out without climbing over the lucky winner of the aisle seat. The seats were in a row that was roughly 20 rows different to the one we'd booked. There was no acknowledgement or apology from staff. We noted that the crew were absent from the end of the aisle to welcome passengers to Singapore. Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Brisbane was the third and last leg of our journey, an approximately 8-hour flight. We had tried to once again book our seats online, but the airline was trying to charge $20 dollars for the privilege. So, we just indicated that we'd prefer aisle seats. We received our boarding pass and we'd been given aisle seats in different rows. My wife in the row that is normally reserved for parents with babies and the row immediately behind. When we arrived on board, of course there was a woman with a <1yo baby breast feeding in the adjoining seat.

I was then rebooked for another flight 6 hours later from Munich to Singapore with a 7 hour layover to Seoul. The reason I booked Lufthansa in the first place was to get the direct flight from Europe. But apparently there was not even one seat available on the direct route the day after. I could have stayed at an airport hotel and Lufthansa could have at least guaranteed me a somewhat comfortable sleep as compensation for their delay, but instead I get to spend the night on my way to Singapore and a day at the airport, already tired from the long extra wait, not even to mention missing my meetings in Seoul that I had planned. When I booked my original ticket I had paid extra for window seats, but as the window seats were already fully booked I got an aisle seat and when I asked if I could at least be upgraded for the inconvenience I was told that it would be on my own expense. As I will be almost 24 hours delayed I thought as it states on the Lufthansa website, that I would get the necessary care during the redirecting, but all I got was a 15 euro voucher (which had to be spent all at once) in one of the airport restaurants. Sadly most meals start at 20 euros so it should rather be called a modest meal contribution instead.

? Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Muscat via Munich,22-Aug,2,2,1,2,,1,2,no,2,"  Not a good experience all round with Lufthansa. I thought it was supposed to be a reputable airline but the service provided to us after we missed our connection in Munich (at the fault of the airline) was extremely poor, and frankly embarrassing for a member of Star Alliance. First, the positives. They automatically booked us on the next flight once our connection had been missed, although this sadly did involve another connection in Frankfurt. Also our baggage did not get lost. So they do get 2/10 for these 2 positives. So, what went wrong? Inconveniently, there was not a single member of Lufthansa staff available at the airport in Munich. Thankfully we had downloaded the Lufthansa app, which seemed to be the only way of accessing the information of the new itinerary. Customers who did not have the app really struggled to find the information as there was no email or SMS communication. EU passenger rights say that the airline is obliged to provide hotel accommodation if the delay is overnight. However, we were told by the cabin crew during the descent that we had to book our own accommodation and then ""send them the bill"". We took the alternative option of staying in the airport, as there was only an 8 hour gap before the new flight to Frankfurt departed. Having to spend a night in Munich airport with our 2 year old was not the greatest experience. The food that Lufthansa provided was frankly shocking. Crisps, chocolate biscuit bars and sugary drinks do not constitute a meal, and this disappointment came after no complimentary food was served on the flight into Munich. All the restaurants, cafes and shops in the airport were closed, so we went without an evening meal that day. Lufthansa did provide blankets and pillows, and then we set about trying to find a place to sleep. The designated sleeping area clearly had not been cleaned. There were only 4 private pods which were all taken, so we ended up with a majorly uncomfortable night on the floor of the airport. Perhaps this is not necessarily the fault of Lufthansa, but if they are not going to book hotels for passengers then they should at least make sure the airport sleeping areas are clean. The next morning we boarded our new flight to Frankfurt at 6am. On arrival, I searched out the Lufthansa service desk to make a complaint, but again found an empty desk. Most disappointingly, we were not able to speak to a member of Lufthansa staff that could help during the entire journey. They did sent a breakfast voucher via email, however the voucher was not accepted by the cafe closest to our gate for Muscat, so that meant spending an extra 17 for breakfast for the 3 of us. No further dramas onward to Muscat, however this flight was with a partner airline. It has been over a month since the flight and still no correspondence from Lufthansa regarding the compensation that we are entitled to by law. The only communication we've had was an email telling us to confirm our new itinerary (sent 2 days AFTER we arrived) and an automated email in response to my complaint, which asked me to submit my flight details (which I had already done 3 times by this point). This experience is in stark contrast to a previous experience with KLM, travelling to Dubai via Amsterdam, where we were given the compensation in cash at the service desk, and there was a driver waiting outside to take us to a hotel for the night. We have no desire to travel again with Lufthansa.",negative,-0.713923,1,69,10.397269,6.690842

We had been first in line at check-in, and went back and forth with the representatives for Lufthansa until we had less than an hour til our flight would take off. We were told we had to buy a $3500 ticket. When we attempted to, the airline couldn't verify our information and rejected the purchase. A supervisor for Lufthansa overrode the restrictions and let our last group member through. We made it to our gate and when we went to board the plane, all our tickets were denied. The same supervisor was at the gate and told us our booking agent had canceled all our tickets without authorization. We called the booking agent who said our tickets were still all confirmed from their end. Then we called the Lufthansa customer support representative who we had talked with earlier. She told us someone at the Glasgow Airport had canceled our group and given away our tickets for both flights of our trip home. We were told we would have to buy six new tickets for a later flight. The gate closed but by some miracle, the pilot heard what had happened and let our group on the plane because we had confirmation numbers, boarding passes, and passports. We encountered the same probably at our layover in Frankfurt. At a small security checkpoint, all our boarding passes were flagged. At the gate, the representative told us our flights had been canceled and given away. She seemed unsurprised at the predicament as if Lufthansa had caused similar issues before and assured us she would do her best to get us on the flight home.

But I guess this might just be an older plane and the seats were tight, and there was no storage space or little cubbies. I¡¯m not even a tall person and I found the seats to be less than well padded. The food service was okay, but it was served off of trolleys like you were in coach. We haven¡¯t seen anything like this in another business class. And, they didn¡¯t give an amenity kits.

When you¡¯re paying for business class, you really should get an amenity kit. Even if it¡¯s not the best one in the world. The minimal amount they¡¯re saving, that¡¯s really shameful. Also, they didn¡¯t offer us bottled water until we got off the plane.

The first leg from Brussels to Frankfurt was Okay, I do not remember anything extraordinary about it, it was a short 40 minute flight in a regular plane with a regular very-short-haul experience. The second leg from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv was rather odd. We had a connection of 2.5 hours. When we landed in Frankfurt on time the screens showed us the flight was already boarding, which we found to be very weird. We sprinted to the gate, through connection security and passport control, and were devastated to discover that apparently, Israel has special travel regulations that make all flights landing to Israel go through a special process. Our gate was separated from all other gates, it had extra security and when we passed it we saw there is no plane even at the gate. So after security we were essentially locked in a gate that had only one super-over-priced store selling basic literature and food. We waited for 90 minutes until boarding started. When we sat in the plane the pilot announced that our plane ""has the wrong wheels"" and that it would take us 3 hours to replace all the wheels of the aircraft. All passengers were angry. After 40 minutes the captain announced that we will be brought back to the gate, and transferred to a different aircraft. After an hour buses were organized to the new airplane, same model, A321. Once we arrived there were a few dramas involving passengers that were mad that because the configuration was a bit different in the new plane, couldn't seat next to their loved ones. After an intervention of the German police we took off. The crew was excellent, especially A Stadelmann, who although being very tired as we did, did her best and gave an excellent service. At turbulence when I panicked she noticed and calmed me, we had a quick chat and all in all she was very welcoming, using words like ""dear"" to make me feel warm and welcome aboard the plane. The flight was regular, there was no entertainment, and complimentary soft drinks and disgusting sandwiches were given. We landed in a delay of almost three hours, the flight after the drama went perfectly fine. Lufthansa should check her planes twice before almost letting passengers fly in them!

Price was outrageous, around 6,700 EURO / person, so 21,000 EUR altogether. Service for that price was completely inadequate. Seating: I'm tall but not super tall (6 ft 5''). Did not fit while sleeping into the narrow seat on the A330-300 Business Class, thus couldn't sleep at all. Used to fly a lot between NYC and FRA on the 747-800 (Business Class). That is a completely different size of seat, so it feels like they are trying to fit more seats into Business Class by shrinking the comfort.  Not enough Meals: We were 3 persons on that flight, each person getting their menu at the beginning of the flight. Turns out, they couldn't serve us what we wanted as they did not have enough meals on board. Compare that against the ticket price of 6,700 EURO per person. Also cabin service overall was mediocre ... this is a 9 h 30 min flight and there was close to zero service between meals. You had to actively get up and ask for anything you wanted. Can understand if you try to minimize disturbing sleep of the passengers, but no service is not the answer to that. Lastly, I have gold status (Senator) at LH and was asking at check in if they could connect that flight with my miles account which they said they did ('Are you sure?' Yes!). Turns out, this is not the case. Other than that, check in was nice and helpful.

Lufthansa had bad communication and customer service during my journey to and from Berlin. When flying to Berlin, my second flight from Munich, Germany to Berlin was cancelled. I was never informed by Lufthansa that my flight was cancelled. A friend that I was traveling with told me that my flight was cancelled. The interesting is that his flight was automatically rebooked and mines wasn¡¯t. I had to call customer service and get them to rebook my flight. Traveling to Washington, DC My friend and I found out when we were checking into our flights that we couldn¡¯t check in because our flight could potentially be canceled. We later found out that it was cancelled due to employees striking. Once again, when they officially cancelled my friend flight, he was rebooked automatically with another airline. Lufthansa never rebooked my flight or contacted me to tell me my flight was cancelled. After trying to contact them all day, I finally got through and was only able to get my flight rebooked for two days after I was suppose to leave. So, I had to pay for a hotel room and stay in Berlin for an additional two days that I didn¡¯t plan too. When flying back my flight from Frankfurt to Washington was delayed due to staff shortages. Once I finally get home I later find out that I can not be compensated or reimbursed for my hotel or food for the extra two days that I had to stay in Berlin. Apparently, I¡¯m the EU passenger rights, strikes are considered unfortunate circumstances and you can¡¯t be reimbursed. This was the worth experience ever and I will never fly with Lufthansa again.

I never like to write bad reviews or complaints. The check in process in Vancouver was terrible as the agents are not familiar with the customer service standard at all. The boarding process was slow and delayed. The management were very unprofessional, giving me a negative attitude. The (staff) standard was low class. I would use the word cheap. A company training their ground staff to use cheap flirty tactics on valuable passengers. To me Lufthansa needs a change in managing and training their staff. However the inflight service was relatively ok and the seats were comfortable. The inflight service was ok as the fight attendants had done a good enough job to comfort their passengers. The staff in Frankfurt were ok but not overly impressive. The flight coming back was delayed but it was ok. Overall, I rate the service in Vancouver was unacceptable as it would be 2/10 but inflight was ok 8/10 and Frankfurt staff was 7/10. Good enough for my trip back. Lufthansa really need to upgrade and improve their service in Vancouver. I will be travelling a lot for my new career and I will be an important part of the world¡¯s success going forward. I will be an important person to the country. I do not see Lufthansa as a company who tries to improve but rather a company who tries to hide from the truth.

I knew I had, as a result, already missed LH778 FRA-SIN 29/07/22 before boarding LH1019 BRU-FRA 29/07/22. I raised this query with the staff at the gate and asked if I could be rebooked from Brussels. I was told that I had to take the flight to FRA and get rebooked there after arrival. Once aboard the airplane the captain informed us over the intercom that the plane had been running late all day. We arrived in FRA at 2330 where I was told that rebooking was not possible at that time and that I had to return to the airport the following day to get rebooked. I was given a taxi and hotel voucher. The hotel room stunk like cigarettes, cigarette burns were apparent, the bed was uncomfortable and the street noisy. I returned to the airport the following day at 0900 and waited in line for 5 hours to get to the rebooking counter where I was rebooked and checked-in on the similar route with flights departing the next day At that point my new expected time of arrival at final destination was 1505 on 02/08/22 ¨C delay 50 hours I was not given access to my luggage as these were already checked-in. I was again given a taxi and hotel voucher. The room was unfortunately not air-conditioned. The heat made the night rather short. Hygiene amenities were not available. On 31/07/22 at 1530 I presented myself with my boarding pass to the check-in counter at FRA. I was told that the boarding pass was not valid anymore and that my entire booking had been canceled. The staff at the check in counter were unable to help me and I was again told to line up at the rebooking counter. There, after another 4-5 hour wait, I was told that my entire booking had been canceled by the computer system because it had considered me missing my initial connecting flights as a ¡°no show¡±. In addition to canceling my booking the computer system had also surrendered the seats I had been rebooked on and these were now unavailable. I was then told that Lufthansa was unable to rebook me on a Lufthansa or star alliance flight for a period of at least 4-5 days. After further long delays I was offered a booking through Emirates and was told that that journey was my only option to get back to New Zealand. At this point, my new expected time of arrival at final destination was 1505 on 03/08/22 ¨C delay 74 hours I was again given a taxi and hotel voucher and spent the night at tyet another hotel where air-conditioning was available but unfortunately broken!

Drawing attention to the connection FA told me there are enough flights to Brussels. It was a Sunday however so we missed the connection - the plane was not on the gate and already announced with at least 30min delay - a polite request to organise an extra bus was denied very abruptly. Then they sent us to 3 different counters even one outside the secured area to rebook flights - situation at Frankfurt airport was a disaster. Separate lines for business are not existing anymore. I had to fly to Berlin and from there to Brussels and on that flight I was downgraded ""no availability"" for business.

Flew CRJ 900 from Basel to Frankfurt. Seated in front of exit row. No window and no recline seat. Good thing it was only a 1 hour flight. Frankfurt Airport was horrid. Bussed us from remote pad to A terminal. Then had to walk 3/4 mile through A to C terminal, but required to exit secure zone when left terminal A. There was two separate B terminal security lines which were at least 200 yards long. Figured lots of people would miss flights in that terminal The line for C terminal security took around 45 minutes. Although we had a connection time of 1.5 hours we barely made it through security to the C15 gate in time. When going through the boarding ticket scan I was told I had to pay for baggage which I had already paid on check in at Basel. Gate agent had no record of us paying for baggage which would have cost us another $100. I finally reasoned with gate agent that we had already checked bags in Basel and paid the fee in Basel so they finally waived the extra baggage fee. we boarded the plane exhausted and dehydrated from the walk. After walking as fast as we could From A to C, we did not have time to purchase any water because it would be discarded at security in C terminal. we were thinking we would get a bottle of water on the plane. Sat on ground after boarding for another 1/2 hour. No beverage service for at least 30 minutes after take off. No bottle of water, only a half full 6 oz plastic cup. And no ice. Servers skipped us twice during flight and only offered drink service 30 minutes after takeoff, during the meal two hours into flight and two additional times before the ""snack"" during the 11 hour flight.

Meals were okay, but the cold sandwich (cheese and veggies) was not good. Our flight ended up being over 11 hours due to a detour in Philly because of thunderstorms. We had to sit on the tarmac while the plane was refueled.

A comfortable mini-bus transported us across the airport to a small police office where we had our passports checked, and then back onto the bus and driven across the tarmac to a remote departure gate that we would never have reached on time. We were then escorted to a lift/elevator by Lufthansa staff and into the departure lounge which was only about to board when we arrived.

The Air Canada experience was truly great and a marked contrast to the most disappointing Lufthansa flights . And the Lufthansa Premium Economy experience was a supreme disappointment. In fact - the entire Lufthansa experience was terrible. This starting on their website - in which I wrote a note querying some assistances required. Despite being promised an answer within 2 days, Lufthansa never bothered to acknowledge nor respond! On to the flights, the seating was pretty much the same as economy. And there appeared to be very few toilets on the plane, with access to all and sundry. The food was very poor. The drinks service was abysmal, one drink allowed  and that was it! No doubt Lufthansa on a cost saving program? Found the air hostesses to be less than helpful- and in some instances even rude. Lufthansa premium Economy is sold at a 50% premium to the normal Economy. This is in our opinion an absolute rip off. We most certainly will NOT be flying Lufthansa again.

Did things improve when the departure date actually arrived? No, absolutely not. Lufthansa's online check-in didn't work a single time for me (multiple flights on a round trip) and the queues to try to talk to a Lufthansa employee were absurd at every single airport in my journey.

I was still 10 mins before take off by the time I reached the gate. But there is no plane there because gate has changed and passengers are supposed to get on a bus and get to a different gate. The agent at the gate told me to go to customer service. I waited in line for 1.5 hours to see one. And she told me there is nothing she can do and she keeps pointing finger to the Frankfurt airport, to United airline (the airline that I get the ticket for a flight operate by Lufthansa), and to me! She did nothing but pointing finger. My resolution was calling United and United put me on their own flight tomorrow.

She said Lufthansa has a system and the bag follows wherever I go. So I told her I am flying with another airline and how does that connect with the system of another airline. She said the system can do that but that¡¯s definitely a lie because I have an United agent on the line when everything happens and she told me she cannot see the bag on United system. So the Lufthansa agent just shut the door, lie to people to their faces and intimidate you to make you walk away. I went to the check in Lufthansa counter again and ask where¡¯s my luggage. This time the agent ask how come my luggage is not with me so I told her the whole story again and her comment was what happened to my us on TV everyday and it¡¯s just me being late so I make all these excuses up. In the end, she did told me I need to go to the United counter to have my bag transfer to the United system. I cannot understand how can everyone from Lufthansa so unhelpful and incompetent. And they worst part is they lie so that you walk away and said something untrue to make you feel bad and think they are not the problem. When there is such a long wait at the airport, they need to send out notifications to remind people to come earlier than 3.5 hours, which is already a lot and more than expected.

The seat was great to spend time in that long and the noise of the aircraft is much lower and therefore I enjoyed the journey very much. Staff attitude was ok. I was little surprised that have to pay for spirits, but I can understand this due to the current economic climate in the world. Mainly because i know that I paid far little money for the tickets then others. The main negative was the food. Please make sure that you eat well before travelling, because what you will get inside the plane is absolutely horrible. Overall experience is that it seems that Lufthansa became sort of a sausage factory.  Basically, get in the plane, smile couple times, get food, sleep and when landed get out. I got the flight ticket cheap, but next time I pay more if I wanna get better service with different airline.",negative,-0.374296,1,69,10.397269,6.690842

There was no ground support in Frankfurt and when we arrived at the gate we were faced with ground staff that were rude, unwilling to help and more importantly not on top of the boarding process, allowing all classes to board at the same time and squeeze through two scanning machines. Upon arriving in Helsinki, we received an email from the airline stating our luggage didn't make it and they would keep us updated. The luggage arrived 30 hours later, leaving us with little choice but to do some shopping in the morning to cope with the cooler climate. 2 days later, on our return flight, we couldn't imagine things could go worst. This time our connecting airport was Munich and had several hours to kill. Upon arriving in Athens, we had to wait till all luggage was delivered to realise that one of ours didn't make it and file a missing luggage report. This was the 6th June. To-date, I have heard nothing from the airline. The online tool to monitor the luggage tracing delivers zero updates and lacks any functionality. A week after the luggage was missing, we filed a luggage irregularity report via the PDF form on Lufthansa's website but to my dismay, the ""send"" button refused to take any action. We emailed the airline's support to receive a reply 24 hours later, with some generic content, stating that we didn't provide all needed information. Since then, I have followed up once more and as expected received nothing back. Putting the luggage issues aside, the overall experience of their business class service was totally disappointing. The seats are economy seats with the middle row vacant,  food was mediocre and we were given the same menu on our return journey. ",negative,-0.886954,1,69,10.397269,6.690842

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,22-Jun,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Just 4 short years ago I flew on Lufthansa. I had no issues on my flight to Switzerland, the food was decent (as far as airplane food goes) and I was fairly comfortable (as far as the seating goes). I checked in no problem and well you got me to my point of destination with relative ease, my my my, how that has changed. This airline has made my life living hell in just 24 hours. They have screwed me not once, not twice, but about a million times over. Let's break it down. I am going to start with their website. The website is absolutely appalling in terms of navigation, to find any information on the website, you must navigate the entire website dictionary. Not to mention the pages upon pages of useless code (meaning the pages don't work). I will save you some time by giving you a few pages that don't work - The Baggage Calculator, The COVID 19 Related Documents Uploading Page, The login and Sign Up pages, and a ton of the characters and typography. All I can say is whoever is doing the code for the Lufthansa website needs to fired. Let's move on to baggage. For a long-haul flight, I feel like a personal item (a purse or backpack), a carry-on item (a small bag), and a checked bag are acceptable, especially considering the flight was $1,500 USD. But no. Not on Lufthansa, you have to shove everything you need for a 10-hour flight into a single carry-on bag that must weigh under 8kg. I work with technology for a living and what I need for my job alone weighs 8kg. Unfortunately, I will not be able to pack everything I need for the next 2 years into two bags, so I looked for how much it will cost to take 3 bags. There is not a dang thing on the website on how much it costs to check another bag. So I call Lufthansa. Nothing. So I call again. I could not get a hold of any operator or person even within the business hours, nor would they let me wait on the phone for someone. No contact, how convenient Lufthansa. Website flaw, maybe, customer service flaw, absolutely. It is now just 22 hours away from my flight. I currently live 2 hours away from the airport and can I check in for my flight online...nope, I have to check-in at the airport conveniently located nowhere near me. Oh and just so you are aware, the Lufthansa check-in page doesn't work either. All in all, I would not wish this kind of stress on my worst enemy and lord do I hope that you the customer are not flying on Lufthansa because you won't even be able to check-in for your flight. The worst part is, I haven't even gotten on the plane and I have read bad review after bad review on the actual service and food, so that might be another review coming soon.

The gate where we arrived wasn't even within sight of any airport monitors to check for connecting flight information. My connecting flight had already departed by the time I found the gate. It is just mind-boggling to fly into an airline's home airport on a delayed flight and not have anyone to assist passengers with connections. I found a help desk that booked me on a later flight several hours later. I wrote to Lufthansa to make them aware of my bad experience on May 11. I provided copies of my ticket, boarding passes and reservation. Several days later I got a response from Lufthansa asking for most of the passenger and flight information I provided in the initial email, so I replied again giving them the exact same information that I'd already provided once.

While in the lost luggage office, we received an email from Lufthansa saying that the luggage was delayed and will be dispatched to us at an address of our convenience. They gave us the tracking number and we filled the forwarding address for the luggage. But then after 3 days, the tracking stopped without notice and we lost the trace of our luggage. Last it was seen in Frankfurt we believe. Now, there is no one to contact and the lost luggage office in Bucharest states that there is not much they can do. They advised us to wait and call them everyday. But this hope for the best approach is not what we expected from a company like Lufthansa.

Everybody seems to be in a foul mood always and absolutely not bothered to make the flying experience of its passengers pleasant. In my last flight from Frankfurt to St Louis the quality of the food was pathetic to say the least. It seems the quality of food that was served earlier to Economy class is now being served to Premium Economy. The Economy Class food is not up to the mark of Lufthansa level. Last year I had a very unpleasant experience at Valencia airport while travelling to Dubai and I couldn't fly. I had to buy an Emirates flight as an alternate as it was an urgent journey and I was more than surprised with the excellent service and the quality of the flight.

If you want to upgrade your seats, the service desk is not able to assist or they claim everything is sold out but ask people to keep an eye for availabilities. We naturally did this, and last minute upgraded our seats, only to realize that they sell it nearly for free in the airport - this to advise that we tried to upgrade to business via phone but was told that it was sold out. In the airport they sold business cheaper than we had bought premium economy seats at the day before. Business was nearly empty on the flight and we were not allowed to upgrade in the airport, despite wanting to pay for same, as you can only upgrade once. When boarding we were shocked to see the seats, as the pictures of the class on their web is absolutely not picturing what you actually get.

We managed to upgrade the rest of us to prem eco only to find out, than in 3 weeks they had removed the ""all incl"" in the prem eco, hence limited avails of the drinks (both soft and alch). This wasn't even mentioned while being upgraded. Entertainment on board is very limited or not working. Very few movies, games platform not working at any of the flights and the wifi was not working on any of the flights. The food back from Mexico was not edible - and we are really not having high thoughts for food on board a flight - but when you pay a fortune to get food on board, then you should at least be served food which is being well cooked in order to eat it. Pancakes served for breakfast was not even fried enough to be able to eat it.

The morning omelette was more or less ok, tomato near raw and cold, piece of bread was hard to bite. Also staff were very rude to me. If you ask passengers to wear masks everybody make sure your mask is put properly, not hanging below your nose. In Frankfurt the flight was delayed and service was 1 bottle of water and a small chocolate. ",negative,-0.713166,1,69,10.397269,6.690842

The flight was delayed by a total of 1 hour, leading to a missed connection in Frankfurt. When boarding commenced in Oslo, no dedicated priority boarding was given, there were also no announcements for preboarding disabled flyers or families with small children. Once onboard, staff did not greet us, but directly inquired about the seat row. We found the seat area in business class poorly cleaned and with visible traces of spilled drinks from the previous flight. No welcome drink was served, as is usually the case on Lufthansa. Once airborne, we were served a sausage salad, which was one of the most appalling airline meals I¡¯ve ever had. As dessert we were offered an apple in a paper bag, which we declined. Drinks were served out of synch with the food - here as well the service standards were poor, as all drinks were served lukewarm (including the sparkling wine). We were glad to part with Lufthansa once we landed and will not return as value for money is simply poor and below that of other European airlines.",negative,-0.867835,1,69,10.397269,6.690842

Total chaos, lack of any attempt at communication from staff, miserable logistics at gate and on shuttle to plane, etc. I'm a veteran air traveller both domestically and internationally, and I've never seen such a mess.

The flight was OK but i really felt the food and drink situation was terrible. Johannesburg to Frankfurt was about 10 hours. The first meal consisted of a salad of carrot, squash and aubergine, a roll, a cake with raisins, and a dry pasta with some tomato sauce. Initially, I thought that as the plane was full and I was at the back of the plane that this was the left over option. It transpires that there is only one option and it is vegetarian which doesn't bother me but might others. The pasta was pretty horrible and really felt like something a student might make. Just past and a bit of tomato sauce. the salad was small and bland. The roll and cake were fine. The second meal (breakfast) was a yoghurt a cereal bar and a dry sandwich (also vegetarian). Beer and wine are complimentary but spirits are not and come in at about 7 euros. No snacks or nuts with the drink service though you can buy them. The seat was fine, the entertainment system was difficult to use and had an average selection. The second flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo Haneda which was around 15 hours due to closed Russian airspace was in airbus. The plane was new and clean and the entertainment system was easier to operate. However the food and drink situation was the same. In fact the same nasty pasta was served this time accompanied by a couple of chopped up lettuce leaves. breakfast was the same too. I really felt that for 15 hours on a plane there wasn't much food. I understand that times are tough for the airline industry and that probably Lufthansa are cutting costs with the food and drink service but times are tough for the passenger too and being fed not very much and of poor quality on two different transcontinental flights is a poor showing especially on what is supposed to be a premium airlines.",negative,-0.614829,1,69,10.397269,6.690842

We initially tried to book through Air Canada with this flight, but were informed that as we are travelling with a pet we need to call Lufthansa directly. Everything seemed fine and I gave my debit card details to the operator and was told I'd receive my booking confirmation within 72hrs. After 1 week I didn't receive anything, so I called again and this operation took my card information as if he was booking me another ticket, again I was assured I will receive the booking confirmation within 72hrs. Another week passes and I've received nothing (we can all see the pattern here!), so I call again. This operator told me that the payment couldn't go through as it was a Visa Debit card, so my partner gave her credit card and the payment went through in the time frame or so we thought! We still haven't received a confirmation for our pet in cabin. We call again (several times) to get a confirmation that our pet would be joining us on the flight, we were given 4 different responses, but always promised the confirmation will arrive by tomorrow or 48hrs or 72hrs (depending on who we spoke to). One month passes by and we give up and decide to leave it up to chance arriving with our pet at the airport with the hopes we can take him. But it doesn't end there, about 1.5 months after booking our flights I receive another booking confirmation email for the same flight and the price was taken from my account. So I call and cancel that flight and received a refund of the full amount. I know what your thinking ""It must end here!"", think again. On the day I received my refund I had two more transactions taken from my account, totaling the amount that I was just refunded! In our preparation to move to another continent, I had missed these transactions coming from my account. So the night before my flight, as I was checking in, I noticed and I called explaining my story to the operator, she was no help at all as we were trying to figure out this issue. The call then dropped. Calling back again I got another operator and at this point I wanted to speak to someone with more knowledge, so I asked for the manager. He told me this isn't possible and that he can help me, I expressed that I have called about a dozen times to simply get a flight for 2 people and a pet, I've been booked on the same flight twice and charged three times. At this point I just wanted to speak to someone with a bit more experience. I was put on hold and told it wasn't possible for him to do that, but he did direct me to their website to request a refund, (I mean come on, that's the best you can do, submit a refund for a flight that I've already cancelled?). I thank him for and submit the form, but there was nowhere to upload the documents. So I called again, explained the situation to another person and I was giving an email to send my bank statements to and now I wait!

I had bought round trip tickets from Marseille to Quebec for a price of about 700 in November 2019. The outward journey in January 2020 and the return in April 2020 (Quebec-Montreal-Zurich-Marseille). During the Covid crisis, all flights, including all companies, were cancelled. For Lufthansa also, the company modified the flights, telling me that some of the internal flights were to be modified, around March. It took hours with customer services to find and agree on another internal flight, only for the trip to be cancelled two days later. This has happened several times. The company is now cancelling all these flights in April, which is understandable in view of the global crisis. The postponement of flights is done on the month of May, where the customer service simply tell me that my flight has been moved as is to the following month. A few weeks before departure, internal flights were also cancelled, forcing me to spend hours on the phone to get a new flight and keep my trip. Once done, the flight was cancelled again, telling me that the company had no flights in April and postponed my trip to May. It's also the same story when my May flight date arrives, hours on the phone to change an internal flight after it was cancelled only to be told that my flight has to be rescheduled for June. Except that I consulted the company's website to check if a new reservation was possible. Indeed, the company was operating flights but the tickets were close to 5000$. The company's strategy was simple, postpone my flight booked in November 2019 for 700 to avoid losing a seat which was then sold at five times. I had to buy another ticket (from another company) to be able to return. Obviously the actions to be reimbursed for my return have never given any answers.",negative,-0.820927,1,68,9.729789,-7.69257

But one of its biggest disappointments on the service front is its lack of consistency. On some short-haul flights, the service has been excellent, being addressed by name and frequently checked on if I needed anything, and good food, and on others the service was almost nonexistent. On boarding my flight at Heathrow, and from Munich to London, there was no priority boarding, but the first ten rows ushered in first. There was no welcome, and Anti-bacterial wipes were handed out, but not on the return flights. On the London to Munich sector, breakfast on board was quite substantial, with ham and cheese, cereal, but with cold bread and croissant. On the flights to Rhodes and return to London, the food was unappetizing. One expects a hot meal for lunch and not a concoction of something cold. On the flight from Rhodes to Munich, there were only two passengers in the business cabin. However, the lunch was swiftly served, cleared within about 15 minutes, and the crew not seen until landing. Overall, although there was no interaction with passengers, the cabin crew was efficient and polite. On the drinks front, seconds were not offered, and I had to ask for them. As for seating, it is as most European airlines are, with no extra legroom, except for the middle seat left empty. I was disappointed with the downgrading of Lufthansa's overall in-flight service, and only give my thumbs up for good value when it comes to the ticket price.",negative,-0.663817,1,69,10.397269,6.690842

The only hot meals provided across all flights was the same vegetarian pasta. I¡¯m a bit hung up on the food, but these are extremely long flights and I¡¯ve flown this route several times with several other airlines and have always had good experiences with the meals considering it¡¯s such a long journey.

What is the point of assigning boarding groups when all but priority passengers are called to board at the same time? Seats in economy were akin to a budget airline with minimal legroom, no headrest or entertainment. Cabin was not clean, and crew handed out alcohol wipes. On both legs I took with Lufthansa there was no food or drink available, complimentary or paid. This was a 2 hour service right about lunchtime.

Worst of all was the terrible spacing/leg room in economy class. It is big enough for a 10 year old kid but not for a normal size adult. It really felt like the airline wanted to cramp in more passengers to make up for the losses incurred during the pandemic without any regard to the comfort of passengers.

It started with check in, which in Berlin is done by a contract company that is not able to provide its agents with accurate information on entry requirements. I had a long argument with the agent who nearly refused to issue my boarding passes although I had all the necessary documents with me (and no problem at all at immigration in Dubai later). Flight from Berlin to Munich on time, but otherwise nothing to praise about it. Lufthansa has introduced a buy on board service on domestic and European flights, but they didn't offer anything on this flight, so even if I had wanted, I couldn't get a coffee or snack. Munich airport is very easy to transfer, but repeated document checks at the gate resulted in a delayed departure. First time flying in Lufthansa's premium economy, and while I liked the seat comfort and additional space, it's disappointing that the service has been reduced to exactly the same as in regular economy, apart from a tiny glass of juice after boarding. They also cut the nuts or crackers with the first drink round, and they now serve coffee or tea together with the meal. That doesn't make any sense as your coffee will be cold once you have finished the meal. On the other hands, portions are shrinking year by year, so there is quite a chance that the coffee is still warm.

Once onboard, the overhead bin filled up quickly. Cabin crew were standoff-ish, saying that it was not their job to facilitate the space arrangement.  The flight was further delayed because passengers continued to run up and down the aisle to find space. Once arrived in Frankfurt, there was nobody at the gate to facilitate connecting passengers, so everyone ran for themselves. My second flight FRA-LHR was also further delayed for unknown reasons. Upon boarding, I was told to go to another gate staff to have my documents checked for COVID & locator form etc. The other staff  refused to do it because it wasn¡¯t her duty, whilst the one holding that duty was nowhere to be found.

The food served on my business class flights were uninspired tasteless sandwiches. They looked similar to the sandwiches Lufthansa used to serve in Economy until a few months ago. If this is their strategy to attract full fare paying guests in Business they really got it wrong. It¡¯s an absolute disgrace for people paying so much money expecting a standard above average. If this is the new Lufthansa I may as well consider flying low cost for my next flights and just pay for food sold on board. It would be a massive saving,negative,-0.67011,1,68,9.729789,-7.69257

Living close to their German hub, I use this airline for world-wide travels, both for business and private needs. In the past, the airline delivered not perfect but pretty good services as on the ground as well in the air. The last 5 years the situation has changed drastically. I had multiple serious issues on the ground and in the flight, when Lufthansa staff demonstrated a full ignorance or arrogance to the passengers. The numerous complains to the support line result in formal response without any real measures. The COVID pandemics worsened this disaster service even to more catastrophic. I could provide my personal tens of examples how the Lufthansa employees treat the customers in bad manner, starting from business lounges and further at boarding and in airplane, however, this review is not aimed to make a long story but just to express the general status of the services by Lufthansa. Last but not least, recent changes in price policies and in-flight services just confirm the general trend of company degradation. For example, on some international flights longer than 2 hours (flight FRA-LED), which I recently used, there is no more complimentary food/drinks service. The ticket price, however, increased! As a summary, using often other air carriers, I have to say that Lufthansa is rather located in the very end of the list of quality providers.",negative,-0.683037,1,68,9.729789,-7.69257

In-Flight Service : Very friendly and accommodating as Lufthansa has been in the past. Seat-Comfort - Due to the half empty flight, I was happily able to stretch out. However, even in a full flight, the seat would have been above average by economy standards. I can recommend the mini-economy cabin in front of economy plus on this particular plane. Food/Beverages - Good selection of beverages. Meals were fine (Ravioli for dinner and a sandwich box for breakfast), but nothing special by economy standards. No choice food alternative choice was provided. Entertainment - A bit of a more dated touch system, that was a bit sticky to navigate, but overall a good selection.

Both planes were clean. Both crews were courteous. Then the bad news time comes. Online check in was disabled. I arrived to check in desk at CDG2B 3 hours before departure (guessed that all who normally use online check in should be already there). My guess was just partly correct. Not just all Lufthansa, but also Swiss, Austrian and some other airlines sadly shared 3 or 4 staffed desks to check in all the flights to Munich, Frankfurt, Zurich, Vienna and God knows where else. The queue was endless and moving in the slowest possible pace. Things looked quite scary, so I opted to go directly to business class check in with my Turkish frequent flyer card (unsure whether eligible for that). After some 25 min of wait (at business class line folks) I was checked in and given tags for my carry-on.  Boarding was a mess. Calling passengers by groups (to lessen physical contact I guess) gate agents then asked everyone to form a standing queue near the gate door within a small space providing close physical contact. Then the gate door opened, so people were able to board, and without airline staff guidance things got back to normal. Onboard it was ok. The seat back recline has been eliminated since new A320NEO came to fleet, so seat comfort is now not on par with low cost carriers. A bottle of water and wet napkins were handed out. We took off and landed on time. Disembarkation in Munich also went by groups. It slowed things down, but not badly. Then boarding flight to Kyiv was another stupid quest. Without any announcement all the passengers were re-directed to another gate. There instead of boarding we had to get our boarding passes stamped. But with stamped boarding passes instead of boarding the plane we were diverted to the initial gate where they were trying to enforce boarding by groups ignoring the fact that stamping passports was not done by groups, so they were finally able to form quite a big disorganized crowd. Boarding took forever and some more covid infection was spread in this interesting way. Onboard it was uneventful. Overall disorganized, incompetent on the ground, uncomfortable in the air, overpriced and unworthy. I tried their inflight wireless.

? Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to Vancouver,21-Aug,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  My daughter was denied boarding.  The adventure began already in the night before the flight when I tried to check-in my daughter electronically. This was not successful, because electronic check-in of LH asks whether or not a visa is available. In an exchange program, there is no visa, however, but an ""application approval"" and the visa is issued at the local airport upon arrival. Such a possibility is, unfortunately, not available within the electronic check-in at LH and electronic check-in could, therefore, not be performed. We arrived at the airport 4 hours before departure. As soon as our flight was indicated, we went to the indicated counters. However, only an electronic check-in was possible there. This check-in did not provide for the possibility to check-in children belonging to the exchange program either. Therefore, we went to the counters where check-in took place physically. After a long line, we were ready to have our documents checked. Although the documents were alright, the women at the counter still had to consult her manager because she was not sure if the documents were in order. When she was back, she confirmed that the docs were alright, but said that it was too late now and the gate had already closed and would not be opened for boarding for my daughter. Despite the fact that there was still over an hour before departure and that all other airlines I have experience with close their gates just before departure, LH refused to accept my daughter. Lufthansa fails to realize that it has a contract with the passengers and that not only passengers have obligations, but also LH has and it is expected to make an effort to find a solution, in particular in a situation which does not really presents a problem. Not to mention any kind of services which is fully missing on the side of LH. All in all, I consider this procedure unacceptable. Two days before departure, I wanted to clarify one more point with LH and called LH's information desk at 23:00. According to the information on LH?s website, the support line is open until midnight. The announcement on the phone was that all the lines were overloaded and the waiting time was 20 minutes. Since the clarification was important to me, I decided to wait. After waiting until 23.50, I hung up.

The A320 to Frankfurt was new and spotless. The crew went around handing out a single alcohol towelette to each passenger in a great display of hygiene/safety precautions (other airlines give you masks, gel, wipes, etc). Each passenger was given an individual bottle of mineral water  and Swiss-style chocolates. That was it, for an early evening flight. On the FRA-HKG leg, there was no choice of dish for dinner or the usual apology of ""sorry, we have run out of"" -  some penne in tomato sauce. Breakfast was very skimpish and un-German (picture).

Their service on the plane itself is OK. However, Lufthansa does not allow rebooking online if your flight gets cancelled or there are complications due to coronavirus. Moreover, if there is a government-imposed travel ban, they will not allow you to have refund (only rebooking, usually at a very high price because the last-minute booking is usually twice or three times the price of the original ticket). Other flight companies allow for refund, but Lufthansa is instructing their call service to deny the refunds and rebooking cannot be done online. To rebook, you need to call their call service, which is a nightmare. I tried to rebook 3 times. First time I was on hold for about an hour. Then, I explained the situation, was put on hold, and after 1 hour of waiting was disconnected from the line. This same thing happened 3 times.

I had to buy a new ticket due to this but all flights to Milan were sold out so I chose to fly direct to Rome and then to Belgrade (which I did). On the way back (Aug 1) I caught my flight from Belgrade (FL# LH1411) at 6:00am. The flight was 30 minutes taking off and we were airborne at 6:33am to Belgrade. My connecting flight in Belgrade was also on Lufthansa to Milan. The flight landed at 7:50am, my connecting flight (LH 248) was departing at 9:00am. The Frankfurt airport was crazy busy with very long lines. After deboarding the plane, I ran with computer back and check in luggage in tow to find the connecting gate. The first passport control (8 minutes away) line had about 4 windows open with about 30 people in each line. I asked one of the staff that I have a flight leaving very soon and I will miss it, is there anyway I can get to the front of the line, she said you have to wait. I waited about 10-15 minutes and the line hardly moved. I then went up to the airline staff window and pleaded with the man there that I would miss my plane. He looked at my boarding pass, stamped me and let me through (thank you!). I then ran about 5 minutes more to a send security passport check to get to the connecting gate. I waited in line for about 5 minutes and then was allowed through. I ran to my gate and arrived at 8:50am. I handed the lady at the gate desk my boarding pass and she simply said.. ""The plane has left"".  I asked her how the plane could leave early when they  have a manifest that shows there is a passenger on this plane connecting from a flight from Belgrade. She simply looked at me and said ""I'm sorry the plane is gone"". She then handed me a card that had a Lufthansa website address on it to lodge my complaint. (I have since lodged a complaint, to which Lufthansa replied that they have ""no fault in this"" - Unbelievable!) My question is: How can they simply just leave knowing there is a connecting passenger coming from another flight, and why would they leave 9-10 early!?

Second, my bag did not arrive in my final destination. Strange considering I had one connection in Frankfurt of several hours, which is where Lufthansa's automated system says the bag was held up.

The day before the flight on July 24th, I went online to do my check in and just want to make sure everything is okay then I noticed Lufthansa had cancelled my flight without booking me another flight back to the US, meanwhile, I paid for round trip. So I spent last day of my vacation 4 hours on the phone trying to solve this issue. First, it¡¯s so hard to find a valid number to call Lufthansa for customer service. When we finally found a number to call, then it says they only work Monday to Friday. Long story short, I finally was able to rebook my flight for July 25th at 9.10AM. Boarding is so slow and inefficient. We were supposed to leave at 9.10AM but we did not leave until 9.40AM due to slow boarding. I originally paid/ booked premium economy seat, while they rebook me they downgrade my seat to regular economy. Then I have a connection flight from frankfurter to JFK at 11.00AM. While in the air I asked a crew member that I have connection flight if I can still make it and she said yes, if I ran. I ran through the immigration and I asked the guy who worked at the immigration again if he thinks I can make it then he told me he doesn¡¯t think so because of the gate is very far, the farthest gate it¡¯ll take me about 10+ mins if I run (Z68). When I finally ran to the gate, airline employees told me the boarding has closed. I missed my flight while my other fellow American who ran with me said while they were told this connection flight will wait for us. Then we were told there is no more flight out to NY JFK anymore for the day. We can either wait until tomorrow or go to Newark NJ. (But my car is parked at JFK long term parking). Then we have to go to another gate (Z12) to the counter in order to rebook our flight. Anyway, so I took that flight at 1:20PM (again they put me in regular economy while I paid for premium economy). Because of the whole chaos that Lufthansa put me through now I end up in Newark. So I have to figure out an Uber home or arrange pick up by friends while I have my own car parked at JFK where I booked my final destination to.

Terrible economy seats - they recline but the seat pad does not move forward like others airlines such as Emirates, Turkish, Ethiopian, etc. Many rude flight attendants. Unsurprising given most are German, but still, should be more pleasant. No meal choices. Every other airline I have ever flown has offered at least some food choice ~ meat, chicken, fish, etc. Not Lufthansa! It was pasta with tomato sauce and wasn't even tasty. I sent emails to the Lufthansa customer relations department. Here is the context of my email. We traveled from Frankfurt to Johannesburg on flight LH572, departing on June 3 at 22.05, which lasted approximately 10 ? hours. During this time, we experienced disrespect, rudeness, and overall unpleasant attitudes and service by some of your flight attendants. We were seated in row 32, seats G, H and K. I understand that food is limited, however, when we inquired if our daughter could have an alternate meal, the female flight attendant blurted out ¡°Everyone has the same thing! If you wanted a special meal, you should have requested it before the flight.¡± That¡¯s fine, but the insensitive and rude behavior of this flight attendant was not acceptable, by any culture! When the plane pulled into the gate at Johannesburg, the fasten seat belt sign was turned off. I stood up to stretch my legs as I am tall and my knees hurt. Again, this flight attendant shouted at me to ¡°sit down until you are told to get up!¡± Is this the type of behavior that is tolerated by your airline? Based on reactions from other passengers on this flight, I certainly was not alone in my feeling of disrespect, almost disdain, by some of your flight attendants, as I was not the only passenger she yelled at. Received only a ""canned"" response to my inquiry. Based on this single experience, I'll never fly this airline again.",negative,-0.81766,1,68,9.729789,-7.69257

It never was put on the plane. Then they tell us it will be sent to us in Aswan. We¡¯re there for 2-3 days so they have time to get it to us before we get on our Nile Cruise. They never tried to send it to Aswan. Now we just heard we won¡¯t get our luggage until we go back to the Cairo airport and retrieve it in person. Why? Because they honestly don¡¯t care. They don¡¯t think it¡¯s their problem that we don¡¯t have our luggage. Reminder that we¡¯re not just in a foreign country, but in Egypt. We have a body guard assigned to us from the Egyptian government to escort us whenever we leave our hotels. ¡°Go buy some essentials and we¡¯ll refund you 50% of the cost.¡± First off, even refunding me 100% of the cost is not enough to even begin to cover this inconvenience. There¡¯s clothes, snacks, and other items in my luggage that I bought specifically for this trip that I¡¯ve now bought in vain because I will never use them.  I saved up money, which is precious right now during the pandemic, to come here and enjoy myself! If my luggage was delivered to me in a timely fashion, I wouldn¡¯t have been able to relax and enjoy myself rather than almost have a breakdown.  I¡¯ve gone through experiences while traveling that have been less than ideal to say the least. I can honestly say this is the first time I¡¯ve ever experienced an airline that is this incompetent. I will never fly Lufthansa again. ",negative,-0.635552,1,67,9.517016,-8.813736

Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Heraklion to Brussels via Athens and M¨¹nich,20-Dec,4,5,3,,,4,1,no,1,"  We booked a return flight with Lufthansa assuming that if something would go wrong in these Corona days it would get solved. What a mistake ! Our return flight from Crete to Brussels on the 19th November was cancelled and the proposal we received by e-mail was a flight from Athens to Brussels. When I called their customer support the first proposal was a flight on November 30 (11 days later) leaving 6:55 in the morning and arriving 20:50 in the evening. There were flights available leaving 6:55 arriving 10:50 several times a week but we could not be booked on those because we did not have the right booking class. I was asked to call again later, maybe other options would become available. The next time I called the proposal was even better: we would leave on the 29th and arrive on the 30th (a stay in a hotel was not included). I could contact customer relations if I did not like this, which I did. The only answer I got from them was that their customer services were able to handle this problem. After calling 5 or 6 times they finally arranged a flight for us: on the 1st December. At least that was what I understood because when I received the e-mail it said the 5th. When I tried to get this changed I was told that I would have to pay because I confirmed their alternative. When they were calculating the cost they ended the call so I gave up and booked a flight with another airline and got home without problems. Off course I did not want to throw away the money I spent on the Lufthansa ticket so I tried to rebook it for next year. Again a huge mistake. If the flight was booked as a return flight on their website it would cost only 8 more than my original ticket, but as a single ticket it would cost  150 more.

Seems they had an error in their system and that the transactions did not go through and they did not inform me. The personnel at the airport asked me to claim for a refund on the difference between the online and the airport fees, so I did. After I explained my case, Lufthansa recognized that it was their fault but they would not give me my money back. I insisted to talk to a supervisor and I was denied to do so.

Only after numerous attempts did I get through to Lufthansa only to be cut off in the middle of my call. I tried to call 4 or 5 more times to simply be cut off before anyone answered the call. I then tried using the Miles and More member number, I got through after just a few minutes and was helped by a courteous friendly assistant who, after 5 minutes, re-allocated the original seats. At no time did Lufthansa inform me of this change or of the fact they had seated two people on the same booking some 15 rows apart. I wrote an email to Lufthansa on 29.06 asking for an explanation on 23.07 received an automated replay that did not address my question. The seat numbers continued to change in the days leading up to the flight at least the changes were in the same area. 48 hours before the flight the screen showed that the seats ""could not be pre-booked on this leg of the journey¡§ but could be selected at time of check-in? In line with an apparent Lufhansa ""Covid19 code of conduct"" during this whole seat reservation farce the seat next to a booked seat was shown as ""non-bookable"" .. an intelligent and logical move, a positive Lufthansa initiative. However on boarding the plane (after ground staff informing us the pre-booked boarding assistance was ready! I had no requested this and after a brief discussion the whole thing was dismissed with indifference and lack to interest on their part. Upon boarding to my surprise people I saw that in fact passengers were sitting in the ""non-bookable seats"" .. no Covid19 distancing as implied by Lufthansa. In addition to being incompetent during the booking and boarding process they were also lying about their ""responsible seating policy"", Additionally boarding was more chaotic than normal, people queuing in the aisles, moving from the back to the front of the plane: evidence of the Lufthansa ¡°dynamic seating process¡±. During the flight the FAs handed out 3 documents in a disorganized and giggly fashion, requesting us to complete them. The request was in unclear/garbled English and German. When unable to fill out 1 form (as none of the options applied to me) I asked the FA how to proceed: she replied ¡°I don¡¯t know, I?m just a FA, just fill in something!¡±  One form was handed back to the FA, the other 2 had to be handed to the French authorities at passport control/security at Lyon arrivals. There were no officials at Lyon arrivals, no passport or security controls. One document was only valid for nationals from non-EU countries (plus UK, Norway.) The FA clearly had not understood the forms she was handing out. On the return flight I received a ¡°Boarding Gate change¡± on my phone, the new gate being quoted as G26. As I was unable to find any ¡°G¡± gates I asked a security guard where the G area was (no ground staff were at the original boarding area). We were then called to board (at the original gate) only to be kept standing for 15 min while the confused and theatrical ground staff gave us unclear and contradictory information.

Frankfurt airport is operating out of just the one terminal: Terminal 1. This means that the terminal was cram-packed full of people. There was only one restaurant open and it was expensive and the quality of the food was pretty poor.  The flight to Bilbao was approx. 2 hours, and during this flight they only gave out one bottle of water per person - all in the claim that it is because of COVID-19. The following morning, I received an email from Lufthansa - apologising that there have been changes made to my booking and asking me to either accept the new conditions, or choose not to and keep the flight open. The problem was that there was no alternative flight option shown. Lufthansa cancelled my return flight and didn't give me the option of rescheduling my return flight on 24th July. I went online and entered my booking details into their site and only my outbound flight was showing up. My ticket had been changed to a one-way ticket.

As I read (or mis-read online) there was supposed to be a button in the online environment to click to issue a re-fund and so I did. Time goes by and of course they violate their own policy of returning the refund. The real problem for me starts in their communication. I've been trying to get hold of their customer service for the past 5 months by e-mail or by phone. Their phone lines are either flat out busy or cut out after 2 hours of being on hold. I've gotten hold of their employee's once in twenty1 hour calls.  I've gotten some written feedback but basically, none of it was anything more than that they acknowledged the situation but can't provide any help. Feedback on my ticket telling me they cant respect their deadlines.Me forwarding the claim to my credit card company. Lufthansa re-reviews the ticket but tells they can't help me without any argumentation. Creditcard company tells me I need a statement that my flight got cancelled (which i didn't got), so I re-approach via a ticket. I get hold of Lufthansa once by phone and they inform me I cancelled the ticket myself  because their system processed my action as a cancellation and they mention to me they can't see the flight was actually cancelled. Spoiler alert, the airport was closed, it was. I'm advised to re-make a flight disruption ticket to explain this. Here is specifically ask for a confirmation of the flight cancellation. Not a refund but instead of sending me that, they issue me to the refund department.

The person who served me was nice and personable, the rest were just going through the motions as quickly as possible. Went to the kitchen a few times to get water. Had to ask for ice and was served out of almost flat mineral water bottles. Soft drinks were served out of bottles into glasses, small amounts, had to ask for more. Food was reasonably tasty but nothing special and portions were small. More of a Degustation size/type menu than proper meals. Very disappointing. My wife and daughter, who were sitting further up front could not get another croissant nor the scrambled egg choice for breakfast because they were none left and the server was grumpy to them.

Short hops between LHR-FRA were on new A320-neos in both directions and were perfectly comfortable with a small snack provided. Long haul A340-300s used to Chennai say they are 'operated by Lufthansa Cityline' but the passenger experience is identical to normal Lufthansa. Seats are comfy enough with adjustable headrests, sufficient pitch for 6'2 male and decent recline for night flying; managed to sleep almost 5 hours! Although the planes may be getting on now, the interior feels very freshly refurbished and still love Airbus A340/A330 planes in economy with just 2-4-2 layout - much better than Boeing's now standard 3-4-3. Entertainment was good quality screen with decent enough selection with probably about 70-odd movies though a poor selection of mostly German TV programmes. The meal just before Christmas was delicious goose, sauerkraut and dumplings, and with metal cutlery too, then a small sandwich-sized snack before landing. Toilets were kept clean (though maybe best to avoid being too close to them as they got a bit whiffy at times and with all 5 loos together in the middle of the plane, lots of footfall during flight), cabin crew were efficient and were perfectly friendly with me - as a German speaker they seemed to reserve a special extra level of smile when someone spoke German, but I saw several being very direct with other non-native English speakers regarding putting bags in lockers and one seat assignment at the start of the flight. An Indian chap in his 40s found someone sitting in his seat and sought help from an FA to talk to the person, to which she replied condescendingly, ""I think you're old enough to ask that yourself, aren't you?""

IFE okay. Of course seat width, pitch and hardness were awful. Love the plane, hate the configuration. No info pre-landing about connections or ground personnel to facilitate what became a tight connection due to delayed arrival. Return to Orlando, possible same aircraft. Problem this time was logistics of transfer in Frankfurt. Inbound flight from AMS late and then gate hold issue. Close connection quickly became a crisis. Ironically, I had hurt my back during trip so requested assistance in transfer. None was present on arrival in Frankfurt. Ground agent said gate change had messed up meeting. Arrived Terminal 1 gate 29, outbound Concourse Z gate 69 with 20 minutes to connect! Ground agent scolded me for making too tight connection. I said LH booked it that way, I am just the customer. Finally contract ground service arrived and two women loaded me into wheelchair and sprinted me through concourse, Passport Control, through tunnel, up elevator and then onto electric cart for high speed ride to Gate Z 69 which was at least a mile downrange, still. Made it just in time. If I had not had excellent help from ground personnel, would have definitely missed the one daily flight to Orlando. LH was non-responsive at best and spent more time trying to assign blame to me, than fix the problem.  I always thought LH performed well, if somewhat sternly.

The Senator Lounge in Berlin is in free fall. There was a lot of talk about the new Senator Lounge. In the end, the new one is worse than the old one. The choice of food and drinks is very limited. For breakfast, there used to be at least three choices of cold cuts and cheese; now, it is one each. The croissants are gone, the toast has gone, there is only one kind of sliced bread. There is no free champagne anymore, the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks selection has suffered considerably. Shame on Lufthansa for giving such a bad impression in their lounges in the German capital. The departure from Berlin was 30 minutes delayed because of the late arrival of the incoming aeroplane. However, the announcement was only made when it was already time for the pre-boarding announcement. As I was in a good position overlooking the apron, I knew that the aeroplane had not even come yet, but, to many other passengers, this came as a most unpleasant surprise, as a lot of them seemed to have short connection times in Frankfurt. The aeroplane left with a delay of more than 30 minutes; the flight itself was quite good. In Business Class, they served a tray containing a plate with slices of roast chicken, vegetables and pesto, accompanied by some bread rolls with butter as well as some panna cotta with cherry sauce and clotted cream. For me, there was enough connecting time in Frankfurt, as I knew exactly how I could get from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 quickly. I spent some 20 minutes in the Senator Lounge. It was quite empty for that time of day. The food served reflected the fact that the Oktoberfest in Munich had started. It was all very Bavarian ¨C the same you get in the Munich lounges all year round. Within the 50 minutes I was in Frankfurt, the departure gate changed at least four times from B30 to B20 to B27 and finally to B28. The flight from Frankfurt to Tivat was the real disappointment. The flight was more than twice as long as the inner-German flight from Berlin to Frankfurt, but the food served on board to Tivat was exactly the same as on the previous flight. I mean how is this possible? How can it be that Lufthansa ¨C a so-called 5-star airline ¨C offers the same kind of food on two different flights at two different times of day with different flight duration? Frankfurt is Lufthansa¡®s main hub; the vast majority of the passengers have connecting flights here. Is that the impression Lufthansa tries to leave? Austrian, a Lufthansa-group member, is able to serve a hot meal on all international flights no matter how long it is.

Few more km walk out of secure area finally found service centre. Guy very helpful,  but then had to go thru security again. Thankfully our new later flight left on time finally home!

The flight kitchen at NBO seems to be unable to deliver quality food, at least not for business class. Compared to Swiss, which flew us to NBO, Swiss is worlds better, incl. the food.

On board, the hard product offered decent space for one¡¯s belongings but the fact that not every seat has direct aisle access remains a downside for LH business class. The seat offers limited privacy and the fact that it is angled towards the neighbour, makes it quite awkward in the fully flat position as a mere 1 inch divider separates the respective foot wells. The seat was narrow compared to business class seats found on other carriers. It was not particularly comfortable in the lie flat position. The service was in typical LH fashion, efficient but lacking warmth. The food and wine offerings were quite good however, the salad consisted of limp mesclun greens and was sort of thrown onto the tray. The snack served prior to landing was actually better tasting than the lunch offering consisting of a delicious soup and very tasty prawns. The IFE had a good selection and I especially enjoyed the cameras showing the exterior of the aircraft. The toilets were kept in immaculate condition throughout the flight.

The rules are that dogs can fly in cabin as long as they are secured in their carrier during take off and landing and when the seatbelt light goes off the dog is allowed to sit in your lap. I asked the rules several times before traveling because she hates being in a carrier and goes crazy barking and crying. I even got her tranquilizers from the vet just for her to be able to deal with those few minutes she has to be in the carrier. This is the way we traveled to Europe a few weeks ago. Nice and smooth she made it thru.  Lufthansa banned me from flying their airline because my dog, who came out of her carrier by poking her head out, mid flight and was barking! This pilot demanded At the beginning of the flight to keep her in the carrier the whole flight and told me that that is the rules. My poor dog hates being in the carrier, I probably would¡¯ve not brought her if that was really the rule because she barks and cries when she¡¯s in the carrier. I asked the pilot why he would not use his own discretion with his rules, for my dog will make the whole plane crazy by barking while being locked in a small box. It¡¯s the rules.  I did what he told me anyway and my dog barked for 25 minutes straight while I apologized to the other passengers. So we landed in Frankfurt to catch our connecting flight to Miami and the stewardess told me that we cannot board the plane. Mind you that flight to and from the US, ESA¡¯s are allowed to sit on your lap the entire flight, landing, taking off and all.

Credit must be given to the crew on board as they had to put up with this situation for not fault of their own but because of the incompetence and unprofessionalism of the company. To add insult to the injury my luggage didn't make it to the second plane and it was still in Frankfurt (despite being an easier journey through the airport than mine) so I had to spend another 25 extra minutes to go through the queue and forms at the baggage handling company desk in Madrid.

But Lufthansa showed their human side and helped everyone get home while paying respect to the person that's lost their life on the road.

Lufthansa currently has a problem with its catering agents - it seems that very little food is available on short-haul flights in Europe. This downgrades the flying experience to something like that of a budget airline. On the short flight from LHR to FRA passengers were given one biscuit. On the second flight from FRA to OPO we were given a chocolate bar. That's it. That was the extent of the food service on the 2 Lufthansa flights totalling more than 4 hours. Additionally, a 10-minute thunderstorm in the Frankfurt are was converted into an arrival delay of almost one hour. There was little in the way of apology from Lufthansa.

I have chosen this airline for many years as a family friendly airline and for its reputation. Unfortunately when I traveled this time it was a total disaster leading me to write this review. I consider myself a frequent flyer, having done this trip over twenty times but never with an infant. I have a multitude of complaints including complete disregard from crew and personnel, unsanitary conditions on the flight and rude service. I am extremely disappointed and will never choose this company again after paying $1700 for this roundtrip ticket. First, I paid extra for a special seat to accommodate my daughter and I and found myself in the middle row. I understand that I chose to have her in my lap as these were the only options given to me during booking. Secondly, the staff in economy was extremely rude and unaccommodating to our situation and even refused us a bottle of water. Thirdly, the conditions in the plane were a disgrace. People were throwing up in the aisle, multiple passengers had their bare feet on the seat rests and television monitors with no consideration for others and the crew did nothing to remedy this. I was horrified at the thought of changing my infants diaper in the bathroom under these conditions. Lastly, no one showed any consideration or patience while aware that I was carrying an infant, a stroller and two carry-ons while boarding and deplaning and no one offered a seat on the bus that brought us twice to two different terminals forcing us to stand and trying not to loose our balance. I understand that I am not in control of the behavior of others, but the crew showed complete indifference towards this and lacked complete empathy for the passengers on this flight and my daughter and I. I believe that the crew's lack of care reinforced an atmosphere of total indifference. I also want to add that in Boston at the check-in I was charged an extra $60 USD for my daughters check-in baggage.

I have found Lufthansa becoming more and inconsistent in their performance. On the first leg, we had secured nice exit seats with plenty of leg space, to be told at the gate that we had instead been upgraded to business class. However, this is is the first time in 25 years of travel that I get an upgrade, and the service offering is a down-grade. First off, the seat pitch is less than in economy class (compared to the exit seats we had). Then, it turns out that there is not enough business class catering, so  we each get a KitKat snack to keep us happy. Suffice to say that If I can afford to pay more than 1000 USD for a ticket, I can afford to buy an unhealthy snack for 50 cents. The purser expressed that she was ""sorry"". I acknowledge her statement, but I would much more appreciate her fixing the problem. The long-haul portion of the trip was average. The IFE and power supply did not work for me and the people sitting next to me, and it took the crew hours to figure this out. I had ordered Lufthansa's a la carte dining, which has been very good in the past. Today, parts of the meal were very unattractive. I cannot believe that they have the heart to charge 30 EUR for a rip-off of this sort. A final observation from the long-haul part was that we spent almost an hour holding at the tarmac at LAX, after landing, before finally arriving at our gate This was handled very poorly by the cabin team. I was for instance able to get off the plane before almost all premium passengers. In conclusion, not Lufthansa's finest day, by far. Would I fly them again? Perhaps, but they would not be my first choice, and they are not a five-star airline.",negative,-0.563407,0,66,10.502983,7.101676
