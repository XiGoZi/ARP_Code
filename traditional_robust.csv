? Trip Verified ,Boeing 777,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Paris to Toronto,24-Jul,2,1,1,1,,4,3,no,5,"  Disappointing Premium Economy onboard experience on flight segment from CDG to YYZ in July 2024 with AirFrance. Journey segment originated in AMS, and the SkyPriority AMS airport was quick to check-in and drop-off luggage, with express security line, but wasn't really needed since the regularly security lines were moving just as quick. The AF Premium Economy experience on the trans-Atlantic segment was a real disappointment though, and should next time choose one of their SkyTeam members like KLM or Delta instead. Seats and cabin interior were dirty. Crumbs, dirt, and hairs evident on the seat, storage areas, food surfaces, and floor. Headphones are built-in cord-connected to the plane, with a sticker claiming they have been sanitized after each use, which I'm not so sure off. Service on the plane is really disappointing, with crew really not friendly at any point during the flight. They look angry, don't smile, and try to avoid any service as possible. Was almost impossible to get a drink at any time during the flight, as they don't answer the attendant call requests either. If you can the attention of a steward to request a drink, they are served in such small paper cups, and then filled only half full, so it's basically the portion of a Costco drink sample. In flight hot meal was a disgusting mushy pasta with mushed peas puree and it didn't look any better. Best part was the dinner roll with butter. Late night snack was a cold soggy bun with a super thin layer of pre-spread hummus, which was also quite gross. If this was the service and food in Premium Economy, I can't imagine what Economy was like. Online reviews said Air France Premium Economy was good and I was looking forward to it, but now I wouldn't recommend it. Would opt for a different airline.",negative,-0.679261,0,91,9.826499,6.990257

I had a terrible experience due to them overbooking my paid for flight. Being an international flight, they rebooked me a full 24 hours later causing me to miss a whole part of my trip and booked itinerary. They were rude and unhelpful when I reached out to them to ask for compensation due to missed tours and hotel stay that I could not be reimbursed for. They wouldn't admit to any wrongdoing and blamed it on my connecting flight that was delayed, even though I still arrived to the gate with plenty of time to board and had checked in online. They did not provide any compensation and would not admit to their overbooking being the cause of me not getting to Paris as I had booked. The letters and follow up I received were rude with no empathy for what was a nightmare travel experience. I have flown internationally and booked many trips, never have I experienced such an awful situation as this. It was a first time trip to Paris for me and I never want to go again, especially with this airline. For whatever it is worth, I hope this helps someone else if on the fence with booking - I don't like to complain but somehow I needed to do what I could to hold this airline accountable for my experience.

Recently, during a multi-stop trip, we experienced 3 separate terrible experiences, leaving us unwilling to fly Air France again. First, from LAX to CDG, our flight was expected to be delayed which would result in our missed connection out of CDG. We were informed the morning of, and we were automatically, without our input/consent, changed to another flight later in the day. It took a 2 hour long phone call to convince the Air France representative that our preference was to remain on our original flight (despite the missed connection), and that they should not have assumed our preference was to take the later flight (which would not have made it to CDG in time for our connection anyway). The Air France representative insisted that I was the one who had requested the change during an earlier phone call, which was a blatant lie. Next, from BCN to CDG, our flight was canceled due to smoke detected in the rear of the plane. While we truly appreciate the safety precaution, this led us to be delayed, potentially missing our connection flight home from CDG. We were shuttled out of the plane, and taken back to the terminal where we were greeted and instructed by absolutely no one, displaying a shocking lack of empathy and support. We were all on our own, left to figure out how we would retrieve our bags, rebook flights, where to go, etc. Air France customer service dropped the ball here yet again. Finally, on our rebooked flight from BCN to CDG, our flight was 2 hours delayed due to an employee strike. The Air France employee speaking on the intercom was very clear to let us know that it was not Air France's fault, but rather the fault of a contractor. While this may be true, I still hold Air France accountable, and they could have handled the situation better by communication updates more frequently, and being better prepared by foreseeing the strike or having a contingency plan to minimize delays. Ultimately, we missed our connection flight out of CDG and had to stay in a mediocre hotel by the airport until our flight the next day.",negative,-0.752723,0,91,9.826499,6.990257

Air France will not help and does not care. They changed my gate information after issuing me the boarding pass. The new gate was 5 miles away from the original. Not just a few gates. Because they refused to give me my boarding pass once I was in their wheelchair assist program, I could not move on my own. On top of that, their staff kept us away from any monitors that would have shown the gate had changed. At NO POINT did they ever email, text or call us to let us know the new gate. Because their wheelchair assist was so slow, we showed up at the wrong gate with only 15 minutes left only to see an empty gate. They refused to hold the flight, even though it left 30 minutes late. So they weren't pressed for time, they just don't give a darn Out of the 12+ employees we dealt with, ONE helped. The rest were useless and lazy. They do not care about people at all. We were able to get a flight on Delta and make it home. One piece of luggage was delayed, but again, the luggage was being held by Air France and they don't care. Once it fell into the hands of Delta, it moved very quickly. On the flight getting to Europe, they gave us 4 ounces of water and that was all for a 10 hour flight. Then lost one piece of our luggage and lied to us about it. I have heard that the French are rude to Americans, but I assumed it was more urban myth; NOPE.

This review is for the Air France flight from Mexico City to Paris (CDG). First, the lounge experience that Air France leverages in Mexico City is subpar. The hard product (A350-900) is a very nice aircraft. No complaints with the seat, although the space for legs/feet for sleeping is a bit tight. Boarding was hectic in Mexico City. The flight attendants were friendly but nothing beyond the basics. The food was poor. The steak dish was horrible and bland (and cool). What really made this flight the worst, was the fact that Air France did not load any passenger bags (or pets) on this flight and did not tell the passengers until after arrival in Paris (at an empty baggage claim belt), and everyone had to enter a claim. Even though they knew this for the entire eleven hour flight. Apparently overloaded with cargo. Air France does not have bag tracking like United (for example) and the claim system was not updated promptly, so no indication of if/when bag would be delivered until a few hours before arrival at hotel the following evening (and I was leaving for another city in the morning!). Submitting claims for items purchased in slow and they don't except bank credit card receipt info (even though this shows date/location/store/item type, etc.). Had to be persistent with my responses and still not be compensated for the entire amount. Ability to contact Air France Customer Service is not easy to do.

The night before our flight, we got an email that we've been rebooked Chicago - Detroit - Paris, with the first leg being on Delta, the second leg being Air France in Detroit. We were annoyed because we paid for a nonstop ticket, but figured, at least we will still get in Paris, just a few hours after our original itinerary. Well, Delta to Detroit was delayed, and even with 20 of us that got rebooked on that Delta flight in Chicago trying to make the Paris connection, Air France did not wait for us in Detroit. We landed 36 minutes after the scheduled Paris departure. Now, we were stuck for a whole day in Detroit. We had horrible room accommodations, a shuttle that never showed up, and a day wasted on our short itinerary. To make matters worse, there was no one at Detroit airport from Air France (AF) to talk to all day so we tried working through an agent with Delta, but they could not see AF's international flights to help. Since we were now arriving in Paris a whole day later, we had a hotel night we had to pay for, museum tickets purchased in advance we could not use, and dinner reservations with a strict cancellation policy that charged us for not showing, despite our emails and pleas to not charge. Regardless, AF initial decision to bump 20 of us off the original nonstop flight in Chicago to Paris, caused us all to miss a whole day in Paris and cost us hundreds of dollars. I made a claim on Air France's website, which they replied to and said because the delay was less than 3 hours, no compensation would be rewarded. What are they even talking about? They clearly did not read our claim, so I called customer service, to which they could only reopen the claim but we cannot talk to anyone on the phone who handles the claims. I pleaded with them on two separate phone calls over two days to please let me talk to someone in claims or customer service or anyone who can help, to which they were very strict in saying there is no one for me to call, I just need to wait another week to hear back by email. Sure, the email's that they don't read and just send random responses to... all I can think of now is to get their attention by 1 star reviews.  What a horrible airline, with horrible policies.

Ticket purchased and confirmed. The next day, I received an email saying that they have switched aircraft and that my business class ticket would no longer be honored. I applied for a refund on Air France's non-user-friendly site, only to be told eight times that I didn't qualify, but twice that I did, only to later receive another notice saying I had filled the form out incorrectly. They just send back a decline and no further instructions. This has been going on since January. I've spent hours navigating their system. Long ago had to pay the credit card bill. This run around seems intentional. (I've even had French friends get involved and each time they hit a wall - not because I'm not entitled to a refund, which I clearly am, but because the online system either disconnects or ends up requesting information that I couldn't possibly have.)

On the positive side was the seat, perfectly private with sliding doors, great screen (selection of movies was ok but not overwhelming), of course the food and lovely wines were offered (but not proactively refilled). What really left me puzzled was how incredibly dirty the toilets were, already one hour into the flight. It was obvious no one really checked those toilets at any time. Furthermore the slowness in which the meal was served was disappointing. I am absolutely a fan of no rushed meals when a flight is 10+ hours and I love to take my time, but on this flight it took a full hour before we were served an aperitif and another hour for the meal to be served. At the end of the meal, we were already 3.5 hours into our flight with another seven to go and two hours before landing breakfast was served. Of course one may skip the breakfast and sleep a little longer, but it is hard if all cabin lights are being put on and there is action in the aisles.

Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Los Angeles via Paris,24-Feb,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," As an Airline Pilot myself, I understand the frustration that comes with passengers bringing a large quantity of baggage. I also understand the reason airlines prefer less bags and charge for additional weight/pieces. As I booked my parents standby to and from India, we didn't know in advance what airline they would be returning with (along with baggage restrictions) based on loads, until shortly before their return. The issue in this circumstance is that they were charged a total of $980 Canadian for 2 legs which we believe is an unreasonable amount. It appears that Air France has decided to just charge whatever they want to maximize profit with little regard for customer service and a positive experience for guests, especially ones travelling interline. Here is the experience from my parents point of view: Our trip with Air France started in Delhi, India where we were booked to fly to Paris and then to Vancouver on 29th Feb, 2024 Although the Staff at Indian Airport was very friendly, they did charge for extra suitcases for me and my wife, from Delhi to Vancouver at $120 CAD each. We each had a cabin briefcase and a personal item with us which was allowed without any issue. Interestingly my itinerary mentioned the flight departure at 1:45 AM as well as the online check-in, but the boarding pass indicated the time as 5:15 AM. I confirmed the flight time by calling Air France office in Delhi and confirmed the time as 5:15 AM which means that my connecting flight from Paris to Vancouver was no longer an option for me. The Paris-Vancouver flight was already departing by the time we reached Paris. Our son booked us to Vancouver via Los Angeles through Air France and then through WestJet from Los Angeles to Vancouver. The customer service at Paris Airport was the worst we have ever seen. No one was really ready to talk to you if you didn't speak French. While booking our luggage again at Paris to Los Angeles, we were asked to pay for 2nd suitcase again. We showed them the paper that we have already paid for the extra suitcase at Delhi Airport so they let us go. While going through the line for security check we were directed to another place and asked to weigh cabin case and personal bag together and were told that the weight is more than 12kg so we have to go back and book the cabin cases. We tried to explain that we are interline standby travelers and we are already connecting through an Air France flight where it was not an issue, but the person there was not ready to listen to us nor was he talking to us in English. He just kept pushing us to go and book our cabin bags. We had to go back and book our cabin briefcases and they charged us an excessive amount for that (240 Euro for each of the 2 cabin briefcases) We wanted to talk to someone and raise our concerns but no one was ready to talk to us or listen to us , probably because we were English speaking. As someone in the industry, I believe it would be hard to justify this amount. I look forward to your response and a chance for Air France to show they do value fairness and most importantly, customer service. After filing a complaint on their website, AF has been having us jump through hoops, utilizing delay tactics and refusal to allow communication with a supervisor.

The breakfast was much worse - I chose scrambled eggs and vegetables (in a hope that this would be basic enough for not being screwed up), and I was wrong. It was the worst breakfast I had in years. It tasted like the cheapest deep frozen breakfast from a discounted grocery. Aside the meals the other aspects of the soft product were passable, although very economical in any respect 每 the cushion was very small, the duvet was thin, the necessity bag very poorly stocked (as well as the WC), the snack buffet was very poor.

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Belgrade via Paris CDG,24-Mar,2,4,,,,1,1,no,2," I misconnected in CDG on a through ticket, purchased directly from Air France, on their website. The flight from Heathrow to Paris left on time and landed on time, but there was no one to operate the jetty at the gate which resulted in waiting another 40 mins on the aircraft. The Captain has not released the seatbelt sign, asked everyone to remain seated. Passengers with connections were getting anxious when we were sat on the aircraft for nearly as long as the duration of the flight. Once we were off, I started my long airside journey to the connecting flight. I ran through the terminal, waited for the connections bus, got on the bus, ran again, joined the queue for immigration, cleared immigration, then went directly to the front of the extremely long airside security queue and very politely asked if I can be fast tracked due to short connection, the security guard has agreed and allowed me through. I ran again and got to the gate, the aircraft was on stand but flight closed. There were another 17 PAX on this flight who missed the exact same connection behind me, they all arrived 30 mins after I got to the gate (they probably waited in security queue). Anyway, Air France refused meal vouchers, accommodation and any sort of rebooking assistance stating it was my fault I had missed the connection. The lady at the desk was unnecessarily rude and even said I had to buy a new ticket out of pocket at the cost of thousands of pounds, and my return journey would also be lost due to me being a noshow. Which didn`t make sense because I purchased a through ticket and a seat at the front, for the security of assistance in the event of disruption. Luckily, I know any decent airline will rebook you if you misconnect on a through ticket under such conditions. I went and purchased hotel for two nights, then went back to the airport and only after I had thrown a tantrum, together with the other 17 passengers who were still there two hours later arguing with staff, have they agreed to rebook us on the next flight, two days later in the evening. This was a horrible experience, unnecessarily stressful and a waste of everyone`s time. I have never dealt with such incompetent airline in my life. Three days later when I arrived at my destination, my luggage (you guessed it) was missing, despite me asking at check-in to make sure my bag would be loaded and receiving reassurance it would. It only arrived in the country a week later, less than 24 hrs before my scheduled return flight to the UK. But to make it worse, it could not be delivered to the address I was staying at, until two days later. If I wanted to have it on the same day, I had the option of driving 120 km to the airport myself and collecting it (which I did). I have filed a claim for the accommodation, meals and other expenses, they have refused to compensate for anything saying it was not their fault I misconnected and the wait for the jetty was not as I remember. It would make sense if the other passengers had all made it, but when 18 PAX misconnect it`s an indication it was not really possible to connect in the first place.

Our next flight was with Air France and the scheduled layover was 1hr 40mins. Massive lineup at the security checkpoint and were shunted to a severely understaffed overflow line. This overflow line had approx. 3 planes worth of passengers and they were being screened by 1 staff member using an old system 每 baggage and security trays were ferried by hand, no automation whatsoever. There was a free line next to us but that was exclusively for the 20 or so flight staff, all other passengers were ignored. It took 1hr and 10mins to get through the security checkpoint. There were arguments with passengers and staff, there were arguments with passengers and passengers as people were beginning to panic that they were about to miss their connecting flights. People were begging each other to be let through first, but all were in the same situation. Other lines to our right were moving quickly again but people were expressly forbidden by staff from transferring lines, nor did they offer to redirect.

Usually when you are forced to wait 12 hours because your airline cancels your flight, you are offered a minimum of 600 Euro compensation (this is even written on the Air France info site).

First of all, my cancelled flight 814 originated in Paris, which in the middle of the EU. Secondly, since when does an international airline that flies all over the world, compensate only those who fly witin the EU?

Poor catering on board, and on a nine-hour flight no one came to offer more drinks. I went to the back to fetch my own but found that the cabin crew had sealed off our compartment (limiting 16 rows to one toilet) with locked curtains, so they can be alone. Upon arrival, there was no wheelchair for me (and this happens all the time at CDG airport). I have an artificial leg and it is difficult for me to walk long distances, yet they have me walk up the boarding bridge to the lobby, then walk outside to catch their van, where it drops you off at another terminals and you have to walk up steps and then an elevator and then a longish walk to where they have their wheelchair staff. If you wish to fly with this group, choose KLM who are efficient, they have wheelchairs available when you arrive, take you to where you want to go. We flew to Bucharest, and there has never been a wheelchair waiting for me so I guess they do not do that there. My last three trips with AF/KLM have resulted in delayed suitcases of up to a week.

From start to finish, it was a series of mishaps and poor service that left me deeply stressed and unsatisfied. The outbound flight from Zurich was delayed by more than 30 minutes. This delay put us in a precarious situation, and we were forced to rush to catch our connecting flight at Paris CDG. The stress of almost missing our connection was certainly not the ideal way to begin a vacation. On the return journey, the problems persisted. The flight from Antananarivo to Paris CDG experienced another significant delay, causing us to miss our initial connection to Amsterdam. While we were rebooked on a later flight, the flight from Paris CDG to Amsterdam was delayed by 30 minutes. In an attempt to ensure we caught our connection in Amsterdam, we requested assistance from a flight attendant, only to be met with a disrespectful attitude and a dismissive response. Upon arriving in Zurich, the troubles continued as our luggage was nowhere to be found. Three of our bags were stuck in Amsterdam, and one in Paris CDG. We were left waiting for over 2 hours and 30 minutes for our luggage from Amsterdam to arrive in Zurich. This was particularly distressing because two of us had another flight scheduled for the following day and were uncertain whether our luggage would make it in time. As a result, we also missed our train connection from Zurich Airport to Thun. To top it all off, the in-flight meals provided by Air France were subpar at best. On the way to Antananarivo, the tomato salad had a rotten taste, and for a 10-hour flight, the meal options were shockingly limited. On the return journey, the meals were disappointing, with the second meal consisting of bread with some sauce, a cold mini croissant, a jam, and a yogurt. In summary, my experience with Air France on this trip was marred by delays, unhelpful staff, lost luggage, and inadequate in-flight meals.

Sitting in an Air France plane waiting during delayed boarding is torture given the NOISE that is played. Made by a 12 year old who knows three chords and got his hands on a synthesizer? Awful. Same mind numbing noise if you call AF. Flying in ※comfort§ Premium Economy for $3,660 RT is horrendously overpriced given the food and lack of attention. This was a fairly common Business Class fare. Except for a seat that is less uncomfortable than in economy and a pouch with a toothbrush etc., there is nothing to justify the price difference. Dinners were served, both ways, with a main dish in a rectangular box hidden in mashed potatoes. Return flight I chose duck. Sounds nice, right? More like pre- chewed something mixed with, or hidden underneath, mashed potatoes. On neither flight (to and from Paris) did anybody stop to ask if I would like another wine or more water. No drinks before dinner. Nothing to differentiate this ※Premium class§ from economy. Stewards steamed backwards with cart returning from economy without so much as looking sideways to quickly reach the sanctity of the galley between business class and the Premium Economy. You will not get any kind of service or attention that differentiates you from those in economy seats. It may be Air France＊s intention that there should be a difference, but I have on my three flights with AF this year seen none of it! None. While there are three or four bathrooms provided for business class in front of you, you will in the Premium section have longest walk to a bathroom of any passenger onboard. True! As I saw that many passengers (especially couples) are in their 60s and 70s this is another reason this Premium section does not warrant its price. The walk back through the economy section in the dark with pillows, blankets, and feet in the way is no fun. In reaching the very back of the plane there were three thin brown sandwiches in a large box waiting, together with a few chewable candies also in a large box and two stewardesses far less interested in engaging with a passenger than in talking among themselves. And it is especially here that KLM has a leg up on Air France. More often, but not always, do KLM personnel seem more friendly and engaging. With reference to my observations in the above, try KLM premium and compare for yourself. The Air France lounge is nice, but if given the opportunity, check out KLM＊s main lounge in Amsterdam. Also very nice. Conclusion, suffer economy for 8.5 to 10.5 hours and treat yourself (with the significant amount of money not wasted) to a nicer hotel and great and expensive meal upon arrival! And, on this particular flight, you will guaranteed be closer to bathroom if you book an economy seat! I personally prefer KLM, but when I need a flight on short notice it is usually AF that have tickets. For me, a Delta flight involves a stopover in the US, and is typically more expensive to boot.",negative,-0.525763,0,90,9.826499,6.990257

My wife and I recently flew with Air France in business class from Rabat to Manchester, with a connecting flight in Paris. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience that did not meet our expectations. On September 28, we boarded our flight from Rabat to Paris. The business class seats were barely an upgrade from economy, with limited recline and lacking amenities. The meal service was lacking - a small cold pasta salad and no appetizer or dessert. Upon arriving at CDG, there was no priority boarding or fast track security for business class passengers. We waited in a long queue for 35 minutes to board our connecting flight to Manchester. Again, the business class meal was mediocre - a small cold sandwich. On our return journey on October 1, we decided to fly economy class. Our flight from Manchester departed 15 minutes late. We were anxious about missing our connection in Paris due to the delay. The food was disappointing. Our flight landed in Paris 25 minutes late, giving us under 40 minutes to catch our connection to Rabat. We rushed through the airport and reached the gate just in time. However, upon landing in Rabat, we were informed that our checked luggage had been left behind in Paris. We had to return to the airport at 11:30pm when Air France sent the bags on a later flight. Overall, Air France's subpar seats, lack of amenities, mediocre food, and mismanaged baggage handling made this a terrible experience.

We were flying back to Johannesburg for our wedding and so wanted the experience to be slightly more special. Paid for an upgrade to business class at the airport for Paris to JHB. Firstly, we received better drinks service in economy coming back than going out in business class. After our boarding drink was poured and we were in the air I asked if I could get a drink, twice, to once be told they would be with me soon, and when we were still ignored my partner then asked for a whiskey and he was told you can wait till after dinner. I understand that if you have been drinking prior to your flight and appear intoxicated, then you are not going to be served. However, we had just gotten off of our flight from Edinburgh to Paris which we had not drunk on. This flight was delayed. We were unable to make use of any of the time in the airport lounge which had been included in our flight upgrade, so hadn't had anything to drink during our time through CDG either.  Also, this doesn't even include WiFi. Secondly, at check in we were unable to upgrade on our return as the flight was full. When I discussed the delay on our last flight and our missed opportunity to utilise the lounge included with our previous upgrade she shrugged and said she didn't know and I should ask someone else. The food was bad with no in flight options provided. Only veggie, with both main and side vegetables overcooked. There is zero quality for the economy class customer experience which is ironic considering they were the most expensive of the three airline options between us and our guests who either flew British Airways or Qatar. We paid (not including our upgrade) ?650 per adult return in comparison to ?600 for BA and ?500 for Qatar (all EDI to JHB). And again, despite being the most expensive, this included no checked baggage. Finally, my decision to never fly Sky Team again was cemented when I realised that I had not packed my toothpaste into my hand luggage on the economy fight back, so asked a stewardess if I could please have some to brush my teeth. Initially she told me they don't carry any toothpaste on board. When I didn't walk away she finally agreed that yes they do have toothpaste on board in the Business class flight bags but these are only for business class.

The seats are the same as economy with the middle seat vacant. On both legs the cabin crew were excellent and the food was tasty and well presented.

They only give two times something to eat.

I went to the next agent who was a little more helpful and told me to try the upgrade on the machine. (Even though there were no other customers to serve). I went to the self-operated check in machine and succeed to find the seats I wanted but it would not accept any credit card and redirected me to the counter.

Finally, I wanted their names which they completely refused to give, therefore I photographed them so that you can identify these rude agents and retrain their customer care service skills, or better yet give them a job that they do not have to deal with people.

I got off to check and saw my daughter's foot was stuck in this big gap as you see in the picture, by the metal piece stretching across the seat. This piece was visible and the cushion was falling off. I called the attendant and she quickly informed the chief steward who came and pulled the cushion away to seal it back to cover the metal piece.

We remain without fair compensation ($100 offered off a future flight). They made a significant change to my flight itinerary that I deem as an unfair or deceptive practice.

Furthermore, I purchased these tickets with the promise that we would be served the menu prepared by Chef Mashama Bailey (our co-chef through the James Beard Foundation), but I received horrid food that was still frozen, not her menu or as advertised. Additionally, the staff lied numerous times when questioned if the food was vegetarian, they said yes 每 only to come back and inform me that they served eggs with chicken. We are strict vegetarians, which caused harm. On the return flight from Paris to JFK, again, I purchased the beauty of an Air France flight with all of its luxury and had a significant change of my flight itinerary that I deem unfair or deceptive practice to a Delta Flight.

? Trip Verified ,,Business,Premium Economy,Munich to Ajaccio via Paris,23-Jul,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," I would like to express my dissatisfaction with my recent flight experience with Air France. Unfortunately, my trip was marked by a significant delay, inadequate accommodations, and disproportionate treatment regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. First and foremost, my flight experienced a 2-hour delay, which resulted in a missed connecting flight at CDG to AJA and disrupted my plans. The lack of effective communication and frequent updates on the flight status only exacerbated my frustration and discomfort throughout the waiting period. Furthermore, the accommodations provided by Air France were extremely disappointing. The hotel where I was accommodated was of inferior quality, with poor conditions and lack of air conditioning. The unbearable heat made my stay even more unsatisfactory and affected my rest before continuing with the journey. Lastly, I would like to mention the excessively strict attitude regarding the weight of my carry-on baggage. I was surprised by a severe reprimand from the airline staff due to just 700 grams over the limit in my carry-on bag, even though it was the same bag I boarded with in MUC. This disproportionate approach and disrespectful treatment left me extremely disappointed with the service provided. As a customer, I expected a comfortable and professional flight experience, but unfortunately, Air France did not meet my expectations. I request that you review your customer service policies with the aim of preventing other passengers from going through similar experiences in the future. As a result of this negative experience, I categorically state that I do not intend to fly with Air France again. I hope that this situation will be treated seriously, and appropriate measures will be taken to remedy the situation.",negative,-0.858831,0,90,9.826499,6.990257

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Paris,23-Jul,3,2,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  I have flown with Air France regularly because it is the only direct flight from South Africa to France where I study. I have always been surprised by how poor the food and service are on the route I take, but my last trip took Air France's utter disregard for passengers to a new level. After the plane was in Johannesburg for a whole day (available to be inspected and to make sure that everything on the plane was working) the flight got cancelled when we were already all boarded and ready to go when the pilot announced an issue with the air conditioning system. Even though I believe this was ridiculous already given all the time they had to check the plane, the worst was yet to come. The pilot gave a very unsympathetic announcement after we were sitting on the plane for two hours already that the flight is cancelled. Nothing else. The cabin crew advised us that the ground crew will assist us. Except that there were no ground crew when we got off the plane. One lady behind an obscure desk had no idea what was going on and a gent with her merely said to all the passengers that they should sort themselves out with accommodation, food and travel to the accommodation and then claim back. If all of this was already ridiculous, the worse was yet to come: trying to process a claim is a nightmare! Air France booked me on another flight 3 days later - without any correspondence with me. If I had taken this flight I would not have been able to graduate this year as I would've missed a key class in my studies. I urgently had to book another flight via Kenya to get to France in time for my classes. The whole process was so badly done that it proofed impossible to cancel the substitute flight without cancelling my return flight as well. There was no way of contacting anybody at Air France to assist in cancelling the replacement flight, but not cancel the return flight. No way to phone or e-mail. Air France doesn't even have an office area in Johannesburg where one can ask for assistance. The website is terrible and the AI used clearly doesn't cope with anything that is not stock standard. I am still struggling to try and process my claim. I have still not managed to connect with anybody at Air France that can assist to sort out the cancelling of the replacement flight. They claim you can connect with them on Messenger or Twitter, but don't be fooled, the AI chat bot doesn't work well and the supposed operators don't contact you as promised by the chat bot. Even the African Airlines are better than Air France. The customer service on Air France is terrible and it is clear they have no intent of actually providing a decent customer experience. Not on the plane, on the ground, on their website or in Charles de Gaulle airport.

I flew to Paris with my friend at the end of May and at the airport was informed that even though we paid and did everything correctly with the booking, for some reason tickets were not issued. They let us stay at the airport handing us a paper with contact for AF customer service, where after a longer wait they said they don＊t know how to deal with the problem so they have to think about it - I guess not realizing we are under a time pressure and could miss the flight - already in pressure and missed the time we wanted to stay at the airport lounge. After some time, they came up with a solution - to pay for the tickets again, yes, double charge us (in fact it was a triple charge) and said the previous hold would be released within 3 days, which did not happen within the period of time, but in the end it did. They also did not disrespect our selected seat we had chosen in the booking and wanted us to sit separately and also let us wait the line at the counter again, even though we had already waited before and was denied because of the technical issue on their side. After this horrible experience I contacted the airline explaining what a terrible experience we had with them, however we were not asking for any compensation or refund. They replied in quite a long time saying they issued a refund. I was surprised that they actually acknowledged how much they failed, but it was sadly not the thing - for some reason they thought I was asking for a refund because of the previous hold payment, which I was not. That means they did not even read my complaint properly and after another week I received an email my refund was denied. So not even the customer service employees care about the complaints, they probably don＊t even read it. This is the worst airline experience we have had so far and we have flown hundreds of flights combined. Thankfully there is a great competition in the European and world airlines market and it＊s easy to avoid flying with this terrible airline, which also means avoiding their sister KLM (and whole skyteam) which have allied with this terrible company.

If you go over even 2kg, as in my case, you cannot pay for extra weight. You have to pay 60 euros for hold baggage, and that means that you have to use the machine and then hold the line to load the hold baggage. (Ironically, since my bag was 10kg, less than 12kg, they asked me if I wanted to carry it to the check in). The line got very long, between the weighting line, the hold line, and the check in line, and I almost lost the boarding time. They could just let me pay for my 2 kg extra on the place, and it would have been a normal process. Next time I will try to avoid Air France.",negative,-0.74009,0,90,9.826499,6.990257

I could have been just a uncomfortable in Economy for several hundred dollars less. Food service was indistinguishable from economy. The seat was a bit wider but only reclined two inches. The space under the seat in front of me where I would have liked to stretch my knee-replacement legs was bisected by the legs supporting the seat. The foot rest and leg support were no help. Cabin service first round was a 6 ounce cup of Coke with no ice. Next cabin service came seven hours later. Same thing. So much for Premium Economy. The real treat came when we arrived on Monday May 29 in Naples, Italy. Our baggage failed to make the trip. So we stood at the baggage claim office in line for an hour to get what is called a ""Property Irregularity Report."" Meanwhile the driver who came to pick us up to drive us to Sorrento more than an hour away gave up on us and left. It took an international phone call to get him to return. We stayed in Sorrento until the morning of June 2 when we left for Rome. Our baggage finally arrived at the hotel 5 PM the night before we left. Four days without baggage. Air France did send an email with an apology for the inconvenience and admitted they were at fault for taking so long to return the bags.

? Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,New York JFK to Istanbul via Paris CDG,23-Jun,1,2,1,2,2,1,1,no,2," Would definitely never fly again with Air France or Delta. 1) I got my ticket from Delta and upgraded later to Premium Economy. The email I got from Delta says that my second checked luggage is free from JFK to IST (see attached photo). Air France ground crew at JFK said that it is free only for JFK to CDG and that I had to pay for CDG to IST although my bags were going directly to IST after checking in. Delta should have informed better as their email was grossly misleading. 2) My Premium Economy seat footrest was broken. It was basically not there so probably people who sat at this seat put their feet on the back pocket of the seat in-front of me so that was also broken (see attached photo). For an upgraded seat that I paid extra for it was uncomfortable and not worth it. A cabin crew member came later and told me they will send me a discount coupon of 45 euros on my next flight ticket with Air France and that is the only thing that they can do. 3) On both ways in CDG transfer while going to the US and coming back from the US and flying to IST there is a security control with long lines. Getting just out of one flight trying to catch another and you are again stuck with a security control. Overall I am very unhappy with my choices and would probably never fly again with Air France or Delta. And probably direct flight from Turkey to US would be better because the CDG is also not very entertaining and has very little options due to terminals/gates in terms of services, shops, food and lounges. These tickets are not cheap even if they are not upgraded and still the service and aircraft are not up to the standards.

I have always taken the view that there is always at least one thing wrong with any business seat but not on this occasion. It was extremely well designed with an excellent screen, solid table, privacy, ample storage spaces and the ability to locate switches and power points without searching too hard. We were offered a glass of champagne, juice or water before takeoff and given a very impressively comprehensive menu. I had pre-ordered the fish and it was incredibly tasty and excellently served by the cabin crew. I chose the delicious Chablis which seems to work well at altitude. It is an overnight flight and after the meal lights were dimmed. Although it was a flat bed seat I always believed that one sleeps better if it is at a slight angle 每 especially as aircraft never fly exactly horizontally. Despite only a blanket and pillow I had one of the most comfortable nights ever on an aircraft. I was awoken from breakfast and shown the omelette. This, I knew, never works that well but it was still tasty and accompanied by bread and fruit. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were absolutely excellent. Every request was answered and they were friendly, funny at times, very French (of course) and a credit to the airline.

US passport holders have an extra long line to weigh their baggage. The person weighing the baggage before this flight asked the passenger ahead of me in line to weigh her bags. When the bag was lower than the allowed weight, he asked her to put her shawl and jacket onto the scale. Then he shouted out ＆It is overweight, go and pay 100$ and check it in＊.  I went twice through the line, after removing and throwing away some of my luggage the first time. The second time, he put a red tag and asked me to pay excess baggage. There were some people around the corner, who were in conversation with this person weighing the bags in French. They asked me for cash and told me I had to pay there to get my baggage on the plane. I gave them cash, and a woman then took me to a long line and left me with some strangers saying they will take me in with the luggage. I soon realized this was the line for Business class and I was on the wrong line. By the time I went to the baggage counter to pay for extra luggage, it was too late to check-in my bag as the time for that had lapsed. So they made me throw away most of my luggage to make it a carry-on. The next flight was only two hours away.

Air France is in reality operated as a budget airline, because, unlike Airasia et al, they don't sell tasty food on board. So my advice is bring a substantial picnic because, after an early lunch, you will get nothing to eat for 9 hours.  The hapless staff have nothing to offer, other than a friendly giggle or a rude dismissive shrug. Bring your own music and movies, unless you like French stuff.

At check-in, I encountered the most grim looking row of agents I'd ever seen. I understand they had to stay at work longer due to the delayed flight, but that isn't my fault and I expect some smiles and basic courtesy when checking in, particularly on a costly business class ticket. After completing check-in, I noticed that my bag tag was completely illegible because the printer was running out of ink. I returned to the check-in counter where I approached an agent who appeared to be lead agent on duty that night. I asked him in French if my bag tag can please be reprinted as it was unreadable. He started yelling at me (in French), ""Who did you see when you checked in...go to that person"". I stopped all proceedings and firmly responded, ""Why are you speaking to me like that!?"". He then told me curtly that the bag had already been sent for loading onto the aircraft. I told him that I was well aware of how the baggage system works, but I had simply asked if my bag tag could be reprinted. He continued to give me rude responses, at which point I told him to go into the system and find my baggage tag number and write it legibly on my boarding pass. I then went to the Air France station manager's office and complained. Shameful treatment of a high revenue passenger. Flights were fine. Air France lounges in Paris should stock non-alcoholic beer.

The food quality was also poor. All take off and landing announcements from the cockpit were in French, not in English. The cabin crew manager talked to French passengers but never once spoke to me once during the flight.

Delta re-routed me ATL-CDG-LIS via partnership with Air France, and give me an upgrade to ""Business"" (due to the equivalent class was not available, but the ""Business"" still shows availability.) At the gate, Air France counter person insulted me: ""You have only paid $300 and want to fly Business""? I was trying to inquire if she was looking at my ATL to JFK portion of fare as I actually paid 3 times as much for my round trip. After she downgraded me and issued my ATL-CDG boarding pass, I requested the second portion (CDG-LIS), and told her I wanted to see a manager. She yelled at me: ""I am the manager!"" when I requested to see her badge (as she was wearing her badge front side inward), she replied: ""You cannot see my badge."" When I insisted, she said: ""I am deboarding you now!"" and she did knock on the keyboard to start the deboarding! At this time, a Delta counter person printed out CDG-LIS boarding pass for me. The nightmare continued in CDG when I was told I was not in Air France systems, so I cannot fly to LIS. However, the lady at CDG counter immediately escalated and resolved the situation. What a sharp contrast between the two employees from the same company! The Air France counter person in Atlanta (I still do not know her name) was rude and was all ""snappy"" and ""powerful"" when dealing with customers. The moment she said ""I am deboarding you now!"" I knew I was not talking to a normal person. While waiting to be boarded, a few other Delta passengers complained that she also charged them luggage fees - ignoring Delta policies. ""I am deboarding you now!"" was the last nail on the coffin, goodbye Air France! No one flies just for fun, we have destinations, schedules, people to meet and things to do.

At both stations it didn＊t take me more than 3 minutes with zero queuing time. At the same time queuing to normal check in desks would have taken good 20 minutes (also quite bearable if you arrive on time). My first flight was delayed by 1 hour. The delay was managed perfectly. Push notification and email on the mobile phone with new estimated boarding time and gate number, instant update of the boarding pass via app and proper announcement at the gate. Inflight information on missed and rescheduled connections was sufficient and clear. In the air they have managed to serve small snack with round if drinks (tea, coffee, soda, beer, wine). I purchased inflight internet access. The price was ok, speed was fine for browsing websites. If you need just messaging you can get a free plan for the whole duration of your flight.

Embraer fleet have no onboard internet access, but otherwise they are more comfortable with wider seats and more legroom. Service standard was identical to AF mainline with super friendly and professional crews. HOP flights use 2G terminal at CDG which is a small regional terminal located afar from the main area where all big terminals are. It requires a separate bus ride in addition to rail or bus city link, so mind it and allow extra 20 minutes if you＊re leaving from there.

As a consequence, I do not have clothes to work tomorrow, neither for my gym session. Additionally, I have my winter jacket in the missing baggage. Being in Prague and being in winter, I can not go anywhere without it. For this reason, I am going to buy at least some business clothes and gym clothes so I can make it through the day tomorrow. Air France does not want to compensate for any of the costs involved on this as they say I have a permanent, and not a temporary address. I do not care what the policy say, this is going to cost me money and make me waste time. Being such a well known company, I trusted Air France. The whole experience of missing a baggage starts on the airport, where you are waiting for longer as your bags do not come. Then filling all the paperwork on the baggage claim desk. Afterwards, having to call the company and waiting for customer service to answer so you can get to follow up your case with disappointment to hear that it is not going to make it on the right time.

So, in the end, I have received no compensation I was told I would receive and no follow-up was even considered. Now, I will turn to contacting their customer service via social media to see if I shall get a different result. Unfortunately, according to the email, it was one representative navigating my claim this entire time with no option to speak to the person directly in charge of discharging financial compensation.

Air France themselves have the same problem - the last time I flew, my bag also missed the connection, and arrived in London three hours after me. That's when things really went downhill. Despite the fact that I live only two hours drive from Heathrow, it took Air France 3 days to ship my bag to me. I can order something on Amazon by midday and have it delivered the same day, but Air France takes 3 days to ship to an address two hours drive away. The final cherry on the cake: arrogant, indifferent customer service. When I called to complain about all of this and asked for a manager, the operator initially refused to let me talk to a manager, saying this was just about a bag. When I insisted, he said all of the managers were in a meeting, but he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available!

I did not even take a shower in case the driver came with my bag at exactly that time. This was a blatant lie by the driver. I then insisted that they make a delivery and I now have another two interval I need to block in the evening. In the best case scenario, I will have spent my entire day waiting at home for a bag.

From NY to Paris we we golden. Smooth as silk. We took off he ate and slept. We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed. Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began. He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off. Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon). He was rejecting all toys and foods.

It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them. It was an out of body experience. Our son has never been so miserable. I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable. Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire. The only bright spot was the flight crew. Which is the reason for the review. I have to give credit where credit is due. They were simply amazing. Very empathetic and supportive. Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasn't just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available. BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers? I found that interesting and don't know why. Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days. My salute to the air crew that day.

On the return flight our bags were spot checked and found to be overweight so we had to get out of the line for passport control, check the bags, then get back into the passport line. This was frustrating, but since we had left a ridiculous amount of time to make the flight we didn't actually have a problem. In addition, the employees marshaling the passport lines were very heads-up and were moving people to fill gaps in the line. They also appeared responsive to pleas about flights departing soon, including those in English. We were of course pretty worried about whether our bags would vaporize on the way to JFK but fortunately everything showed up and was undamaged. All of this means we were very fortunate, since we were flying midsummer when all of the horror stories were happening and  we didn't have to deal with AF ground service, which in our experience has never been terrible but never better than OK, either.  The in flight experience was fine, although AF is one airline where it pays to fly Premium Economy. We flew regular Economy because of the size of our group, and the service was less. Cabin staff very pleasant as usual but not very visible apart from meal service. Much more attentive the further forward you go, which is not a very passenger-centric strategy. The aircraft wasn't new but had been refreshed. IFE worked and had lots of options. Outbound flight took off late but landed almost on time, return flight was on time. In Premium Economy or Business Class Air France an excellent airline, but in Economy it's a little disappointing. AF could learn a lot from Delta, which provides pretty good service throughout the cabin, or even from United, which is mediocre front to back. Most of my international travel is to France, and most of that is on Air France. This is unlikely to change.

My wife and I paid for direct roundtrip flights from Vancouver (YVR) to Paris (CDG) for our honeymoon trip, and that's where our first experience (and probably last) with Air France goes horrible. To start, our direct return flight home to Vancouver got cancelled, and they tried to put us on a connecting flight a day earlier, which obviously does not work with our travel plans as we are not even in Paris that 1 day earlier. Secondly, our seat selections for both our outbound and return flights that we made suddenly disappeared and my wife and I got separated to seats that were not together. We had booked our flights way earlier and there were lots of seat options at the time, but because they for whatever reason lost our seats, there were no good options left and my wife and I were stuck with choosing the only remaining option left for 2 seats together that were terrible, because all the seat selections had been taken now. I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France? To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months. In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed. I've tried multiple channels to reach ANYONE who can help, but each time I was told there is nobody who can help you, sir.

That seemed strange to me, so I asked the stewardess in English if that was the right thing to do and she only said that the hold was full and the suitcase was loaded in the back. That struck me as odd, too, but that could be the case, I thought to myself and sat down again. More suitcases arrived, still being loaded into the same hold (so apparently the hold wasn't full after all). Meanwhile, my suitcase was still lying on the back of the car. At some point no more suitcases came and the loading belt was retracted. So I went to the stewardess again and told her that my suitcase is still on the back of this car and that the luggage strap is now being removed. After a short discussion, she fetched the pilot, who left the plane with my suitcase badge. I looked out the window and unfortunately the car on which my suitcase was lying was gone now too. After a minute or two the pilot came back and just said don't worry my suitcase will be on board. Then I just said if he was sure, because the last time I checked, my suitcase was still on the car and the luggage strap was retracted. The stewardess then answered me something in French, I just said that unfortunately I don't speak French and that's why I had spoken to her in English beforehand, she answered in French again. I sat down again and during the pushback I saw all the trolleys lined up and of course my suitcase was still on one of these trolleys.  My suitcase arrived in D邦sseldorf the next evening, one of the four wheels had broken off, a wheel bearing had broken out, one of the two locks had broken and the suitcase was so warped that it could no longer be closed. A Rimowa aluminum case that has endured a lot for 8 years. The destruction of the suitcase, of course has more to do with Paris Airport, but the whole thing would probably not have happened like this if my suitcase had been loaded, because as the next to the baggage carousel at the airfield, all 4 wheels were still attached.

I reached out to customer service using the 800 237 2747 which is not even located in France (it is a call center in India) who have informed me several times, all I needed to do was submit an online claim for hotel accommodation on our 10 hour overnight layover. When I submit the online claim they tell me to call back the 800 number who then informed me I need to reach out through Facebook messenger. On that communication I was informed I should ask for accommodation in person when I get to Paris. Upon our arrival in Paris at 11.40pm the customer service informed us they will not be providing us with hotel accommodation since we bought the ticket knowing there was a layover. They only provide accommodation if your flight is canceled or delayed. This did not make sense because all of their flights from Greece to Washington, D.C. had layovers at the time of our booking. This was completely new information for us since we have been communicating with their customer service for over three weeks before our travel which could have made our own hotel booking if they didn't lead us to believe they will provide one for us. Because we arrived around midnight there was no hotel available for us during our layover and we had to sleep at the airport. We are absolutely disappointed with how they handled the conversation at their customer service office in Paris where we were told, ※sorry you received misinformation but since our call center is not in France we cannot control what information they give.§ This is the first airline we know of that have no control over their customer service. We will never use this airline and I advise anyone who might have similar flying scenario to make your own accommodation regardless of what the customer service tells you.

Luckily they noticed it and firmly directed the passenger back to the queue. This could have been an administrative if not security problem. On board the service was efficient and pleasant. We were delighted to find that AF served a decent snack on short-haul flights (a sandwich plus a choice of alcoholic or soft drinks). Probably because of the slow boarding process at Heathrow our first leg to CDG operated 25 minutes late, resulting in us having to sprint up and down staircases at CDG to catch our onward flight to Lisbon.

First, we were overcharged for our bags going from Paris to Nice. When we arrived the kiosks charged us $70, but it was only supposed to be $45. I tried to ask multiple Air France representatives for help and everyone ignored us and kept walking by. Since no one would help, we paid the $70 to get out of there. But one of our bag tags was missing. We paid for 3 $70 tags but we only received 2 printed. So we had to go get in line for a representative to help us. The line was long and moving slow. Once we got to the front, the Ai France representative confirmed that we were not supposed to be charged $70/bag we were only supposed to pay $45/bag. But he said he couldn＊t issue a refund and we would have to file a claim which we are doing now. But he was trying to make us pay $45 again for the missing bag tag. He printed the tag for us and we put it on our bag, but after he realized I wasn＊t going to pay the $45, since I already paid $70 for it, he ripped the tag off my bag.  I requested a manager and the manager told him he was wrong, and reprinted us a tag and told us to get in line to drop off our bags. This drop off line was so long and there was only 1 person at the front desk with 10+ stations. Finally when we got to the front, the third bag tag wouldn＊t scan, so again we needed assistance which took pulling teeth to get. We waited and no one would help. Finally a manager saw us and took us to the side station, reprinted yet another tag and checked the bag for us and sent us to security to go to our gate.

Duration of the first flight is 15 hours. Although I was worried for this very long trip, time passed quickly aboard. I didn't watch any movies, but I peeked at the selection and it was very large and there were films that came out recently or great classics. Super positive note the wifi is free for everyone just to send light messages (no audio, no photos) but if you pay you can get it faster! The seats were very uncomfortable for me, my seat was dirty, crumbs on the seat and food stains on the table. In times of covid this is very serious for me. The Air France site is difficult to handle. I wanted to change my flight, I did all the steps and then it gave me ERROR, and when I returned to the original booking page they canceled the seats I had purchased in advance ... luckily I contacted the company via messenger and they put everything back to normal! In the end I discovered that to change the flight you have to call a number. But be prepared, if you call the number from Japan you will have to wait 30/40 minutes !!

However, all 5 of our bags were missing when we got home. It has been 5 days and countless phone calls and nothing has been done to tell us where our bags are or when to expect them. Items include stroller, car seat, and breast pump so my wife can provide milk to feed our son. All of these items had to be replaced because we cannot wait in limbo for them.

Unnecessarily rude flight staff. Stay away upon arrival to the airport, we were told that our cabin bags had to go in the hold because the flight was at (or near) maximum capacity. When our bags came out of the hold, my laptop display was broken. I work remotely and so had to replace this instantly, and getting in contact with Air France has been an absolute nightmare. Firstly, I called their customer service lines several times. Every time is the same result - a string of employees with no understanding of what I'm saying, who direct me back and fourth across various different departments, often knowingly directing me to the wrong department just to get me to shut up. I submitted a claim to Air France directly 3 weeks ago and have still received no response. I've updated the claim several times, they are just ignoring me. Furthermore, on our outbound flight, there was sick on the seat. This being a 13 hour flight, we understandably asked a member of the team to move seats. She then came back with tissues and began wiping the seat. When my girlfriend stated that we didn't want it cleaned but rather wanted to move seats (the mess was really bad and smelt absolutely vile), the staff member very rudely and patronisingly said 'one minute' and then continued to rub the crime scene with her clearly inadequate bits of tissue. we eventually got her to agree to move our seat. We went and sat at the front where she told us to. A man comes over, head of the on-board team, and starts having a go at us for being in the wrong seat. We tried to tell him 'another staff member moved us here' but he sadly went on to repeatedly tell us to move for about 5 minutes, before eventually realising what we are saying, apologising, and leaving us in peace in our new seats. On our inbound flight, we did not receive the veggie meals we asked for. The lady just said 'No' repeatedly in again, an unnecessarily patronising tone, and continuously denied that we had requested vegetarian meals. She offered us meat meals instead. After we made it very clear that we were unhappy, we were given an armful of bread rolls and cheese to resolve the issue, as we'll as an extra desert and one pasta dish. This may have been the best they could do at the time, but was not exactly sufficient for a 13 hour flight. Furthermore, we've checked our booking and it clearly shows that we asked for vegetarian meals. This was just one return booking, and they did so many things wrong.

They stated my carry on or purse needed to be paid for and put through baggage or I needed to remove items and throw them out. I had to go all the way back and pay for my carry on luggage that did not have a lock and had valuable items in it to be put through with baggage.

? Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-300ER,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Paris to Miami,21-Nov,3,4,3,5,5,5,4,yes,8,"  First medium-haul experience with Air France. This is part of a connecting flight from LHR-MIA via CDG. Check-in at LHR was swift, thanks to Sky Priority (customers flying Premium Economy get Sky Priority access). Due to COVID, check-in meant extra checks and formalities during check-in. All my documents were verified in less than 20 minutes. I received my onward boarding pass to MIA. This is my first medium-haul trip with Air France. The equipment used on this flight was a 10 year old Boeing 777-300ER. I was among the first passengers to board this full and busy flight. The cabin crew upon boarding were very friendly and warm. The plane was in an immaculate condition and was kept very clean. We left 45 minutes behind schedule due to technicalities and the crew gave regular updates. After take off, the crew sprung into action. They distributed a sanitary kit which consisted of a mask, alcohol surface wipes and hand sanitiser. We were told that unfortunately, amenity kits were not loaded on this flight and the crew were very apologetic. The meal service was swift but was done with care. Lunch served was good in quality but lacking in quantity which is the only downside. The crew were also very proactive with the drinks service. After the main meal service, cabin lights were switched off and were invited to help ourselves to the self-help snack bar which was adequately stocked with drinks and snacks. The second meal service came in a rather chic paper bag which consisted of a warm sandwich, a bread roll, a muffin, a chocolate bar, orange juice and a yoghurt drink. In addition, drinks were served again. For a 9 hour flight, the quality of the meals served was good but lacking in quantity. Air France could perhaps increase their portions when it comes to Premium Economy dining. The seat on this aircraft is Air France's fixed shell seat which mean that rather than reclining, the seat slides forwards so that it does not intrude your personal space. The seat was wide with good cushion padding. The pillow and blanket also appeared to be off higher quality compared to other airlines I've flown with in Premium Economy. The seat also came with a leg rest which was a very good addition. Now, there are a lot of negative reviews of this product but I would say that this seat is adequately comfortable for a TransAtlantic flight. My back did get a little sore from the seat sliding forward but I used the pillow to add some padding. I requested for an extra pillow and was given one without hesitancy. As we were flying during COVID, cabin crew and passenger interaction was very minimal to keep each other safe. However, I noted that the crew were very responsive in meeting the needs of the passengers from what I observed. IFE content was outstanding. There were more than enough new Holywood films available and a couple of French, Western, Asian and Bollywood films. In addition, the IFE offering also had plenty of radio stations and Album selections. In addition, the plan is equipped with an external camera. Air France is nowhere near a perfect carrier as there are things that Air France could do better in terms of its Premium Economy service which in my opinion would be: increasing portion sizes of meals and offering a bar service as only red wine was offered during the drinks service. Overall, Air France is a great alternative to fly across the Atlantic!",positive,0.584978,1,88,9.076123,-7.247081

While frustrating, this sometimes can't be helped, especially with COVID and the winter weather. However, my flights were cancelled a total of three times, costing me $450 in COVID test fees, as well as $300 in hotel costs to stay near the airport due to the last minute cancellations and rebookings. Very poor communication from staff to passengers about what was happening with flights - we were sat for over an hour after the initial departure time waiting to hear what was happening, only to be repeatedly told we would be boarding ""soon"", followed by the surprise news that our flight was cancelled. It's incredibly frustrating to have to relay the messages back to my manager back home, and pray the next flight I book won't be cancelled. I understand that the current global situation has placed pressured on airlines, and I wouldn't be leaving a bad review over one cancelled flight. But to be told the flights will ""definitely"" be going ahead, and to be cancelled again and again, is frustrating and unprofessional for everyone involved. It also seems that very few other flights are having this happen to them, and even when I've flown during other points of the pandemic, I've never faced such poor communication and repeated cancellations. Staff were polite, but misinformation was still given, and everything felt poorly organised and poorly communicated to the staff left to answer questions to the stranded passengers.

I tried multiple times to reach the airline for help and the line hung up automatically after playing a message about the wait time. I would have gladly waited to speak with anyone. Multiple online searches with this airline showed no other flights available to my destination so I had to book a new reservation with a different carrier at more than double the cost ($1400 vs my original $600!). I did receive a full refund of my original purchase price but the airline would not take responsibility for the fact that their poor communication forced me to spend double+ on this trip than was budgeted and it was not possible to cancel and reschedule this trip. ,negative,-0.851255,1,88,9.076123,-7.247081

Catering was also a bit on a low-side: salad was tasty, although no hot food on a 3.5 hour flight, only one kind of tea, not even basic things like lemon is given. CDG is a very confusing airport by its layout, although there were many staff members navigating passengers,  making the transfer efficient. A CDG - LHR leg was uneventful, a typical 1-hour intra-European hop, however, with extremely uncomfortable business class seats. A foie gras as a snack was a very nice touch. All in all, a decent experience for an EU airline. Air France nowadays seems to be a nice option to accrue a good bunch of miles subject to an attractive fare and if they schedule a widebody on a Moscow flight. However, in all other respects, I would strongly prefer KLM as a peer transit airline: they fly from LCY, their Schiphol hub is much much better for transit, the narrowbody seats are way more comfortable and staff generally better.

I found the seat weird with an oddly positioned aisle side armrest. In the flat position, you feel like you are in a coffin. Food was utterly unremarkable - a pity given that it is a carrier from France which has such wonderful food. The selection of movies was large, but didn't have much of interest. I asked for a second cup of chamomile tea and was told they had run out .. seriously? i have brought my own tea bags if I knew they'd run out of it in business class.

The good experience was really down to a fabulous crew. Very professional and charming. The food & beverages was really good. It seems like out of CDG the on board experience has really picked up since I last flew AF out of CDG just prior to covid. Great selections and quality along with awesome presentation. The 787 is really great for long haul. Good seats, good entertainment, quiet cabin and good amenities. Arrived in DTW approx 45 mins ahead of schedule. The bad part is the ground service. I'm sure the rush to travel now restrictions are being eased does not help, but at both LIS and CDG the boarding process is pandemonium. No-one seems to understand zoned boarding, so you literally have to fight your way through throngs of people to board at your allotted time. The paperwork for Covid related info at CDG was never addressed over the PA, but there was a table (without pens) and some papers that should be filled out, but no-one working the gate said anything until you were scanning your BP with the gate agent, so many people would then retreat back to the table and back through the line of passengers waiting to board. To cap all this, a PAX traveling with her 7 YO son was denied boarding and caused a major commotion for about 20 mins as she had been misinformed about her sons test. OK maybe this isn't on Air France, but from what she screamed to the security agents would suggest she had been given the wrong info by Air France the previous day when she was denied boarding because she didn't have the correct test to travel to USA. After getting the required test she arrived at the gate of my flight only to be denied because her son had not been tested. I know this is 100% on the passenger, but she had been misinformed about this requirement by AF the previous day in regards to her son, so certainly have some sympathy for her. Overall it added enormously to the chaos and CDG is not best equipped to have an entire widebody's load of PAX jostling and not observing any kind of distancing. Apart from the poor ground service the only negative thing while in the air was the terrible wifi.

Air France has not offered me any sort of assistance, no meal vouchers, no courtesy call, no hotel accommodation, no transfer voucher or any compensation whatsoever. When I arrived at my final destination (more than two days later) I found out that my suitcase was also lost by the airline. No compensation for that either, no apologies from the airline. Just saying nothing is their fault. Why did I misconnect? After arriving on stand, the Captain told us that there was no ground staff available to operate the jetbridge. So we had to wait. Only one dispatcher for so many flights - the Captain＊s words. We were seated on the aircraft for about 45 minutes. Naturally a lot of people started to panic and complain while still on board, heavy arguments started between crew and passengers regarding who should be re-seated, with swear words flying around. After disembarkation a long run started. Be aware, if you are planning to connect at CDG. Most of the airport is closed/unused. Transfer signs are covered with A4 sheets with handwritten ※closed§ notes and arrows on them. Staff are blocking routes and re-directing passengers. Only two immigration officers at transfer area, processing several hundred passengers. Only a few security lines open at transfer area, for a huge crowd of people. Buses between terminals run every half an hour and I am not exaggerating. Air France knows you can＊t connect in such a short time, because it＊s simply impossible. They will still sell you a ticket. Because they don＊t care if you misconnect. Please only try to connect at CDG if you have at least 3 hrs to connect! And the worst of all, after misconnecting, together with approximately 40 other passengers, we went back to the ticket desk to seek assistance. We were immediately told there was no compensation, no assistance and no rebooking. Without even checking our tickets. Several passengers were immediately reduced to tears. I have never in my life encountered such rude, unhelpful and arrogant personnel. If you are unfortunate enough and must travel at these uncertain times due to an emergency, please please avoid Air France and CDG airport, or if you can＊t, make sure you have at least an extra EUR 500 in your pocket to cover hotel expenses for yourself. And please check what alternatives you have in case you misconnect. Also, having a through ticket, purchased directly from Air France doesn＊t really help either if you misconnect, they will tell you it＊s not their fault you misconnected, so they are not obligated to look after you.

However it is difficult to be unimpressed by the A350. Air France's set up is attractive, this aircraft looked very new indeed and was very nicely presented. New economy seats are all uncomfortable in my experience and this was no exception. I had 3 seats to myself so I was very comfortable but had I been in a full plane this would have been a long 11 hours indeed. The seat is pretty hard, the legroom is not bad for the class, one of the benefits of hard seats is their shape seems to generate a bit more space for the person behind. Entertainment system is good but not brilliant like Emirates system. I think you need to download an app before flying to access their wifi. The food was really disappointing. Pasta in a tomato sauce with a grain salad. I know Air France has meals available for purchase prior to flying, it would seem they are trying to push people in that direction as the free option was pretty poor. Staff we generally good, one steward hassled me for not wearing a mask at a time I was drinking water, really annoying but generally the staff were nice. Flying conditions were grim but the A350 skipped above the trouble at 40000 feet, it was bouncy but less modern aircraft would have been all over the place.

I could also see that the amount had been reserved on my MasterCard. The e-mail with the confirmation did not include a lot of information other than a link to the details of my trip online. By accessing the link I could see that everything was in order. The next day, when my travel was supposed to take place, I checked the link once more, but this time nothing showed up. I just got a blank internet site. By contacting the airline, they informed me that my booking was cancelled by them. I had received no information about this from the airline. The given reason was that it was apparently not possible to order a trip from Egypt with Air France online within the last 72 hours before departure. Nothing on their website had indicated this as far as I could see and my booking had through. The man I spoke to had no solution to this problem, but told me I had to personally show up at the airport and order a flight from Air France and pay in cash. I told him I needed a booking to make sure I got a seat, given the coronavirus situation. He made a new booking in my name and told me I had to pay for the tickets at the airport before 22:00 p.m. I went to the airport very early to make sure I would get my ticket in good time, but at the airport there were no one from Air France. By calling them I got information that my second booking also had been cancelled (again with no warning from the airline) and that they wouldn't have personel on the airport until three hours before the flight, meaning not before 22:50 hours p.m. The guy I spoke to this time said he would make a new booking for me, but he could not guarantee that this new booking would also not be cancelled and he could give no guarantee for availability. This was ""not in their policy"", so he could basically do nothing. I asked him if it was in their policy to accept two bookings from a customer, reserve money on their credit card and then cancel the booking twice without giving any information or heads-up to their customer. A question for which their representative had no answer.  I was not willing to take anymore chances of delaying my booking any further, so I booked another trip with Emirates without any issues at all. Now, four days later, on Tuesday 17th march, the amount is still reserved on my MasterCard.

The arriving plane was delayed inbound due to mechanical problems and then had further mechanical problems resulting in more delays leaving Detroit. Gate agents did a reasonable job of keeping everyone informed. I had read poor reviews of the Premium Economy seating and was still surprised to discover how uncomfortable the seats were. They do not really recline but slide forward and finding a comfortable seating position was difficult. My wife did better since she is shorter but at almost 6ft I could not get comfortable in the seats at all. Footrest was basically useless. I managed to make the seat a bit more bearable by sitting on the folded blanket and the pillow provided on the seat. The ""inspired gourmet meal"" per the AF website was the same as regular economy and not that inspiring. The appetizer ""inspired by the Business Class menu"" was a meat pate that really didn't pair well with a vegetarian meal. The ""chilled oshibori towel"" was missing, replaced by a wet wipe tossed on the tray table. Service was minimal and indifferent with the crew disappearing right after the meal was served - there were no water runs or crew service for the majority of the flight. In general, the flight experience reflects what seems to become the norm. However, the Premium Economy hype on the Air France website raises unrealistic expectations. This flight was a code share with Delta and the Delta service on the Delta return flight was significantly better.

We flew business class from Atlanta to CDG, then had an internal France flight to Marseille. We returned on a flight from Lyon to CDG, then business class from CDG to Atlanta. Business class was not offered on the internal France flights. Business class is allowed 2 checked bags. This wasn't a problem on the outbound trip. On our return we had to pay excess baggage fees because the first leg of our flight was economy and we were only allowed 1 bag each. Multiple calls to AF customer service indicates this is their policy. The originating leg dictates the baggage allowance. So be aware even if you fly business class if one of your legs doesn't offer that level, you don't get the full benefits of business class.",negative,-0.410012,0,86,9.716435,5.638355

It was my first time flying with Air France and the first impression I got after being boarded was the yellowed up plastic around the old screen panel on the back of the seats.  The in-flight entertainment on the A380 was disastrous. To give the impression that they have more movies to offer, a movie with 4 languages would be displayed as 4 movies; touch screen was extremely non-touch-sensitive; screen pivot was broken. The saving grace was that I managed to get some sleep in the air. Air France booked a 75 min transfer for us, and thanks to landing 20 minutes early, we managed to board on time for our connecting to Rome. On our trip back at Rome, ground staff assistance was non-existent, the pre-checked-in queue for bag drop was slower than the normal check-in+bag-drop queue. A queue of 4 parties spent almost an hour moving down the line, I was only moved to the front during last call for check-in...I arrived 2 hours before scheduled departure. Connection in Paris CDG was horrendous, the moment we landed, we had to rush out of the plane, rush to a shuttle to take us to the transit area. It was the longest queue I have seen at an airport passport control. We snuck into a priority queue and went to the front. Alas, after clearance, we had to wait for a shuttle to get to another terminal. At this point, we were almost sure we would miss the flight. Disembarking the shuttle bus, we rushed to the terminal lobby and luckily managed to find our way to our boarding gate at last call. We were so glad Air France booked us on China Eastern.

Boarding to the upper deck is smooth for business class. The first impression is tainted by dirty seat (s. photo) with stains and crumbs on it. The seat is not a full-flat with limited recline and quite cramped. Service during the flight was not impressive with FA seemed to be overwhelmed. I was not able to assess IFE since remote control was broken and to press the touch screen all the time was annoying. Food tasted amazingly bland: appetizers including bread seemed to be served directly from the fridge with poor presentation (s. photo). The main course (I had zucchini canneloni) was OK. Fresh fruits for dessert were mashy. Enigmatic was the deck in front of the cabin (s. photo) - the bench imitation was of no use since you slide down when trying to sit on it. Another surprise - the lack of wi-fi which nowadays is provided on most even smaller planes.

This was one of the many Air France-operated flights that are booked and managed through Delta, and this made the few gate changes and delays we experienced on both legs of the trip more complicated. However, the in-flight experience was pleasant and the aircraft was nice. I prefer Airbuses whenever I can fly them, and Air France does a good job of keeping seat pitch in theirs roomy for economy passengers. At the advice of some other reviewers, we paid the small and reasonable fee each way to ""upgrade"" to the upper deck of the cabin, which is a much more intimate space with a better attendant-to-passenger ratio. The pitch was also about 3' more generous, and the upstairs was a more quiet, warm space than any I've flown internationally. Meals came noticeably quicker in the upper deck, even considering that we were some of the last people upstairs to be served, and I did not run into a waiting line for the restroom once on either leg of the trip. I did not book in time to get an upper deck window seat, but I'd heard about the added bonus of a storage container that these passengers got included in the same ticket price I paid. I was in the middle but had a woman to my left without someone next to her, and I saw her window seat storage bin first-hand. It was big and literally fit all of her odds-and-ends. It was awesome and another reason to book this seat if you can. Well worth the money. Crew was friendly, food was okay but warm and well-portioned, and the in-flight entertainment was good. The only real negatives were the complications of booking Air France through Delta, which I feel created more delays and gate changes than would have occurred if I'd booked direct.

This flight wasn＊t our first choice, as we were originally booked on a Air Mauritius flight, but were rebooked to this Air France flight because of the cancellation of the Air Mauritius flight (we knew this 2,5 months before departure). When we checked in online we were assigned two aisle seats on row 22. When we later checked our seats in the Air France app again we found out we were assigned different seats; row 20 and 54! The reason of this was a equipment change; Air France was operating a less dense 777-300ER with a lot less Economy class seats. During check in we adressed the seat issue and lucky we got new seats; 47A and B. When we sat down we felt extremely cramped; the seats were very uncomfortable with terrible leg room and appealing shoulder space. Air France is operating the 777 in a 3x4x3 configuration, and  this cramped configuration is used with an increasing amount of airlines. The PTVs were of good quality with decent content; movies, series, music, games, interactive map and a front camera. The cabin crew was very professional, proactive and polite. Both meals (dinner and breakfast) were of a good quality, but a bit small. Last but not least, the temperature on board was extremely hot during the first few hours. We addressed this to the crew and they acknowledge, but couldn＊t do anything about it as the system was not reacting properly. To sum up; this was my first and most definitely last experience on board of an Air France 777-300ER. The service was fine but the seat discomfort made it one of my most uncomfortable flights ever. I would certainly fly Air France again (this was my fifth flight with them), but only if it isn＊t a Boeing 777!",negative,-0.422011,0,86,9.716435,5.638355

I had booked my initial travel on business class on Polish Airlines from Los Angeles to Tblisi since it was the shortest flight in the duration of 18.5 total. It was on May 3th, 2019. By the time I got to Warsaw and waited for 6 hours that was expected, then there were delays, then unexpectedly they cancelled the flight at the last moment and informed us that we needed to wait for another 24 hours to fly to Tbilisi. They did provide a hotel. However, I had a family waiting for me for a celebration and I needed to get to Tbilisi as soon as possible. So, I arranged an arduous fight back to Paris, then to Tbilisi that saved more time. My overall flight lasted 37 hours and included lots of schlepping, but I have to mention the detour through Air France that provided light and amazing service through this ordeal. The flight to Paris included this delightful female (unfortunately I didn＊t get her name) flight attendant that made things so pleasant. From Paris to Tblisi, on the last exhausting leg, I encountered a flight attendant named Patrick, who made my day pleasant. I can not undermine how he changed my horrific flight experience to quite pleasant. He was authentic, didn＊t try too hard. light attendants have a difficult job of dealing with stressed public.

Our flight back on the A380 was significantly less enjoyable. Boarding was reasonably efficient, but I was again the victim of additional security checks at the gate (Happened my last trip in Taiwan as well) which meant I didn't get to board with my friend, and was among the last people on the aircraft. Luckily I didn't have any issues finding overhead space once finally onboard. Once on the plane I was shocked at how dated and worn everything appeared. Seat covers were ill fitting and faded, cabin lighting was dull, the IFE system was among the oldest and in quite poor condition, the remote was filthy, and the bathroom was something Air France should be ashamed of. I can only imagine that since they're already looking to retire half their fleet of 10 A380's they're avoiding putting absolutely any money into them. I've included photos of the more glaring discrepancies. The first meal service occured in the strangest and most haphazard manner I've ever experienced. Seated in row 46 there were about 5 rows behind and two rows ahead in our section. They began serving the rows at the back first, but then stopped, skipped the front three including my own row, then moved on to the next section of seating. After starting at the front t of that section they worked their way backwards until our row was the very last served. This meant room temperature food, and a wait of over an hour all while enjoying the aroma of food in the cabin directly behind us. In addition, the cabin crew disappeared completely for about 6 hours in the middle of the flight. At some point some snacks were placed in the galley area but we were never notified or served. I just happened to see someone seated ahead of me return with ice cream and was lucky to be in an aisle seat where I could grab one myself. The sole redeeming quality was the low cost of the flight, $360 RT, but the poor quality of the A380 cabin and crew means I would never recommend it.

Then at the end of the flight, where I did not sleep (I usually do and this time I even took a sleeping pill), we got the worst breakfast.  The flight is a connecting flight through Paris, but you have to take a bus to from orly to Charles de Gaulle which. This is terrible by itself but it becomes much worse when you have no clue what to do and have to pick up tickets on your own somewhere else, then we had to wait for almost an hour for the bus to CDG! Almost missing our connecting flight, stressful and ridiculous the way this is organised.

I couldn't check in and select seats online before the departure, so I only found out that our given and family names got back front in the system the night before our departure. This eventually caused serious loss, inconvenience and panic for us. My complaints to Air France are based on Very inefficient and bad communication service. My friend (whose first language is English) called Air France to address this issue many times on the night before our departure, our call was always transferred to the Air France office in the Philippines. The staff there had limited English, couldn't understand my friend much and it was also very difficult for my friend to understand them. He called more than 10 times, and only figured out the names cannot be changed but we are still not sure the reason. Air France and China Eastern tried to blame each other rather than helping us out. The day for our departure, we went to the airport to talk with the China Eastern. The staff there said names back front happens every day, the airlines can change them for us but it has to be Air France. We called Air France on site a few times with China Eastern staff together, we got the same answer, the names cant be changed because our flights were operated by China Eastern! China Eastern airport staff didn't let us board as they insisted that Air France has to change our names. As a result, we were stuck and had to see our flights leave in front of us, which was one of the most frustrating experience in my life.  We eventually went home, called Air France office many times to negotiate. At last, they said the only way they could offer was to make our tickets as a voucher of 3200 AUD, we had to still book Air France to use the voucher. Being desperate, we booked another Air France tickets, the cheapest one is 6600 AUD for two people, which meant we had to pay the same amount of money again to catch the plane that night. Also, our planned trip was greatly disturbed as these cheap tickets meant we had to come back Australia 2 days later, which caused my visa issue (one day overstay in Austria), two days work, and extra two days hotel and food cost.

Plates are consistently not cleared so space around the seat is just a horrendous clutter by the end of it.

Wouldn＊t fly Air France again regardless of the good seat and decent food. The lounge too was a bit underwhelming, with appointments at Clarins Spa and seating being very hard to come by.

The first meal service was very slow, more than 3 hours to serve the meal. The portions were incredibly small - the chicken dish contained maybe 5 pieces of chicken, 2 pieces of broccoli, and a piece of unknown food. Small snacks were available during the flight, but the real let down was the snack before landing in Vancouver. It was a bizarre tasting chicken pastry wrap, which didn't have much chicken and did not taste at all like a pastry. It was too sweet, too mushy, and too salty. The seats, although not exactly spacious, were tolerable, although the aisles are very narrow, and cabin crew and other passengers frequently bumped into me while walking up and down the aisles. Cabin crew were generally responsive to passengers' request, and once or twice during the flight, came down the aisles with drinks.

The catering on board was fairly good and tasty - the appetizers and the main course were generally well cooked, although the cabin crew were very slow with the meal service. It took almost 3 hours after departure from Vancouver for the meal service to be completed. Prior to arrival, a light breakfast was served, which contained a croissant, a small egg and bacon sandwich, and a mango puree. BA's catering on this flight was generally good. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Heathrow, passengers had to wait over 90 minutes for checked baggage to arrive. No explanation was given, and not a single member of ground staff came to assist passengers or provide any information about when checked baggage would arrive.

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Keflavik,24-Jun,2,3,1,,,3,2,no,2,"   We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of ?600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight ",negative,-0.739912,0,50,9.569622,7.266827

Spending an extra hour in the American/BA lounge at JFK was not ideal. Cold environment, cold staff, indifferent to the travellers needs. One area was exceptionally dirty with plates on the tables and napkins strewn on the floor. Waited for a drink as no one to serve. Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight.

The agent said they couldn＊t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call.

Explained we were going to his mother＊s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can＊t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed.

However, on this occasion at least and as the flight is one hour that was not an issue. Cabin crew were great, very professional and efficient, cabin was clean and aircraft seemed pretty up to date. I was surprised to find that business class was served an 'afternoon tea' complete with champagne (much nicer than the poor Prosecco in the lounge). We had three small sandwiches, chocolate cake and a choice of plain or fruit scone. Strawberry jam and clotted cream on the side for those who wanted them.

We luckily checked email before we went to bed and found out it was canceled. We then called BA, and after waiting 30 minutes someone to answer the call, the person who finally did said he was going to move us to a United Air flight leaving an hour later from Heathrow to SF the next day. He told us the flight number and said he had booked us business class seats. It took a long time to get it all worked out, so we got just a few hours sleep that night, but it looked like it was resolved. Then, however, when we got to Heathrow early the next morning we found that the BA person did not complete the booking as needed and United could not give us seats. They said we needed to call BA to get them to complete the change. But despite numerous attempt we could not get anyone to answer the phone at BA. This went on for 2 hours. Finally, by the grace of god, after hours of stress trying to figure out what to do, we found a United ticket agent at the airport who personally called BA for us and got then to fix the problem. So, after being at Heathrow at 7 am, we ended up leaving for SF late that afternoon totally exhausted. The United air ticket agent saved us and allows us to get home.

Unfortunately that was not to be. Also in Business Class were two families with children under 5. It was a very long flight listening to a toddler not just crying but screaming for seven out of the eight hours. Now its not the childrens fault, I do however think that the cabin crew could have maybe internvene and helped a little more but also BA should have informed us as we paid alot of money and quite frankly could have saved that money and just had economy ticket as at least we would be a few grand better off.

Firstly, the website was very easy to use, however, I object to the policy put in place with regards to having to pay for preferred seating. Checking-in online was a very easy process other than being presented with the fee to select a seat. At the boarding gate in Hannover the staff were superb, they insisted that people with larger bags turned over the bags for check-in. I was included in this. The staff were very fair and polite and imposed this policy evenly and in a firm but polite manner. The flight took off reasonably on-time. The cabin crew were very good and coped really well with what was an entirely full flight. The now usual small bottle of water and a tiny snack the size of a UK 50p coin were issued to the passengers. On this flight, the Captain was very vocal in the nicest possible way. He oozed a sense of professionalism and was well spoken with clear and informative announcements. Disembarkation was orderly, however the cabin crew were nowhere to be seen when leaving the aircraft. Given that this was a very short flight and given the full nature of the flight too the cabin crew deserve an applause for their professionalism.

We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown.

I followed up several times throughout the flight with the cabin crew who assured me they will take a note of my seat number and someone from customer service will contact me with reimbursement. This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs.

Never again with this layout. Meal was below average from LHR to Mia, while the return was quite good. Unfortunately for BA, I flew in March with Qatar Airways business class, and not comparable. Just to highlight the difference: BA row has 8 seats, while QR has 4 seats! That＊s it. On top of that, the service is quite strange (mainly due to dividers above).

? Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Catania to Gatwick,24-May,2,1,1,,1,3,1,no,4,"  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!",negative,-0.700865,0,50,9.569622,7.266827

Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff〞another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in.

Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate ""gesture of goodwill"".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of ""goodwill"". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation.

If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you§. Although clearly not the purser＊s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke.

On our way return flight back to Phoenix February 25th, the first leg of the BA flight 0773 between Zurich and London Heathrow was delayed departure, which cause us missed the BA 0289 connection flight between Heathrow and Phoenix. First problem is that when we dash to the terminal 5 security check point at 12:00 PM, the airplane was still at gate and will not depart until 2:25 PM if it will be on schedule, we had almost 30 min at that point, however the terminal 5 security stopped us and was told we cannot pass thru the security due to airline requirement, we later realized that flight 0289 did not leave until 3:30 PM. We were directed to the customer service to re-book the flight. When we got to BA customer service transfer counter, there was only one agent available, there were least 12 passengers waiting in the lines, we were told BA was short of staffs due to British holiday during end of February and there was a soccer championship match that Sunday, so it took us at least an hour and half to rebook the same flight next day, also it seems there are not much option at all if we want to back to Phoenix on different flight on the same day. Then, the agent who re-booked the flight told us his printer was broken and we need go to Zone 2 of terminal 5 to get the ticket and hotel voucher printed. We found Zone 2 and had our ticket and voucher in hand and assure by the agent that our luggage will be on our next day flight with us as well. We also told there was a shuttle bus around the corner to take us to the hotel, however no map or detail direction provided, it took us a while to find out that the shuttle is at back side of the terminal 5, by the time we arrived at hotel we were very tired. Next day, we arrived at airport few hours ahead our scheduled departed time 2:25 PM, I noticed my checked two bags not in the same spot based on my iPhone＊s Find me feature (I had Apple Air Tag in each of my checked bags), so I checked with the gate agent, she confirmed with me that only one checked bag was associated with my flight! Luckily, the flight was delayed two hours, so my other bag made to the same flight. While on the flight, the team of young flight attendants were generally pleasant, but they missed to service me meal, I did not order any special meal, and the popular chicken dish was not available when she came to my row, so I told her any chicken dish will be ok, and she told me give her few minutes and she will bring me a different chicken dish, however she totally forgot that and only when she came back to collect the trash, I mentioned to her she forgot my chicken dish, she was surprised and acting like I was lying to her.

Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I＊ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn＊t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it＊s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door).

Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new ""no need to empty your bag"" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging.

The flights left on time and we even arrived early for nearly each one of our flights. Food was generous and quite tasty for Economy class with the crew coming around with water/drinks throughout the flights. Our checked luggage also arrived safely and undamaged both at VCE and our return flight to YUL. On all of our flights the crew were attentive, friendly, and helpful with us and our children, especially the gentlemen who served us on the return flights from VCE to YUL on March 5th. The B787-8 interior is really dated and really needs to be updated to compete with their European counterparts. There were panels squeaking loudly when we hit turbulence, seat covers coming off the seats, and tray tables which were not level and loose for eating. The IFE on the B787-8 worked fine, but it definitely wasn't as responsive and did not have a newer, larger screen like the ones on the B777-200. Thankfully, the B777-200 have had their interior updated but the one we flew on had a clogged sink in one of the lavatories, which created problems for passengers. Unfortunately, on nearly all of our flights, there was garbage left in the seat pockets and the floors weren't quite as clean. On the incoming flight to LHR, the B787-8 was not assigned a gate because we arrived early into the airport, which resulted in significant delays for the airport buses to get to the plane and also slowed down the deplaning process.

It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?).

I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back.

First of all, boarding to our flight to Mexico city was done with buses. Every inch of the bus was filled with passengers and we couldn't even breath. The Club World experience is not personalised and it doesn't make you feel special. The flight crew were giving the welcome drinks as if giving free food at a food bank and I wasn't offered a non-alcoholic choice due to sitting on the last row of business class cabin. The same rude serving attitude happened when the flight attendant was serving ice-cream mid-flight on the way out. He literally threw the ice cream to my head as I was in the middle seat that is covered from all sides that makes flight attendants hard to reach.  The most striking issue with the cabin is the state that the seats are in. They were their old style yin-yang seats and they looked pretty old, with no storage space, and most functionalities are working with a struggle. My entertainment screen was not working well and it was quite unstable. When the flight attendants were playing the security on my way out, neither of the seats in my area playing the safety video and the flight attendants had to re-demonstrate the security instructions manually. On the way in, the crew opened my screen for security demonstration but it kept closing in. When I asked if there is a way to keep the screen open, the flight attendant joked saying ""I will tell the pilot to fly with an angle so that the screen is pulled down and it will stay open"".  I found this attitude unacceptable. The screens were old and bad quality.  I was quite underwhelmed by the food provided on board.

So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience.

They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It＊s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots.

? Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to Miami,23-Dec,2,1,2,2,,3,2,no,2," Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin＊s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can＊t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a ?300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at ?75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. ",negative,-0.536846,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable.

It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers?

Good storage space around the seat and charging point. Flights on time - no delays. Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation. Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast. On two sectors the main course (no choice offered) was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil - in business class? Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights.

BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in ""business class"" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the ""narrow"" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was ""pleasant & perfunctory"" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost.

Realizing the impracticality of this, I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 3-4 hours. Shockingly, the customer support representative flatly refused, citing an inability to change my flight. Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures, I received no assistance. To add to the frustration, the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation. Moreover, the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues. Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent, and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India, allegedly contributing to the subpar service. This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future.

Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed.

As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I＊ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn＊t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use.

I flew business class from LHR to PDX on the BA nonstop. It was a 787每8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn＊t help but stare at one another. It couldn＊t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn＊t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I＊m not sure why they didn＊t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I＊d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa.

Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me ""so you want a P and a C"". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said ""so you want beef and sea""? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying ""P"" for panacotta and ""C"" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, ""so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish"", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes.",positive,0.36328,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu. As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow.

Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it＊ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren＊t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers.

This airline failed on all fronts. Quoted us a price of 6,000 each (I was traveling with my husband), which we could not do. Almost didn't let me on the plane, trying to interpret my medical report. They did not attempt to change our seats, which were near the back. The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches. Might I add, I am nearly 70. Had to exit same way. No wheelchair waiting for me at Heathrow, had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so.

Buckle up, folks; this one's a rollercoaster. On July 16 and 17, 2023, I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7, and let me tell you, it was a nightmare. The initial flight from Zurich (ZRH) to London (LHR) on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable one-hour delay upon arrival at LHR. This, of course, resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo, triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo (HND) via Beijing with Air China. Oh, but the fun didn't stop there 〞 flight CA183 was also delayed, turning my 16-hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours, finally arriving in Tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10. And the cherry on top? My four checked-in suitcases decided to take a detour and didn't join me in Tokyo, forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center. I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23, because why make it easy, right? But wait, there's more! My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich (BA8) on August 8 also danced to the delay tune, making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways. The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans, stealing a whole day of scheduled activities, including a guided Tokyo tour. As if that weren't enough, I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses〞extra airport transfers, tour operator assistance fees, emergency purchases, airport meals, and international calls for rearrangements. The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake. Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle, and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating. British Airways, you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet. Here's hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now, it's not a good look.

There were no options to purchase food or drink. There were no entertainment options available. I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status. First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded, understaffed and poorly equipped. The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations - even when having the top status. The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket.

I shall start by reference to the booking process. I used the BA website to reserve the seat and food the website to be easy to use and clear in every aspect. The flight was due to depart from terminal 3 but the passengers were bussed for a good 15 minutes to a different part of the airport where the aircraft was on a stand. When boarding the flight the cabin-crew kept a very low profile and this was maintained during the entire flight. The captain made 3 brief announcements during the flight. There was no in-flight entertainment. The seats were clean and comfortable enough for a short flight. The lack of catering was overt. Other than a tiny bottle of water and an inedible ※breakfast bar§ one had to use an online system to order even a drink and of course pay for it too. The passengers next to me could not use the online system as it doe not seem to work and the cabin refused to sell them a coffee because of this fault. Moreover, the USB charge points did not work either. Given the early hour of the flight it is a poor show that there are not even for sale items available from a trolley service. The system BA have in place is not good enough. The flight arrived on-time. The disembarkation was inefficient though and poorly managed and the crew were not to be seen. The crew were wearing the new BA uniform and it seems to reflect a downward trend of the airline. To be candid, there was any difference between this BA service and that of so-called ※budget§ rivals. On this route BA have a monopoly and so I did not have an option to use the services of a different company.",negative,-0.708437,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

However, it must be said that the value for money was poor: with a checked bag on the return leg only, this was a nearly ?700 ticket.

When we checked into Heathrow, the line was extremely long and only one person was checking people in. It took nearly an hour to get to the counter.

Having noted the ratings given, frankly, I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service. In a nutshell, BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation. This fact was hammered home on my return leg, which was not in Club Europe. Quite alarmingly, BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its ""Business Class"" seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency. I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen. Short-haul business (Club Europe) is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for lounge/pre-boarding benefits. While cabin crew service is excellent, the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices, etc. places them a million 'air'miles behind competing airlines, such as Qatar, Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality. BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers - really? I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name ""Budget Airways"" The attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer care/appreciation between British Airways and another airline used in this trip.

Despite paying well over the odds for business class, we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flight. When it was finally cancelled, the BA staff. Without explanation, told everyone to go to a gate. After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control, a further 40 minute wait. By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA. A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags. BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation. Many slept in a bus stop overnight. There were people with young children who couldn＊t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left. The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 1/2 hr flight.

The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in Heathrow. The total delay was roughly an hour, but it was enough to make our connection a challenge, where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to Dublin. When we headed to our connection flight, we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed. This was twenty minutes prior to departure time. They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked. Given the busy weekend of travel, we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed. We then waited 3 hours for our luggage, and then took a cab to London's City Airport. The cab fare was roughly $500. When I filed a claim with British Airways, they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare. This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight. The person who rebooked us, told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departure. I will never fly this awful airline again.

In addition I had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when I excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who weren＊t being served. Then we got to Heathrow and the real fun began. We had a 4 hour delay. They gave us about 5 different excuses for the delay. I had a few employees walk away while I was asking them questions.

There was no place to comfortably store items in business class. I＊ve never experienced that before. Not even a cup holder for my bottle of water. The seat controls didn＊t work well.

In fact everyone refused to help us. It was Saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go home. Anyone with a connecting flight couldn't rebook on the application because the app wouldn't disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us. They gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the app. Finally I got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next day.

I don't have the money to pay for this but after a 10 hour flight, 8 hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from British Airways would help us I took the room. Of course I claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything since so I have no idea when or how much I'll be reimbursed, even though I'm not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference. It's financially difficult for me right now because the money I had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course it's impossible to reach them by phone.

No reason was given for the denied boarding by the check in staff at the British Airways counter in Madrid, who said they were only agents and told us to call British Airways. We were three hours early for the flight and had valid passports. After many tries we finally reached British Airways by phone, but we were told to call Expedia which had booked the flights. Expedia confirmed that we had been bumped from the flight, with no explanation as to why. Expedia then began a long process of finding alternative flights. Over the next 24 hours we had numerous calls with both Expedia and British Airways. Incredibly, the next available flights were 9 days later on April 3. This was almost unbelievable, but after many many tries it was the best we could do. Even though these were Business Class tickets. Part of the problem was that apparently rules did not allow any changes to routing for any segment of the flight. This nine day delay was a major problem for us. I had to miss work and my daughter was missing school. Further, we received no compensation from British Airways, no penalty fee, and not any reimbursement of our expenses for staying the nine extra days. After our return I began the British Airways online complaint process, and submitted all supporting documents. I received an email reply and a case reference number. And then nothing. I sent numerous follow up emails, and received no replies. It is now months later, and still I have not heard from British Airways. This is shocking, and definitely the worst airline service I have received for my thousands of flights over many decades.

I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport, and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation, when I was already at the airport. The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers. The ground staff＊s attitude was that they are merely third party agents, not BA employees, and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all, telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help. They couldn＊t even provide us a phone number, telling us to look it up on ba.com ! So BA abandoned its passengers. They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled, meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day (although other airlines were still operating the route- but BA refused to rebook us on them). The reason given for both cancellations was ※technical reasons§. No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation, nor any information on help regarding food/ accommodation help etc. Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem, not theirs. I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later, which wasn＊t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night. I rang BA＊s call centre and again, they showed a high degree of callousness. 95% of the half-hour call was spent with me waiting on hold, with the phone just cutting off after half an hour, and no meaningful information given to me by that point. There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut (and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport), even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details. They just don＊t care. In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away , waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted.

There was Wi-Fi on board, fast enough to even send videos via messaging apps. Service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth. The food was alright and no more.

How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy. Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised. The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position. There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping . The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of. The whole business class set up is a sick joke. Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off.

Despite the clear mishandling of my baggage by their team, they refused to offer any reimbursement or even a modest amount of airline credit. Their customer service was not only ineffective but also astonishingly callous. Their response was, in essence, ""It's your fault for trusting us with your belongings.""

On arrival in Rome, my wife was forced to walk to the check-in desk because our reservation for wheelchair assist from the plane was never transferred by BA. She was told by the cabin crew that there was no reservation for her transport. Also, our checked baggage (2) failed to make the BA rebooked flight from London to Rome. BA took 9 days to deliver my bag and 12 days to deliver my wife's. I called BA Baggage Claim Services daily. I was frequently cut off after waiting on hold for over an hour. We had Apple Air tags in both bags, and sent pictures showing their exact location to BA Baggage Claim several times. After 5 days, BA stated that they found my wife's bag, but needed to verify ownership! Both bags as described had bright pink 4§ easily visible tags and bright pink bows. Taking 9 and 12 days to deliver them is inexcusable. Our return date: July 3 - BA 553, Rome to London. BA 297, London to Chicago. All flights were late. We arrived in Chicago more than 3 hours late, missing our ground transportation to our home in Michigan (3 hours away). We had to find a hotel and stay overnight near Chicago. On July 12 we filed our expenses for replacement of lost clothing and toiletries, also for food purchased at Heathrow due to the flight delay and overnight hotel charges in Chicago. After 2 weeks, I went online asking for some follow-up on both cases, but have had no response at all from BA. We are retirees on fixed income, and cannot fund BA＊s errors.

Being that I was relatively early at the gate, I was one of the first passengers there. After some time boarding had opened. First the business class got called up, then families with children and disabled people. A couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people, one by one, by name. Then there was an announcement: they won＊t let anyone in anymore. Me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in. The reason, they said, was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered, speaking to a manager, that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked). After the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldn＊t be let in anymore. Nothing changed and everyone was sent away. I had a connecting flight later that day that I was going to miss because I was not let on the plane. First I tried to get my luggage back which I didn＊t receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnel. Then, just like everyone who was going to fly with the same plane, I wanted to talk to someone from British Airways.

All the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund. I waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today. Trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversation. After the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from the same flight went back to the check-in counter to get a confirmation from them that I will receive a refund. Being that there was a new shift the personell did not know what had happened. When they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault I could not attend the flight. It looked like I had missed it. For everyone standing there with me it was exactly the same. But the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it. Later on we were able to speak to the manager after many phone calls he said they were going to take care of it. We are supposed to get an email at some point in the future. I was not able to get a written confirmation that I will get refunded even after several times asking for it. I already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me. Not only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way. In the end the only option for me to get to my destination would have been to book a last minute flight for a lot of money which I would not know if I ever got it backed.",negative,-0.739102,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gibraltar to London Heathrow,23-May,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," Terrible Experience with British Airways. I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase ""abandoned"" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another ?125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn't care. They said there was nothing they could do. I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again.",negative,-0.748137,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund.

For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we＊d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we＊d get first choice at the second service which they couldn＊t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each.

But there were no other seats available. We got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours we suffered. When we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person.

British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges.

Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience. I used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it's a case of flying budget, or flying budget for double the price with BA.

Except, don't fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for ?100+ in each direction, as I did. (I flew economy out and business back, while my brother flew business, then economy.) The business seats are identical to economy, with no seats blocked, so you are squished in four abreast. The meals are almost identical, with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your ?100. The only real plus is Champagne. But on my flight, there was none because of ""supply issues"". The cabin attendant (I think his name was Tom) must be one of the best in the business.

We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home＃.we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. When arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can＊t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta. We were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. In total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. Unfortunately the drama continues.

When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me ""Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance."" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me.

Don＊t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 每 When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn＊t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that＊s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn＊t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 每 If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again. And if this review helps one person that heeds my advice, then my job is done.",negative,-0.674699,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

Hard, thin, uncomfortable seats, poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty - I remain shocked that BA allow this, and it's time for BA's CEO and management focused on standards rather than bean counting.

We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 mins. Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. The inflight magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times.

I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out.

Not Verified ,Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to London,23-Apr,4,2,1,5,1,3,1,no,5," Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service. If there are other options available I would choose them over BA these days.",negative,-0.583113,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

When I arrived at LAX one of my bags were missing. There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn＊t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn＊t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn＊t have my bag. In January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations.

The First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available.

The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid.

They made me wait for nearly 4 weeks and they asked me to pay either ?316 on top of the ?450 that I paid previously. Or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of ?80. (Tax only). I found it ridiculous that they told me to pay a fraction of the money I previously paid. Each time I call them, they hang up on me; or they continue telling me to pay ?360.

Not one of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant. The seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly, if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own, or else you are breathing in the head/ scalp of the person in front of you. Food was revolting, they don't even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre-meal drinks and the secondary meal. The last time I flew BA it was a completely other experience and I was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid. It was really majorly disappointing and I regret that I have already purchased 2 other intercontinental trips with the company. I will now have to see if I can change them.

The second leg, from Heathrow to Nassau, the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable. Cabin service was fine - I appreciated that they didn't come through the cabin often while everyone was sleeping. The meals weren't that great to be honest. After landing in Heathrow, we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate. My connection was less than an hour long! The BA staff in the Heathrow Airport helped me move through security quickly and I made it with time to spare for my next flight. When I arrived in Nassau, I found that my luggage didn't make it due to the short connection time in London. The BA baggage representative in Nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim.

? Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Dubrovnik,23-Mar,1,3,2,,,5,5,yes,7,"  
Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option. Given 1 point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard.",negative,-0.4676,0,49,9.569622,7.266827

Get to LHR at 12.00, email to say flight cancelled. No one able to help at LHR, said to use the app. Only halfway sensible option was from LCY-AMS at 17.05, so taxi over there as trains from LHR not working (ok, not BA's fault). Get to LCY, showing as cancelled on screen, so check the app and there it is. Rebook again via the app to the 15.30 departure, go to desk to drop bag and was told that I was only on standby for the flight, with no guarantee of a seat, despite the app telling me it was confirmed. The 18.35 to AMS was already overbooked so was moved onto the 19.30 flight to Rotterdam. The 15.30 and 18.35 were both cancelled anyway, as it happened. Eventually took off and the best thing I can say is that it landed intact. Return from AMS-LHR, similar story. Arrive at AMS, screen shows the 21.00 is cancelled. Quickly check app, and confirmed it was. No emails, no texts, nothing. Rebooked via app to the 22.00 departure, so could have been worse. Desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight. Overall, dreadful. They just don't care and hide behind apps and automated call centres.

Old, dirty, uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had, one would not recline and one reclined without using the button.

? Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Munich,23-Mar,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known for. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I＊d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ＆computer says no＊. If this is the service level for silver members I can＊t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn＊t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I＊d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn＊t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn＊t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there＊s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn＊t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. The plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service.

They wouldn't acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though, I booked and paid for the tickets.

? Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Madrid,23-Feb,2,1,1,,,1,2,no,1,"  My review relates to the appalling experiences I had with British Airways on 14th February 2023. I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that ※there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you§. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to ※go online to rebook your seat§. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport ※must be wrong§. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a ?30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight.

Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out.

Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only.

As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling up the Customer Service team for British Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking.

The food was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey, 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes. Poor in taste and quality. Mousse desert was great though. Slight issue during the snack meal. Ordered a childs option which was marked as such. Regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same.

? Trip Verified ,"A320, A380",Family Leisure,Business Class,Vienna to Los Angeles via London Heathrow,23-Jan,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height.

IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight.

We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn＊t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won＊t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other ※arrangements§ will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN 〞 LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves.

There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening. The boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate. Despite BA using a group system to board, it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers. The flight itself was good, with a good Club meal service. The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA.

I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle.

These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it＊s just become an experience to be endured. BA＊s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA＊s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn＊t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight.

I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid ?150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a ?50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a ?50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken.

Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come.

When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn＊t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time).

Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient.

Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris.

It was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result. Part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it.

I call every 2-3 days and nothing has been done to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situation. I will never book with BA again. Sure, flying with them is easy, but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted time.

All apparently went well from check-in through the flight. After that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom. We waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband's nor mine came. I found a BA service person to ""help"" me. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., ""Your bag was loaded onto the plane""; ""Your bag is on its way to baggage claim""). BA doesn't seem to have anything like this. In this case, again, it appears BA cannot even locate the bag.

I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn't find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I'd get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn't getting a full refund. I didn't cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HK. After another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email. ""Thanks for contacting us about your claim for EU compensation. We're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to Heathrow on 29 April 2022.

The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor.

A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came round after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick, no delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternative.

Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US, they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security, I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DO&CO was exceptional, I don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-Atlantic flight in economy. It will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station.

We have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. As this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation.

At the 3rd attempt, after I cc the CEO on my complaint I got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket.

My flight to Paris was no exception. Not only was the flight late, overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff - that we sat on the tarmac, full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on (front and then back) left me gobsmacked. As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris. As it transpired I was over 90 minutes late and missed the meeting I was flying to Paris to attend. Never again.",negative,-0.828602,1,48,9.308374,5.777652

We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer. At the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago! Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the ""Points game"" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal. Had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it. In summary would I ever fly with BA again? No, not if I had half a chance of going with another airline.

After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin.

We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy.

The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth. Apart from a rather turbulent ride, the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule.

Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn＊t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn＊t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband＊s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I＊d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved.

Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn.

The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief.

This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting.

The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets.

Eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs, where a very angry person told us it was our fault, and we should have been given a letter. We had no letter. They then put us on a bus to the other terminal. When we arrived, there was nobody to greet us. We were literally just left there. We had to, yet again, contact another airline, who managed to find us transport to the hotel. When we got there, we were told it was full and we couldn't choose our rooms.

While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a ?12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for ?12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday.

The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards.

I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra?

Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off.

Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn＊t, with no apologies or even trying.

Once we finally found the check-in desks, luggage drop and check-in was appalling. It took us over 1.5 hours to get our bags checked (and we were half way through the queue). The whole process was disorganised and very slow, really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small, impatient kids.

It took me close to an hour to bagdrop. Getting onto the aircraft in Glasgow, no hello from the crew and the same getting off.  I normally find BA cabin crew very nice. Breakfast was a very tired looking croissant.  I used the BA lounge in Terminal 3. Not very keen on the new table service. Poor choice and miniscule portions. Lounge staff were very nice in both directions. On arrival at LHR there was a coach transfer from T5 to T3. We were packed in like sardines. So much for social distancing. The flight from LHR to Pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins. Captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers. No drinks or anything offered while we waited. Food was not even worth mentioning. As far as Club Europe goes it's not worth the extra cost. No priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in Pisa, seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off. The first officer summed it up when we arrived in Pisa- Sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by BA, and he was right. For the return trip on Hogmanay we left on time. I've never been on a flight to or from Pisa which has left in time. Pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable. On board I gave the food a miss.  Heathrow back to Glasgow Flight left on time. Food was an antipasto of some sort which I declined.  Both cases were last off again. Club Europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin.

These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time. CPT had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration.

The A320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting. Row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus, makes the 1-hour hop very comfortable. Once again, amazing staff, and they were even more attentive and accommodating to Gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed.

Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ＆chic＊ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It＊s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was ?200 one way (?600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.",positive,0.6592,1,47,8.215818,-7.478735

Boarding was chaos and we left an hour late. A320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free, you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat. There is no inflight screen no overhead screen. Although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back.

That did not meet my needs so I requested cancellation and to get my bags back, I was told to cancel my booking on the BA APP, they could not do it at the desk.

Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all.

Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to London,21-Jul,3,4,1,3,,1,1,no,1,"  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight.

Took the 7am flight from T5 at Heathrow to Paris CDG on 22nd November, which was boarded by bus from a remote gate. The bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load, standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full. The result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms! A second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it. It is shameful that BA ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process, and whilst the flight was okay, this serves to underline how BA seem happy to disregard any Covid-19 safety protocols in the airport environment. In contrast, on recent Air France and Iberia flights, their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers.

Customer service is non existent. However, of course if you call the ""new booking"" line someone immediately picks up of course, however they can't help me nor put me through to anyone apparently. Shambolic excuse of an airline that doesn't deserve to be a national airline. I haven't had these problems at all and I've been flying throughout covid (for work unfortunately).

The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80＊s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it＊s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can＊t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they＊re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I＊ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I＊ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I＊ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my ?2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won＊t extend the voucher! I＊m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I＊m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I＊ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that!

I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says ""therefore we can't answer your call; try again."" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I've now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked. They have offered that if I send them a Greek doctor's note saying that I was sick, then they'll give me a voucher for a future flight from Mykonos to New York.

We just had one bad experience after another on this route in July 2021.  British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies). BA damaged our Samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online. We have been trying to resolve this issue since July and after asking us for photos like 10 times, they are still giving us the run around. ",negative,-0.787058,1,47,8.215818,-7.478735

Flights get cancelled, the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app, invariably this is not possible. You cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for 40 plus minutes to speak to someone. If they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptly.

After flying with Aeroflot and S7 Airlines, I expected to receive an excellent BA service, but I got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of water. I think it＊s unacceptable for a non-low-cost carrier to offer service like this. I can get that hot meals on board are now rare. I loved the most comfortable seats in my life!

It was fast enough to stream a movie on Netflix. If you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like BA pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier.

I recently had to arrange to have surgery in Budapest and naturally wanted to fly BA. So I booked my flights from BHD to BUD via LHR online on their site. Once booked I informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrived. I would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not＃ *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. I had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin English. Anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. So I took the earlier flight but this meant I had to fly into London the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. So operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Needless to say I was furious. I complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. Great excuse, only having looked at BUD arrivals info, Ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. So BA＊s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. Epilogue: I got refunded most of my money from the flights I booked with BA, although they refused to refund my BHD - LHR flights because who knows? I also lost the money I had spent on a hotel and half of the money I had spent on booking airport transfers. Given the cavalier attitude BA seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that I lost a not inconsiderable sum of money, I＊ve decided to avoid BA from now on.",negative,-0.772884,1,47,8.215818,-7.478735

Note that BA actually charges for seat pre-selection in biz class -- 100 UK pounds in this case! Does any other airline in the world dare do that? I saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free. The seats were BA's universally derided, cramped 6-across back-to-front configuration, where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away. No other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement --- I wonder why? No preflight drink was offered. At meal time I selected one of the three main offerings, only to be told it wasn't available -- even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section. The seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position. The ""bed"" is the narrowest I have experienced in biz class, and is also very hard. The cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; I had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm. The amenity kit is the smallest I've ever seen in biz class -- it fits in the palm of the hand. All in all, this uncomfortable, miserly experience is hardly worth the ?5,727 that BA charges for this route.

Fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment, which the staff do an admirable job with - but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of BA First at the moment. Firstly - no lounge at all at Mexico City Terminal 2. There's a paid lounge, but the check in staff wouldn't help with the details. Mexico City Terminal 1 has functional lounges for AeroMexico working. Not good enough for an expensive ticket. Finally got to board and the staff are incredible - but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come. The food was literally inedible in First and staff offered commented as much every time. So for an 11 hour trip in First the option really was chocolate or crisps. The first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention. The seat would not easily convert to a bed. It had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby. Again, not what you'd expect from a premium product. I left my watch on the flight in error and contacted BA immediately about this. Despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during Covid my watch was never found. BA has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers. Given that I told them specifically where I'd left the watch I can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it. All in all, you pay premium on a flight for additional service.

The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn＊t do it, as my results didn＊t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive.

She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can＊t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don＊t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven＊t met them. I don＊t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines!

Crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end. When leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing. On way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged. A guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight. He had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything.  Not like the crew were busy either, did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didn＊t see them.

Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled. Overall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service I received.",positive,0.65006,1,46,8.280711,-8.263848

Although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight, other features didn＊t let me down either. Efficient business class check in at Warsaw, cosy executive lounge Preludium with attentive and helpful staff, well organised boarding (although no priority for Club Europe because of Corona). The aircraft was very fresh and clean. Seats were comfortable with enough legroom, adjustable headrests and power ports. The on board service is different than before Corona times but it＊s still very good. Tasty lunch box from DO&CO with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse. The choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality Champagne from Nicolas Feuillatte. All in all a perfect flight experience with British Airways.

They claim I traveled on AF65 and arrived in London ahead of schedule. The truth is that BA at LAX rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however AF refused to accept me and my baggage unless I paid them a surcharge. So, BA then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into Paris and misconnect and have to overnight there.

A number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack (small bag of crisps and 250ml of water).  It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. Also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck.

My understanding is that BA and AA have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners, though I was shocked at having to pay nearly $1000 just to reserve our seats in business class, but this is apparently not the case. I was told that if BA cancels the two flights that we are booked on that I might be able to get either a voucher or a refund. I was prepared today to accept a voucher that I could use when I rebook this trip for 2021, as I understand that BA (and all airlines) are suffering financially as much as I am, but I was not prepared to be totally ripped off by BA.

The customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight BA would be putting me on as a replacement. 11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone call. I tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! I decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and I didn't want to end up stuck in Australia. I had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt I had no other choice. When I got back home I raised this with BA. They told me that I was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! I'd never even heard that term before. He simply said BA would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight, he didn't say I had to do anything. So now because I was given the incorrect advice, I am out of pocket by a considerable amount. I raised it with the BA complaints team that I had been advised incorrectly and if I had been told I needed to do an involuntary change myself I would have done so. They were extremely unhelpful and just said that they don't know why I was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it.

Next day I managed to get on board the flight. Sadly due to my fault, I forgot my laptop inside the Aircraft on arrival to terminal 5. I was one of the last passengers to leave the plane. I realised my mistake after I passed security and I was not allowed back into the Airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and I understand why I could not go back to the Aircraft. They gave me a number to call and I have been calling the number since March, so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items. Basically BA does not have means in place for passengers to find their items. My laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence I just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane.

Breakfast a little small but tasty. I even got a 2nd cup of tea! Journey smooth with some sleep. I stopped flying BA for 10 years because the head office is so poor - the staff on the ground are good but BA as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed: e.g. over securing client's data, telling passengers what is going on, running a decent frequent flier programme, design of the business cabin (stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo!) and so on.

How can I make travel arrangements by May 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? I understand BA has policies in place, but I cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with COVID-19. I feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still British Airways. British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. I guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policy.

Add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience. Thankfully, the upper deck of the A380 was more civilised, with an efficient, if slightly distant, cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by 2 hours after takeoff, allowing plenty of time for sleep. Food was mediocre and I've given up expecting anything more from BA's business class product. The White Company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement, and breakfast has become rather perfunctory, with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant. Arrival at a chilly LHR was ahead of schedule and we were curbside 30 minutes after landing. Reliability is currently BA's strongest card.",negative,-0.472887,1,46,8.280711,-8.263848
? Trip Verified ,Boeing 777-200,Business,Business Class,Las Vegas to Gatwick,20-Jan,2,2,2,4,,4,1,no,3,"  Las Vegas to Gatwick. A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast, friendly and efficient. The lounge was something from the dark ages, all 1970's wooden panels.",negative,-0.580732,1,46,8.280711,-8.263848

Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. But I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European airlines such as Lufthansa and streets ahead of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel vouchers just said ＆Holiday Inn＊. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. Next, the replacement flights. The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the full website on a PC showed my replacement flights. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. On calling BA they wouldn＊t talk to me because I ＆failed＊ security- I didn＊t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company＊s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on this? When I called they had no explanation and only agreed to ＆exceptionally＊ change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes well, BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. But old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong.

I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. Apparently things have improved somewhat since, so I decided to give them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. On the plus side: I flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31"". Pilots were very good and informative, as always with BA. Quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. Cathay Pacific's is far superior. The two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy fare. It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. If I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I'd fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! This just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering on short-haul. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant.

My partner headed to the back where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from. Both our TV's stopped working mid flight also for a period of 40 minutes. We asked the staff if they could fix the problem. The lady said she would try while sighing.

When I got to the entrance we showed our boarding passes and I can only assume the lady must have overheard our previous conversation as my wife was asked if she was bringing me in as her guest. No warm greeting, just a job's worth high handed attitude. Neither of the BA reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly.

The business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side. It meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken. Unfortunately although they were pleasant, the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained. I asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there weren't any. I showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken. At the end of the flight I discovered the switch. Despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping. I had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times. There was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section I cannot understand why they  would not offer a third. There was Port on the menu but was never offered with cheese. Every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course. Many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal. Most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal I was ready for a mini snack. I am not a big eater but I was peckish. The layout of the business cabin is cramped. I am 6' and I could not stretch out. The seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers. This means no one has a easy seat. You either have to climb or be climbed over. I wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market. I travel on many airlines in business and BA is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one I would use. The centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers. Unfortunately, upon arrival at Bridgetown the BA team didn't get any better. After one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage I approached a guy wearing a BA tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders. I then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing. ",negative,-0.72438,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

The food was disappointing, I had smoked salmon as a starter, and British Beef as main course. My soup was cold, mybeef was overcooked) and quantity was economy class-like. The service is very friendly, but not personal. I＊m used to be adressed by my name when I fly business class.  While serving the meals, they forget serving me wine. The amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin. After dinner I went to sleep. The seat is turned into a real bed, with an extra mattress and a good pillow. The space is narrow, it is difficult to make the bed. Once the bed is made, there is no place to put  personal stuff. I had a real good night of sleep though. If your seat is not at the aisle, you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet. The toilets are small and simple, not cleaned frequently enough. When I woke up, breakfast service was running.  The breakfast is good.  Yoghurt, pastries, fresh fruit, and a full English Breakfast. Overall, British Airways World Club is a rather standard Business Class, lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience.  If BA wants to compete, they have a long way to go.

BA＊s B gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the Galleries Lounges in the main terminal. It＊s also a tad closer on the transit - or via the rather useful walkway on level -4 - to the C gates where the A380s depart from. The new boarding by groups meant snaking queues, but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily. The Club World were still the same, much maligned seats with the small, unresponsive IFE screens and limited selection of films. The dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat. Trolleys may lack glamour, but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight. Breakfast was adequate but nothing more. Landing was exactly on time. Overall, a reasonable flight but the inflight service was distinctly average.",negative,-0.735119,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

I used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively. I flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience. Food service was very poor in most aspects. I had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes. No drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing. Rather, tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed. I had to ask twice for a beer before it was delivered.This then put me out of sync with the service. The one time (yes one time!) offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely. Service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality. On a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical! Our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else. The cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing. The entertainment system is a joke as it is so old. I had become so accustomed to a normal/newish TV screen that I was blown away that this system was still in place. The screen size was the equivalent of your phone＊s. No music selection worth talking about so I just used my iPad. On this or similar routes I have flown Air Canada, WestJet, Virgin Atlantic, Air Transat. BA was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only.

We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well.

If you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you, you will need to do some major maneuvering. Touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable. I flew on a 747 both ways. They no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm. I had to ask them to turn up the a/c both ways. I was literally sweating.

I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ＆Geneva convention＊ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update!

I had tried to reserve seats on BA website twice and was not able to do so. Then I tried to call BA twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option. When we arrived today in London from Toronto at the connections desk, seven hours before our flight, we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy. BA＊s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats, we were at the bottom of the list for business class, and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us, but we would still be welcome in the lounge, (as if this was a bonus). Then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge, since they could not print our boarding passes (due to the down grade). It took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk. We asked to speak to a manager, but at each of our four interactions with BA staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us, giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could. At one point I got visibly frustrated after the BA staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary, which it definitely was not! After two and a half hours BA customer service managers came to speak with us. They were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective. If British Airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight, I will not be booking flights on BA again.",negative,-0.726613,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault.",negative,-0.52206,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

I was supposed to fly with American Airlines from the USA to Dublin, but I had a connecting flight from my origin city to Chicago. Unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from Chicago to Dublin. I was put on a flight to London instead, which I had to run for when I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. I then flew with British Airways from London to Dublin. I was told to file a lost baggage claim with BA, which I did. I was told that the bag would be transferred from American to BA when it arrived in Dublin. Using American＊s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after I did around noon on Saturday. I am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. BA＊s customer service is terrible. If someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I am going to lose it! My bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city I＊m in for more than a day and I can＊t get it. Talk about serious frustration. I don＊t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. And even though their baggage claim desk was closed when I called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. Unfortunately she couldn＊t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who I could call and when to call them the next morning. I did not receive that level of service from BA. I even asked if they could call the airport and was told, ※we are not authorized to call airports.§ Why in the world wouldn＊t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? I am not thrilled with either airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help me. This has ruined the first three days of a trip that I planned for two years. If you do check a bag and it＊s lost or delayed, don＊t expect any help if you flew with BA. And here＊s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don＊t live in, don＊t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. Dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. You will get a lot more information and assistance that way. ",negative,-0.795633,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

The aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers.

The breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal bar. Only one drinks run was made.

The latter I took one bite and couldn't continue. I have had better meals in economy class in other airlines. The seat was nothing to write home about, but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class (with the price difference to match of course). The service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available. On the plus side, I am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin, instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights.

British Airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel. But in addition, if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight, you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments. With that said in 2018, my wife and I made reservations on BA to fly to Johannesburg from London for an African adventure this October, specifically 10/31. Yes, that's the day called for Brexit. Only we made our reservations before those dates were set. Considering BA pilots have called for three pilot strikes on September 2019, coupled with Brexit, we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection. The good news is close to $800 in fees for our two Business Class tickets was refunded when I changed our flights to another carrier through American Airlines Advantage. The bad news is the $220.00 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded. I called BA to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses. I was just not feeling the love here! So I am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly British Airways. All of the other outstanding carriers don't charge nearly the high fees and most don't charge for reserving your seats in advance. Instead of BA, we changed our booking to 10/30 on Etihad Airways through Abu Dhabi. Their customer service was outstanding. The fees were lower and yes, no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and I can travel next to each other. I am entering travel in September 2019, because there was no other option for future travel. This request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight.

My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it.

I am seriously considering not doing this again. The 777-200 we flew in business was dirty and old. I flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate - no headphones socket jack that operated. The screens were from the ark. Crew as always excellent but BA should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience. I was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue. I have heard to date zip. At least it was better than last year flying into DC from London when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster. That time at least we received AVIOS.

Some people were sent texts with rebooking options, others (including me) received nothing. Vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels - however some people were only given one bus voucher, meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day!

Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn＊t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I＊ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I＊m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there＊s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I＊m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided.

The handling of the situation at Heathrow was despicable, and you would think that with all the failures that BA encounter these days, they would have got this part of their act together.

? Trip Verified ,Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg OR Tambo to Cape Town,19-Jul,4,5,5,5,,5,5,yes,8," Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra ?7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route.

Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight.

I had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. The middle seat was unoccupied. Enough leg space and storage space overhead. A good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided. The IFE system was easy to use. A drink service preceded the meal service. I asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed IPA Brewdog Speedbird 100. Sensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a Heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter. The entree choices were chicken and pasta. I chose the later. Very basic food. Tea and coffee followed. Before landing a sandwich and a drink was served. I could not figure out what was in the sandwich! The bathroom was clean. Blankets and pillows were on every seat. Alighting was quick. Landing cards have been done away with. For the fare, I paid I was satisfied - no complaints.

Check-in was fairly smooth at Belfast as it was early in the morning. However, when the agent called me over the check me in, he was all flustered that I wasn't an elite Executive Club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty. I knew he was working the premium line, but nobody was standing in it, and I was standing in the regular line when he called me. After about 20 minutes, I finally got a boarding pass to go through security. The flight from BHD to LHR was uneventful and bare-bones, as nothing was served for free on the flight. My boyfriend therefore hated it, as we're used to getting better service on American in the US, but I was fully aware that BA had turned itself into a glorified EasyJet. Once we arrived to LHR, I continued by myself to Atlanta on BA and was shocked at the crowded, user-unfriendly T5. Although I suppose it was pretty in some ways, I had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called, so it felt very crowded and hot. After my flight was called, I found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people. Boarding was straightforward, however, and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers, even in economy. The flight product was just OK in my view. I had an exit row aisle seat, and while I had extra room and a nice headrest, the seat was right by the lav, so it stank. IFE was fine with a decent selection, but it was not as complete as Delta's. The food was the bland equivalent of what Delta serves, so no brownie points there, and the ""tea"" service they had was terrible: we were given half-sandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages. I remember years ago when BA was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile. Those smiles have disappeared for the most part, and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there. However, I arrived on time and promptly got my bag. The 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite, so I might fly them again, though I would not recommend BA due to the crowds and discomfort I experienced at T5.",negative,-0.330887,0,45,9.494767,7.561122

The airplane was filthy dirty in Club Class, which is bad enough having to suffer the awful, dated, Club Class ying-yang facing, narrow seats with divider. Business Class on British Airways is the worst of any airline. The WIFI was out of service. On late arrival in Nashville, my luggage arrived soaking wet, and I was unable to change clothes. On my return to the UK, I contacted British Airways Customer Relations to seek compensation, and got the usual pathetic, mainly computer generated, insincere apology. I am now forced to haggle with British Airways, and endure their woeful so-called Customer Relations department. It is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier.

Pre-take off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight. Everything went smoothly and service was good. Boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly, we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin. Much has been said about the BA ying-yang seat configuration. The seats are narrow, and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat, with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat. However the seat is very comfortable in any position, and the White Company bedding is excellent. We had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin, which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down. The centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings, and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger. The service on this flight was superb, from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight - very efficient, quick to respond, and super friendly. Preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated, with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off. There was a choice of 4 starters, 3 mains, and 3 sweets or cheeseboard, with a decent choice of wines. Breakfast offered a good choice, although we were happy with just the fruit, yoghurt, and bread. There could be no complaints in respect of catering. The A380 is a super aircraft and very quiet, but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew. Our connecting flight to Leeds was good, but compared with our South African flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat. It is a short flight, but there was still a full meal service. The only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in Leeds. The airport seems quite run-down, escalator not working, and few staff to be seen.

We received no information about its whereabouts until July 1st, and it was only delivered on July 2nd, after numerous failed attempts to contact the delivery company. The system used by Lufthansa to track luggage is utterly useless, providing no updates other than stating the luggage is being searched. The response from Lufthansa was not customer-friendly, showing no acceptance of responsibility and offering no compensation without receipts, which is merely a legal requirement. The fact that such issues occurred on both flights highlights significant problems in the logistics and capabilities of Lufthansa in providing reliable service.

Of course it did not arrive until midnight the day after landing. I waited all day and had to rush and pack for my flight early the next morning.

A Lufthansa employee in Munich laughed at us and sarcastically said to us, ""We have nice cozy pillows and blankets, you can sleep here at the airport"". In the end, we were lucky and booked the last room in a nearby hotel via Booking. We paid for the cab (120 to the hotel and back the next day) and the hotel itself. The next day there was another surprise - first our flight was 2 hours late, and then the flight was canceled again, we were not informed about this either by SMS or by email. It was a coincidence that we wanted to check the status in the LH app. We were rebooked on a flight at 10pm. We have no deodorant, no toothbrush, have been traveling in the same clothes for more than 24 hours and the question arises whether this flight will take place at all or will be canceled again. This may mean deja vu - standing in the long queue again and in the end, when they close the counter at 11 pm, you have to worry about where you can sleep, how to get to the hotel and whether there is anything else near the airport, you have to pay for everything yourself of course. There is also the frustration of not knowing how long you will have to chase your money.

I also flew my 2 Moroccan cats which I took in while living there. Because I had 2 cats I had to buy 2 seats and fly a second person with me. Each ticket had 1 checked bag and I added an additional checked bag to each ticket for 4 checked bags. I didn＊t want to rebuy every thing so I took the important stuff. Because I also wanted to take some textiles I had previously purchased I called Lufthansa to ask how much it would be to add a 3rd checked bag to one ticket. I was told over the phone the 3rd bag would be $110. I confirmed this price several times with the phone rep. However when I arrived to the airport in Casablanca from Marrakech where I was actually coming from the ticket counter took all my luggage and proceeded to charge me around $350 for that 3rd piece of luggage. I told them many times I was told $110 for the 3rd piece of luggage, they 100% did not GAF and I was forced to pay what they asked. Mind you I already spent + $1300 for the two tickets, and $220 for the two cats, and $180 for the two extra pieces of luggage I added. I filed a complaint and they tried to gaslight me telling me my luggage was ※overweight§ and this is why they charged ~$250 more (everything was in a different currency). I personally weighed all my luggage multiple times before arriving to the airport AND the airport told me the cost was due to the 3rd piece of luggage. Nothing was ever said related to my luggage being overweight. On top of this I tried to upgrade my tickets to see if that would be the cheapest way to have more luggage, I was told I could upgrade but the amount of checked luggage would be based on the ticket class I originally bought. And, on the first of the two flights my cats were forced to be separated despite me paying to have the two seats together. Even I was pressured by the airline rep to buy my seats because he told me even buying the tickets together wasn＊t a guarantee we would be seated together. What a load this company is.

Once seated, the captain came on and said that the counter attendants miscounted and still needed 10 people to get off so they randomly selected another 10 people.  I was supposed to arrive in Rome today at two but I am still seated waiting to take off because now they are questioning the load of people and where we are all seating.

Particularly bothersome to me are the narrow seat pitch in long haul Economy (impossible to open a laptop), tiny seat pockets large enough to fit, like, two bonbons, absence of reasonable Economy+ type seating, and downgrading of my home airport (PHL) to their Eurowings Discover division and its truly inedible food. But despite my better judgement, my wife made me give them another chance on our TATL flight this month, and oh boy, LH did not disappoint in showing how truly awful they are. In addition to all of the above (which makes it super uncomfortable to get work done on a computer), they enforce an absurd Ryanair-style 18 lbs carry-on size limit coupled with dimension limits that fit toy bags. Despite me explaining that in my reasonably sized standard carryon (which was under 20 lbs) I am carrying bare essentials to keep my special needs 4-year old manageable for a 24-hour trip and that this was the only carryon bag for three paying passengers combined, they made me empty everything into what was essentially one grocery-sized plastic bag: passports, diapers, medications, sleeping needs, children books, toddler food, water, one change of kid clothes 〞 everything in one jumble. With this Hansel and Gretel type bag of overstuffed chaos I proceeded through several airports and planes courtesy of LH while my essentially empty carryon traveled checked in and the overhead bins were empty as well. The same farce was repeated on the way back, with the added twist that the plane experienced a technical defect that caused a 2.5 hour delay for which they issued us 〞 after the late flight had boarded 〞 10 EUR meal vouchers which wouldn＊t have been good for anything anyway since the US bound flight section had only one counter which had quickly run out of food. They also forbade the use of an FAA approved seat belt for my child on all flights, citing German regulations. LH is now strictly back in the banned category for me. I get that all of these things might have been in some conditions of carriage that I accepted by buying the LH ticket. Fine.

Reason given: ""Waiting for passengers from a connecting flight"" - Landed in Munich when the connecting flight LH1650 to Bucharest was already boarding - No staff at the gate to expedite transfer to connecting flight - While making my way to the gate got message that I had been re-booked for another flight 6 and a half hours later - Flight LH1650 was therefore not delayed to ""wait for passengers from a connecting flight"" - Lufthansa Start Alliance Service Desk in Munich terminal K was not able to help with re-booking on an earlier direct flight. The only options presented were to take another connecting flight with a short (and risky) layover through Frankfurt or Belgrade. - Lufthansa Start Alliance Service Desk in Munich terminal K was not able to offer a reasonable or informative reason why some flights are delayed to wait for passengers and others are not. The answer they gave was: ""I don't know, this decision isn't made here. Could be any number of reasons."" - Lufthansa Start Alliance Service Desk in Munich terminal K also not able to offer any complimentary service (e.g. access to lounge, ticket to Munich to see the city, some sort of entertainment, or even more basic water or food) for the 6 and a half hours delay that I am forced to be here. - Feedback from does not pick up my Miles and More details even though I am logged in as I complete this form. It does for the bookings but not for the feedback. Consequences: - Anger for being treated differently than the passengers for which my flight was delayed departing out of Zurich - Wasted time: 6 and a half hours in Munich airport - Wasted money in the airport - Stress and frustration of having to re-book all plans for the day. I will have lost 6 and a half hours in which I had other appointments at the destination. - Frustration for not being given any reasonable or informative information or alternative flights at the Lufthansa Star Alliance Service Desk - Suspect the reason why my details are not picked up on the feedback form is because of lack of interest in gathering feedback. - Frustration and anger for having to waste even more time to fill out forms and leave reviews to be heard instead of being treated with empathy by a human at the service desk. - Dissapointment for having been forcefully put through this experience Question I now ask myself: Why do I have a Miles & More membership and will often pay more to book with member airlines? Conclusion: when flying Lufthansa with Star Alliance - Connection of 45 minutes are not enough for a transfer between member airline flights - Flights may or may not wait for passengers from connecting flights. It is unknown how this choice is made. - Passengers will not be treated like a human with empathy but like a number with a ticket in a queue - In case of delayed arrival there will be no effort made to expedite transfer to the connecting flight. - Service desk staff don't have the training/ courtesy/ means to offer adequate information or complimentary services, and lack the basic people skills for customer service: patience, problem-solving, empathy, adaptability. - In case deemed necessary by the system you will be automatically re-booked with no warning, advice, or choice. - Lufthansa with Star Alliance does not equal more reliable travel experience or better service.",negative,-0.780952,0,71,10.475653,7.432484

Firstly, the lack of children's headphones has caused additional inconvenience during the flight, especially for parents who want to provide comfort for their children. Furthermore, the airline's promised gift remained just a promise, which caused disappointment for both us and our children. Secondly, the children's meal was far from ideal. Not only did the quality leave something to be desired, but the selection was also extremely limited. This created additional difficulties for parents trying to accommodate the tastes of their little passengers. Overall, my experience with this airline was anything but pleasant. The insufficient attention to children and their needs greatly spoiled the impression of the flight. I do not recommend this airline to families with children who are looking for a pleasant trip.

By re-booking we were assigned to the 2 middle seats in the third row with no privacy at all! The service was good, and the food was ok. The cabin, entertainment system and seats were outdated and worn out. Arrived at Buenos Aires and got to hear that our luggage had not arrived. Needless to say, we felt miserable.

Throughout this ordeal, the group was stranded with no Lufthansa staff around to provide assistance and no contacts.  Amidst the chaos, desperate attempts to secure accommodation proved futile as nearby hotels were fully booked. With no alternatives, the stranded passengers resorted to spending the night on uncomfortable airport chairs. Next morning we went to Departure Checkin Counter. LH Staff on duty could not offer any explanation. LH could not offer us any room to washup and rest, but offered a meal voucher value 17.

At least budget airlines know how to get people on and off efficiently. Also, leaving Germany apparently one must complete a second passport check. This was not announced or explained by the airline, people were just expected to know they had to go to a separate counter to get a weird little sticker put on their passport. The reason was not given, and when I asked the Lufthansa staff member he got very defensive and shouted BREXIT at me - as though this very unusual process was completely explained by this single word.

The first thing that struck us upon entering the aircraft was how old it is. After an hour and a half, we were told we had to return to Frankfurt due to a defective engine. Various announcements from the crew attempted to reassure us and assure that someone would take care of our onward flights. In the last announcement, it was said that the app would solve everything, and we could manage our onward journey there. But as you know, the app doesn't work. Arrival in Frankfurt on the tarmac: We had to wait about 15 minutes for the bus to reach the terminal, then go through passport control back to the check-in area and for the first time, take a number and wait... After several discussions, I was ""lucky"" to be rebooked on a later flight. My question: Is this how a frequent flyer is treated? Are there no interim solutions in the transit area or in a lounge for Senator customers? The Flight: 05.04.2024, LH 432 from FRA to ORD, Business Class, Seat 3K. When I boarded, I thought the last plane was old, but this Airbus 340 was even older, over 26 years in service. This is also how one can describe the condition of the cabin, which I experienced firsthand at seat 3K. The seat was broken and could not be properly secured. A technician and the purser examined the seat and came to a common conclusion: ""The only thing to do is to saw it off."" Since the flight was full, I had no choice but to sit in such a seat for over 8 hours. My question: If safety is so important at Lufthansa and it is always checked whether one is fastened, then why are you allowed to fly in such a seat?

The Business Class flight from Birmingham to Frankfurt was fine. On arrival at Frankfurt I was met and escorted to the First Class lounge Terminal 1. The lounge was a perfect to place to spend a 5 hour layover. It was uncrowded with excellent service, food selection and drink. On my return to Frankfurt, I was escorted to the First Class Terminal which was of the same quality, as was the SIA First Lounge, which I used prior to my return flight. Also, I enjoyed the treat of Porsche rides to the aircraft. Onboard I was impressed with the high level of attentive service. It was a particular pleasure to be welcomed by the Chief Pursers on both flights - Natalie and Andrea. Andrea kindly spent about 10 minutes sorting out my phone to accept the free onboard WiFi. As both flights were late night departures I was mainly interested in sleeping rather than eating. But the food I did have was good and well presented and I enjoyed the cooked breakfasts of scrambled egg and smoked salmon cooked to order. My seat was very comfortable and I had a few hours sleep when it was converted to a cosy bed. I suppose the TV screen was a bit on the small size, but that was not a problem for me. So overall very pleasant flights with the superb lounges probably the stand out feature, but generally no complaints at all and I would be happy to fly again with Lufthansa First Class.",positive,0.717988,0,71,10.475653,7.432484

I have absolutely not cancelled the ticket online, nor did I ever receive any communication from the company saying that the return was cancelled, so it must be a mistake from your end.

They told me to call the Lufthansa Call Center, who told me to call Lufthansa Internet Service Center, which, of course, was whom I called in the first place! I spoke with a lady who endlessly insisted that the return ticket was refunded to me (it was not! Only the airport taxes were!) and as such I had no more rights on my ticket whatsoever). This stunt has cost me some 400, including the ticket that I lost and the new ticket I had to buy. However, what shocked me the most was not that Lufthansa has adopted (and refined) the worst commercial practices of the worst low-cost companies.

? Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Colombo,23-Dec,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," I recently had an incredibly disheartening experience with Lufthansa, and I feel compelled to share my ordeal to warn fellow travelers about the serious issues I encountered. My journey with this airline was marked by delays, missed connections, baggage mishandling, and subpar service. Flight Delays and Missed Connecting Flight: My scheduled flight was plagued by repeated delays, causing a domino effect that ultimately led to missing my connecting flight. The lack of communication and transparency during these delays left passengers like myself feeling frustrated and stranded. The impact on my travel plans was significant, and the subsequent attempts to reorganize my itinerary were met with unhelpful and indifferent responses from the airline staff. Baggage Woes - Not Once, but Twice: To compound the already distressing situation, my checked suitcases were not loaded onto the flight not once, but twice. The first instance could be considered an unfortunate mistake, but the recurrence of this issue raises serious concerns about the airline's operational reliability. The inconvenience of arriving at my destination without essential belongings is simply unacceptable, and the lack of a proactive solution from the airline further exacerbated the problem. Subpar Service: Throughout the entire journey, the service provided by Lufthansa Airline was nothing short of disappointing. From unhelpful staff during delays to the apparent lack of a well-executed baggage handling system, it became evident that customer satisfaction was not a priority for this airline. The attitude of the staff members was indifferent, bordering on disrespectful, further adding to the negative experience. In conclusion, my experience with Lufthansa Airline was a complete letdown. The accumulation of flight delays, missed connections, baggage mishandling (repeatedly), and poor service has left me with a resolute decision never to use this airline again. I hope this review serves as a cautionary tale for those considering travel with Lufthansa. There are undoubtedly more reliable and customer-focused options available, and I strongly advise against choosing this airline for your travel needs.",negative,-0.815041,0,70,10.475653,7.432484

Trip Verified ,A320/321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Warsaw,24-Jan,4,4,1,,,3,2,no,6," Well, to say that this particular flight from Frankfurt to Warsaw and back was a disaster would be an enormous exaggeration as I was punctually brought to my target destination, nevertheless I'm not fully satisfied with it. To be honest, it's quite unfair from Lufthansa's side to provide a service similar to a low-cost carrier but to set prices and to advertise themselves as a premium airline. As for now Lufthansa has learned all the ""tricks"" from the arsenal of an average LCC to limit the options for a passenger and hence to have a possibility to make everything payable, e.g. no included checked luggage (well, that's the only thing I support as many passengers don't need to have and to pay for this option), no free seat selection, a very limited meal service on board (a small bottle of water and one chocolate bar). They even managed to bring a calibrator to the gate and to measure the size of hand luggage and that looked really miserable. What made me especially angry is this ""boarding by groups"" which means if you randomly get a seat that belongs to ""group 5"" you will need to wait up to 40 mins in the queue. The announcements about which group is currently boarding are barely hearable so you have to keep your attention and to wait near the gate for quite a long time. Another unpleasant thing that should be avoided was that both times in Frankfurt the aircraft was positioned in the remote corners of the airfield so we had an ""exciting"" long trip to the plane in a cramped bus. I admit that there could be technical reasons for doing that, but it looks like more ""uh, it's just Warsaw, not Zurich or London, the public flying to this destination is not so demanding so we can provide a mediocre service and nobody will complain"". When I take a LCC flight I can fully accept all these issues because the low price justifies them, but it's not an excuse for Lufthansa. I have never taken the long-haul LH flights and I can believe that the situation is better there, but on European destinations I consider Lufthansa to be not fully competent and I tend not to choose it in the future.",negative,-0.844955,0,71,10.475653,7.432484

I＊ve had a return trip from Dubai to Amsterdam via Munich with Lufthansa. That was my first time flying LH and I thought they used to have a good reputation. The trip began with the 3hrs delay from Dubai. After arriving to Munich there was no person to connect the bridge to the plane and let people disembark. Since I missed my connection I was rebooked on the last flight available that day. Again, the boarding was delayed because they couldn＊t find a crew member. That part still leaves me speechless. Finally our flight departed with people sitting on their bags due to lack of storage compartments. That was more like a scene from a bus in the suburbs, rather than the safe environment up to aviation standards. On the way back from Amsterdam of course the flight was delayed as the inbound flight landed late. I also got to learn that the airline is saving costs on cutting the ground staff. There was 2 check in desks where *priority* passengers could get assistance. The remaining peasants checked in their luggage by themselves and pray for it to actually make it to the plane. After another couple of delays on both of my flights we got welcomed by the crew member who didn＊t even bother to pretend like she was there to assist people. I did her job helping people around me to find space for their luggage, while she was standing there and yelling that we need to take it to the front. Her charming personality then continued glowing throughout the flight when she would keep knocking people＊s heads with her elbows and pretending she didn＊t notice. Kicking passengers personal belongings under the seats with her feet was also very welcoming. This wasn＊t even the end of it. The cherry on the cake is that after finally arriving to Dubai I received an email stating that they lost my suitcase. Here＊s where I also learn that there＊s no customer support team or anyone to follow up with, as of course, that would mean paying people salaries. There＊s no phone or email communication from Lufthansa. You do get a wonderful chat bot option which is basically talking to yourself. Now it＊s been 2 days and they don＊t even know in which country my suitcase is, and there＊s no one to even do the job of trying to locate it.

How wrong we were! Our whole experience, which is still ongoing, five months later, ruined our holiday of a lifetime. It started before we had even left home for the airport, when I tried to book inflight diabetic meals for my husband. This has never been an issue with other airlines but, although Lufthansa offers eleven choices of meals, these do not include a diabetic option. Even at the airport, their staff couldn＊t find the option for us. The stewardess kindly put a note on my husband＊s records, asking for the said meal on the return flight but this didn＊t happen.  On landing at Windhoek, we found that one of our suitcases had not arrived.  We queued with others to report the missing case and completed the form derived by their QR code. I received an email confirming the loss and promising an update within 24 hours. I am still waiting for it. We now had to go into a city we didn＊t know; find a shopping centre, we didn＊t know, and then find shops to replace essential items, including my husband＊s medication.  During our stay in Namibia, Lufthansa repeatedly changed our return flight times, the details of which were emailed to me and I had to confirm within a certain time frame. No allowance was made for the fact we were in a country with very poor Internet coverage. At times I couldn＊t even get reception on my mobile phone. So, when we arrived back in Windhoek, to catch our flight home, I found their email cancelling our seats, as I had missed one of their emails.  On using Lufthansa＊s webchat, to rebook our return flights, we were told our flights had been cancelled because of industrial action at London Heathrow. When trying to claim compensation, after our return home, we were told the flight was cancelled: because of bad weather in Windhoek and the plane couldn＊t land and when I emailed them that we were already in Windhoek and the weather was fine, we were then told the weather was bad at the airport the plane was flying out of to get to Windhoek. Eventually we received compensation for the so called cancelled flights.

Lufthansa installs new baggage processing equipment every 3-5 years for whatever reason. The new system scanned our boarding card and did not print the baggage ticket for us to be able to check in the luggage. Then we went to the counter to perform the same process manually. Guess what the new baggage processing machine got stuck this time and was not able to process the luggage. Had to wait 20 mins for someone to come and manually solve the problem.  Nevertheless, we thought that should be it we can fly and not worry about the luggage but it was too soon for us to calm down. We land at the destination and our luggage is not there. So, if you have problem with this new ""automatic"" baggage submission process which in turn results in manual problem solution and baggage delay till at least the next flight. Unnecessary and too much automatization of something that already worked well and no real solution when the new system fails and that is on top of a Ryanair like flight experience in a travel of nearly 5 hours with sandwich and no entertainment on board.

I was excited to get a first look at Boeing 747-8 and thought seating on the double Decker would be fun! Alas! Who knew seating 'higher up' does not mean elevated experience. The business class seats at the upper deck are similar to down below, except it's 2-2 instead of 2-2-2 due to narrower space. The design of this business class (including lower deck) works for a couple but for people flying in business, does not make much sense. There are ample of holes if you are seating on the window seats but none for the passenger seating in the aisle seats. The seat was ok, it reclined fully and did it's job. I may have gotten a few hours sleep. The worst part was the screen and video. The touch screen barely worked. The remote was slow but did work, however, the screen resolution is worst than older box TV. The noise canceling headphone did cancel noise but every time there was turbulence, it made weird sound.

I have submitted my feedback to Lufthansa, and for this I have received a copy-pasted template response that have denied my request to compensation when I have not made or implied this request any at any point. Lufthansa made it clear that the comfort experience was as-intended by the company. The crux of the issue was lack of upper body ergonomics in the seats - while there was decent legroom provided, there was no way to rest my upper body without disturbing the passengers next to me, no matter how I tried to contort and what sitting poses I would pick. At its root, there is just not enough space between you and the forward seat ahead when it is reclined (which it will be on a long transatlantic flight!), the arm rests were useless, the angles between your body and seats/walls were uncomfortable, and the seating surface was just a bit too short.  Additionally, the in-flight entertainment gets a low rating due to brightness issue compounded by lack of space - if the IFE screen is off, any time you try to move in your seat you will bump against it... at which point the screen comes back on at default brightness. This means it'll shine bright in your face and disturb people around you many-many times over on a dark flight. The default brightness is extremely bright for a dark flight condition when everyone is trying to sleep, and there seemed to be no way to make the IFE remember the brightness level. I did not use IFE for its intended entertainment purpose, so I cannot rate the media contents. The second short flight using A321neo was just OK. It provided the basic level of comfort, but was nothing to write home about.

I was originally booked to fly from London City Airport to Frankfurt on the mid-morning flight but the inbound aircraft could not land due to dense fog at that time and the aircraft was eventually diverted to Gatwick after several go-arounds, so my flight as cancelled at the very last minute (when all passengers were waiting at the gate to board). There appeared to be only 2 Lufthansa ground staff at London City airport managing this flight and the senior member was unfriendly (she was borderline rude to some passengers who were understandably worried about delays leading to missed connections in Frankfurt) but her colleague was much more sympathetic. I bypassed them both in the end by reaching out to Lufthansa using their web chat on my phone internet whilst still at the airport gate, and was rebooked on to a later flight from London Heathrow airport, though the web agent had to wait for the Lufthansa computer system to ※officially§ recognise that my original flight had indeed been cancelled (which took a few minutes). I was then rebooked and checked-in automatically and my new boarding pass emailed to me immediately. I appreciated that I had automatically been allocated an aisle seat on my new flight, as I had paid for an aisle seat for my original flight. So basically the web chat agent had been very helpful. After that I was reliant on the Lufthansa ground staff to walk us (all affected passengers) back to ※land-side§ from ※airside§ of the airport.

I felt like I was playing a guessing game with my own belongings. But the real kicker? When I reached out for compensation, they dared to respond with, ""According to our record, the baggage irregularity happened at your home airport. Please understand that we cannot comply with your compensation request under these circumstances."" Seriously? So not only did they lose my bags, but they also refused to take responsibility for their mistake! Now, let's talk about customer service. If you've ever wondered what it's like to deal with unhelpful, indifferent, and unresponsive staff, Lufthansa has you covered. They've taken a crash course in making customers feel like a burden. Oh, and the fun doesn't stop there. Last year, I had the ""pleasure"" of going through the same ordeal with Lufthansa's baggage mishandling. You'd think they'd have learned from their mistakes, but nope, they're consistent in their incompetence.

Contacting Lufthansa, I was informed that it was too late to cancel the flight. Despite our numerous attempts to resolve the issue, the customer service representatives seemed uninterested in assisting, consistently deflecting responsibility. We sought resolution through Amex, but our efforts were futile due to a lack of proof for the original call.  Upon arrival at the airport, we encountered further frustration. Lufthansa's representatives continued evading responsibility, resulting in no resolution.  Ultimately, my wife and I were left traveling with four seats, a predicament that was entirely avoidable.

When I emailed them with all my bills for the hotel, restaurant, and taxi expenses, I received a response stating that they had discontinued this method and provided other instructions for claiming my refund. Unsure of how to proceed and having received no response to my initial ticket, I attempted all the options described in the email. Unfortunately, nothing happened for about a month. I then searched for the customer support line number and called them, only to find out that instead of asking for a refund, you need to provide feedback in Lufthansa's process. After a little over two months, I finally learned how to request a refund. Things seemed positive as they requested information, and I provided everything they needed. Following that, they requested my bank details for registration, but since then, I've received no response. I contacted customer support, was told to wait since it hadn't been three months yet, and so I did. Now, over 6 months since my flight, I still haven't received any information about when I'll get the refund.

By the way, contacting this department is only possible via email, not through customer support or yourself. Regardless, I got a bit angry today because I haven't received anything, not even an email saying they're working on it.

You call luggage services, they literally said this ""That's your mistake, you have to give us a reference number"", yeah but you guys gave me a wrong reference number & that's what I am calling to figure out, they literally say ""that's still your mistake & we gave you the answer"".

A report of the loss of the bag was made at Montreal Airport on 25/7.

Sometimes they say that the delivery of the bag has been confirmed by the courier and you received it, another call the bag is on the way by courier, and the last call was very funny as they say the bag arrived at Montreal airport, but the delivery status is unknown on the system. My city is very far from Montreal airport is about 952 Km driving by car or 1:20 hour by airplane, so I asked them to share any contact such as email or phone number for Lufthansa Montreal office so I can communicate and check with my bag, but the call center says we don＊t have any contact for Montreal airport.

Went to the airport with 3 pieces, to be met by quite an incompetent staff working for Lufthansa telling me it's a website mistake, you only have two pieces of luggage not 4, so it is your responsibility to pay for the 3rd piece or we don't accept the luggage. Pointless argument for next 45 minutes, with all sort of excuses, none of which answers the most basic question, if we even accept that your website is wrong for the most basic information, why is that something that I should fix rather than the airline, the answer is simply from Lufthansa ""pay now & dispute with your credit card company"", I never heard this even from low cost charter airlines which to be fair they actually have better customer than the non existing customer service of Lufthansa. I paid $100 dollars for the luggage. Eventually on arrival they say sorry we only put 2 out of 3 luggage on the flight, 6 days & no luggage & no nothing.

The plane was delayed in New York JFK for a little over 2 hours. When we arrived in Munich, we were first told that we have to be rebooked because we won't make our connection. Then just before landing, we were told that we will make our connection but we have to run to the new gate. One of the flight attendants was asking us what time does the cruise ship depart from Athens? Just before landing in Athens Airport, they announced over the intercom that none of our luggage was on the plane and that we should go to the luggage help desk in Athens and file a report for missing luggage. Now I understood why they asked the question about the departure of our cruise ship. When I spoke to the flight attendant about that, she said it was not their decision, but that it was ""ground operation"" that decided not to wait for the luggage so they don't miss the flight window. Instead they decided to inconvenience over 50 people, including 7 in my family who are going on a cruise without a hair brush, a pair of underwear or an article of clothing. We were on line for over 2 hours at the luggage desk to fill the forms of missing luggage. It was a nightmare trying to function on the cruise or enjoying any activities without any of our belongings. Six days later we received our luggage in Cyprus. The largest airline in Europe should be embarrassed by such callousness of their employees in Munich. We spent most of our time buying clothes and personal effects instead of enjoying the activities on the cruise ship.

Upon check-in, I was assigned a specific seat, but upon reaching the aircraft, I was given a completely different seat. Worse yet, another passenger claimed the same seat, leading to an awkward situation. This confusion was eventually resolved, but not without causing unnecessary anxiety. The most distressing part of my journey was the mishandling of my luggage. Due to the flight delay, my luggage missed the connecting flight, and I was forced to fill out a form to provide details about my belongings. The subsequent emails I received from Lufthansa were inconsistent and misleading. First, I was informed that my luggage was found and would be delivered, but the next day, I received another email stating that you still couldn't locate my delayed baggage. I am deeply dissatisfied with the reimbursement policy for essential items like clothing and personal items.

The plane left Toulouse over an hour late, which made us miss the flight from Munich to Montreal. We had to wait 4h in line to get the tickets for the hotel/cab + plane tickets for the next available flight (24h later) to Montreal. The next day we got into the plane, the plane was nasty. I tried putting my bottle of water in the compartment in front of my seat and as I reached to put it I touched used, humid Kleenex from the previous passengers. I was about to take a picture of it when the stewardess saw me and changed our seats. The new seats we＊re as nasty as the previous one, coffee stains on the table, visible old journals in the compartment, hairs on the other table, etc. That was at the time when Airlines companies were supposed to clean the planes very well in between flights (for obvious COVID reasons), we we＊re also still required to wear a mask at all times. Two days after my arrival, I wrote a complaint and asked for the legal compensation for the missed flight (over 24h forced stay in Munich) and I also complained about the dirty plane, asking for a supervisor to call me. I did not receive and calls, only a weird email asking me for my banking information, which I replied to saying I wasn＊t comfortable giving this information that way. It took 5 months (November 2022) before I received another email stating that it was a safe way to give my information through the website. I did send my banking information through the website shortly after that, reiterating that I also wanted to receive a call from a supervisor. I didn＊t receive any calls nor any compensation whatsoever. I tried contacting the customer service department a couple of times, they would either hang up on me or make me wait for hours until the line would magically cut. At one point I was able to speak to someone, who confirmed to me it could take a couple months for me to receive something. Its been over a year now, I still haven＊t received the call, I warned them that I would file a complaint to the OTC, asked them to settle this with me before, they didn＊t reach out to me. I filled the complaint, still wrote to them that I was willing to settle it in a friendly way but they still refuse to call me.

The India flights were, rather surprisingly, alright, and the Japan one less so. But my problem is not with the flights themselves, but rather with Lufthansa's frequent flyer programme ('miles & more'), which is simply atrocious. First of all, there is no possibility anywhere of interacting with a human being. For some reason, the flight mileage is seemingly arbitrary. Whereas my daughter and I flew together, she got no mileage for two of her four flights and I got nothing for one (a different) sector. How do you fix this? Well, you go to their website and scan in your boarding pass and submit the request. You get a cryptic (by that I mean idiotic) ""reply"" but you cannot reply to that and ask for a clarification! All you can do is to redo the same thing you just did. Secondly, I just tried looking to see how much credit I could get with my miles towards a ticket for my kids. How do you do this? Well, you login to the miles & more website and ask for a flight on the dates of interest. Back a message saying that unfortunately no tickets are available for the dates requested, but perhaps changing the dates might help, alongside a helpful link back to the previous page, instead of showing you a grill with availability on dates a week before or after. So you go back to the previous page and has it kept your data? Of course not! They clearly do not want you to use your mileage.

Passengers were not segregated according to class and it was almost a free for all. The ground staff was extremely rude.

I missed a step when I was originally booking online and I ended up booking my seat from Barcelona to Munich and not from Munich to Vancouver. I was willing to pay for my seat.  I didn＊t have roaming on my phone so I used my friends phone. I googled how to reach Lufthansa from Spain. I couldn＊t call their 1800 customer service number because it didn＊t work from Spain. I googled everything from what area codes to use from Spain to call Lufthansa using a Canadian phone. Well let me tell you with all this technology these companies have they don＊t make it easy on the customer. It＊s not enough we have us do all the work ourselves when booking tickets and checking in, but its hard reaching customer service when you need them. Their online system is not user friendly and when it tells you to contact Lufthansa directly, but they don＊t offer you a phone number let alone a number for calling from Spain or other foreign countries even though they have offices in these countries. After I managed to find their number on Google and it said it was Lufthansa＊s number I ended up calling the Barcelona Airport. Finally, I did reach Lufthansa＊s offices in Madrid. This woman picked it up and she was speaking in Spanish. I asked her if anybody there speaks English because I know no Spanish. As soon as I said that her attitude changed. She kept telling me that she didn＊t speak English. I asked if some else there did? She said nobody. I told her all I wanted to do was book my seat, but she kept telling me to call this old number that didn＊t exist because I had tried it. The irony was this woman kept speaking to me in full English sentences, but then she would say I don＊t speak English? She would say ※Sir you have to call this number for help§ ※Sir nobody speaks English here not even my colleagues§ ※Sir we have no manager here to help you§ I told her that her English was fine & that she was speaking to me in full English sentences.  I was pleading with her to help me.  I got my friend to call her & talk to her in Spanish, and she told my friend that she couldn＊t book our seats & to wait till we got to the airport. She told my friend that all the seats were booked. The next morning when we arrived at Barcelona Airport we checked in at the Lufthansa counter. We told this agent what the woman on the phone told us about there being no seats available and he couldn＊t understand why she would say that because he said there were many seats available.

I had a much better travel experience during my last couple of flights with low-cost airlines than during my last 8 or so Lufthansa flights. There seem to be barely any LH flights that leave and arrive on time. In the last week, I took five LH flights and every single one of them was delayed. At this occasion we were told that the crew arrived late and needed to have a briefing and, in addition there were no baggage handlers available. So, we finally took off 40 mins late. I specifically booked a seat in the first row because I have rather long legs and got my boarding pass only to find out during boarding that LH changed my seat and I was bumped back a few rows. As there was no change pf aircraft, there must have been somebody more ※important§ than I which is not a good feeling. (I would have not even said anything if they put some seniors or people with special needs there but the people they put into my booked seat were some intoxicated rich youngsters.) So much about recognising loyalty which doesn＊t seem to have a significant role in Lufthansa＊s playbook anymore. Food portions were so small that I thought the airline handed out an appetizer before lunch only to find out later that this was actually the meal. Over the last years the food at LH got worse and worse and the portions are constantly getting smaller. The food was beetroot and some inedible celery salat with some cold meat cuts (no idea what kind of meat). Being German myself, I do know that beetroot and celery is part of the diet in some parts of the country, but I just don＊t see why people of cultural backgrounds other the German would eat this. I suppose the food in Business was not worth more than about 3 Euros. There is no free food or drink service in Economy at all, The only thing Lufthansa is giving out for free for all customers is a piece of cheap chocolate and an apple (no joke). So, here＊s the ※verdict§: With Lufthansa it is not worth paying extra for premium seats, at least not on short or medium distance flights. There is no free food or drink service in Exonomy Class Loyalty recognition is non-existent. Food is terrible and comes in ※appetiser§ portions only. I can＊t see why anyone would pay extra for no extra service unless one wants a free apple and an appetiser (but for the extra price of the premium ticket, one can buy 20 kilos of apple plus one or two bottles of champagne)",negative,-0.756889,0,70,10.475653,7.432484

I am still paying the price, for my unforgettable mistake of booking flights LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo on March 22, 2023, and LH717 from Tokyo to Frankfurt on April 17, 2023. To start, one of our bags was delayed for more than five (5) days, and the airline's customer service at the Frankfurt Airport was unhelpful in resolving the issue. Despite spending over an hour discussing the problem, we received no information about the status of our bags, and they seemed indifferent to our inconvenience. Thankfully, a service agent who overheard our conversation, and helped us establishing the status of the missing bag. Furthermore, Lufthansa's reimbursement policy for the toiletries and clothing was unclear and unsatisfactory. We were informed after the fact via email that Lufthansa only refunds 100% of the toiletry items and 50% of the clothing, we had to purchase in Frankfurt and at the airport before our departure to Japan. Although we filed the expense reports with corresponding copies of the receipts on April 27th, we have been receiving daily emails stating that they cannot issue reimbursements due to the lack of receipts, which were originally filed. This has been a frustrating experience and has resulted in repeated filings of the same receipts. During our return trip from Tokyo, we were assigned a seat in the lower deck of the business class section, which was broken, making the 11-hour and 40-minute flight extremely uncomfortable. When we brought this to the attention of the head flight attendant, she was apologetic, but did not offer any solution other than the manual manipulation of the seat, every time we needed to change its position. To our surprise, two members of what we believe was an orchestra seated in the upper deck of the business class section with their cellos strapped into chairs next to them. Instead, we had to manually manipulate the seat every time we needed to change positions.

My family and I were so excited to visit Venice for the first time, and booked an April 1 departure flight from Hong Kong though Frankfurt with Lufthansa.  Firstly, they canceled my outbound flight just a few days before without automatically rebooking me on an equivalent flight (incredibly, they just removed the segment from my itinerary), with just a discrete email sent to me. I felt myself lucky that I checked my email a day before going to the airport and realized what had happened. As their on-line rebooking system was completely useless (ie. they had simply removed the cancel flight segment without a trace from my itinerary, and so the on-line system could not even find it to rebook.). After 30 minutes of frustration with their useless chatbot, I called into their customer service line, and then the next 90 minutes of pain really started. I tried both their local HK and German hot lines, with a reasonable wait each time, but each time a few minutes into the call, the line would simply cut off. This happened whenever they put me on hold, and sometimes at other random times also. After trying both mobile and land lines at my end, I realized this was probably Lufthansa's IT system issue which the agents seem obvious to. In the next calls, I had to beg the agent to call me back if the line dropped so that they could complete the rebooking transaction. None did for about 10 tries! The Asia-line call center was particularly horrible, as the agent was incredibly rude and evasive, trying to argue immediately that Lufthansa had no responsibility to handle the case as the original ticket as booked through an on-line agent (I booked through Booking.com, whom I had already call. They indicated the Airline was the only one who could make the booking change). Incredibly the agent spent about 3 minutes tried to find every opportunity to evade instead of just solving the problem, and eventually the line dropped (or perhaps he just hung up on me!). Incredible that Lufthansa hires people like this for customer service.  That night, after nearly 90 minutes of trying, I finally got someone on the German call center who was kind enough to call be back after the system dropped the call. She said she rebooked me on a KLM flight that departed half a day earlier and despite the horrible experience, I thought I was saved! Next day, a Friday, my family (4 of us) rushed to the airport to catch the new flight. We had to pull both of our kids out of school a few hours early, and I left work early as the new flight departed mid-day Friday, instead of the original we booked which was early AM Saturday, just after midnight.

Entering the plane, there was no space at all to place a hand luggage in the cabin overhead bin. That was because all the passengers had already placed there not only their hand luggage but also their plus 1 items, jackets, etc. I informed a flight attendant about this, she apologetically told me ""I know but now it is difficult to fix this"", an attitude I respected although the problem was not fixed. A bit later, another flight attendant tried to ""help"" me however he was not even able to place my small plus 1 item in the cabin bag. Then, I told him again that there are numerous bags in the overhead bin that should not be placed there and they should be moved underneath the seat so that the 55cm luggage can fit. He just started lying to me about the weight of the hand luggage, claiming that both items should weigh up to 8kg (which is a cheap lie according to the official website of Lufthansa) and everyone has done the same here. That is rudeness at a different level, I've never encountered anything like that because flight attendants are super polite and helpful typically (1st time flying with Lufthansa though, maybe that's the problem here). He also claimed that the laptop bag is typically to be used in the overhead bin and the 55cm underneath the seat, that sounded so ridiculous. All in all, instead of trying to help a customer who apparently has paid so that he is able to travel with a decent sense of comfort (without having to place his feet between a 55cm luggage on the floor while keeping the laptop bag at hand during the entire flight), the flight attendant tried to blame a passenger for his own shortcomings being unable to arrange a correct baggage placement in the aircraft! I have NEVER seen such an attitude by a flight attendant in so many flights I've been present. To the contrary, all flight attendants typically rearrange the luggage and try to solve any problem so that everyone can fly in a decent setting.

Told to head to the service desk to see what was next, especially since a lot of people including us had missed their connection flight. The queue was huge and the very helpful help desk closed at 0000 before most people could get any information. A tannoy announcement came over saying they could not provide any hotels, but people could either get a hotel and then claim it back or were welcome to stay at the airport, on the floor, and check on the flights at 0600 the next day. No substantial food was offered. A twix and juice carton was provided to substitute the missed meal. We opted to go for a hotel as we had young children. Unfortunately the taxi queue was also huge! To make things worse it was outside in the snow, and well into the minus numbers. What turned this experience from awlful to utterly ridiculous was that we had barely any warm clothes as our final destination was South Africa in the summer. We had to wait an hour before we could get a taxi. We were not allowed to collect our baggage which we may have been able to add a few more layers, as it had been transferred to the flight tomorrow. Or so the tannoy said. We were unable to confirm this, as previously mentioned, the help desk closed. I checked on the app and it did appear that we were on the same flight the following day. I was unable to reserve seats to ensure we were sat together as the flight was less than 24 hours away, but that was a task for tomorrow. That morning I discovered that I had in fact been kicked off that re-booking. According to the app I had now reached my final destination and so the seats were now vacant and booked by someone else. I attempted to use the app, online portal, the live chat and calling up the help line number, none of these could help and told me I had to go the the service desk in the airport. I then spent from 0945 till 1205 in a queue to speak to one of the 5 people working in the service help centre (I was number 3538 and when I got there it was at 3342) there were 12 desks for attendants to work from, but Lufthansa decided that the queue trailing the length of the airport only justified half filling those positions. Finally I was told that it was a glitch in the system and that there was nothing they could do about it but would book me in for the following day. So me and my family had to spend another day in mid winter with no warm clothing. Luckily the there was no issues with the next flight, except that our laggage was temporarily missplaced. We did manage to recover it and headed out for our holiday thinking that the worse was behind us. This was just the outward journey. The I was informed on 4pm the day before the flight home. It had been cancelled! I spent 4 hours on hold to get in touch with the ever-so-helpful Lufthansa online chat number 372 in queue!

Instead of resorting to this option I decided to call and get rebooked to a United flight from a different city (Newark). I called the number provided in the cancellation of my flight email from Lufthansa, but the person I spoke with was a third-party agent and unfamiliar with their job. I had to give them step by step instructions on how to proceed - and their incompetence totally screwed us up on our return. The night before my flight I could not check in as our return tickets were not being recognized. I spent hours of time with a United customer service agent. The agent eventually booked our seats assignments, but when I reached the airport we could not check in! We then had to go to the counter and the agent there had to fix our tickets as my husband wasn't even listed as a passenger. She told us that this was Lufthansa's fault for not entering proper code data. If we hadn't had seat assignments we would have missed our flight. After flying both Lufthansa and United, I can say United is better. This is shocking to me as previously Lufthansa was far superior but their standards have drastically changed. The food is bad, the entertainment selection is mediocre, and worse the seats are horrible! The only positive is the staff was friendly.

When customers book flights, they are entering an agreement (typically an expensive one) with the airline. In our case, we upheld our side of the bargain and Lufthansa consistently failed to uphold their end of the bargain. Never mind ※unable to provide you with the excellent service you expect§ - this was well below ※does not meet expectations§. Our Journey from Hell - STEP 1: We originally were set to leave Dallas to Frankfurt for a connecting flight (both Lufthansa) to Toulouse. For reasons outside of our control/not related to weather, the plane was delayed. We chose to try to make our connecting flight instead of rebooking after speaking to the person at the front desk. We spent the entire 9 hour flight stressed about whether we＊d make it in time. STEP 2: Our connecting flight was delayed - pretty on brand and a trend that would continue for the rest of our journey. At first we thought it was our lucky day, we sprinted across the entire first floor of Terminal A and up 5 flights of stairs to get to our terminal. WE MADE IT AS THEY WERE STILL BOARDING! We did everything in our control as the customer to be there, yet alas - as we presented our boarding passes, the attendant realized they had given away our seats to standby passengers that were standing right next to us. He pulled us aside, and as we were waiting for him to check our tickets, they continued to let other passengers board. We were finally told they only had 1 more seat left and moved us to the next flight which was a total of 6 hours later (plot-twist: you guessed it, that one was delayed by an 1.5 as I＊m writing - AND COUNTING!) The icing on the cake is that they tried to give us $15 meal vouchers for our trouble, but upon presenting them to a vendor, they had not been loaded. DO WE EVER MAKE IT TO OUR DESTINATION? That is a question we still have no clue what the answer will be. We＊re going on over 8 hours of total delays, the airports are closed tomorrow due to strikes. Also who knows where our bags are. I can only hope they uphold THEIR side of the agreement and get us to our destination.

So I feel that Lufthansa discriminated against me as a solo traveller and gave my seat to others so that they could conveniently sit together, even though they clearly booked and / or chose their seats later than me. There was absolutely no consideration to me or my preferred seat selection. On arrival at Funchal Airport I was also informed that there is no lounge. The whole idea of travelling in business class is to be able to escape from the main passenger contingent and get some peace and quiet and a nice drink and a snack. No such possibility at this airport. I have travelled quite a lot with this airline in recent years and have witnessed a clear deterioration in standards.",negative,-0.688745,0,70,10.475653,7.432484

Boarding in Bristol is by walking to the plane, and disembarking by bus in Frankfurt, both seemed well organised and with no delays. Upon arrival, the walk through Frankfurt Airport from the bus gates to the Z gates was well-signed and with no need to go through security again. The flight between Frankfurt and Singapore was delayed by an hour. Being a 747 on a busy route, the flight was full but boarding was quite fast with their automatic gates. The seats in economy are smallish but fine for anyone under 6ft. The flight attendants were again polite, professional and had ready smiles. The IFE system had a wide choice of films but was somewhat slow to use, and the Wifi wasn't working on this flight. There was a choice of supper (vegetarian pasta or chicken teriyaki) along with wine, beer or soft drinks. Unlike Singapore Airlines, the crew didn't walk around with drink trays in the middle of the night, so the next meal/drink was a breakfast (cheese and sundried tomato sandwich, yoghurt and the little chocolate).

I ran through the airport because they didn't offer transportation to the gate even though all the delays are their fault, and let me tell you that there were no severe weather conditions or any complications of that sort.

I managed to rebook but after that checked every day to make sure we still had the flights to go back. Stressful and unnecessary! The flight back was on time and the older lady (she was the only one in business class that was pleasant!). The guys were extremely rude and one of them was more interested looking and playing with his moustache than providing service. The short flight from Frankfurt was pleasant and the staff lovely. So to summarise this. The worst experience ever, rude and unpleasant staff (with exception to 3 ladies on 2 flights) unorganised, lacking communication, no clear guidance.

LH use the upper deck lounge for business passengers, I definitely wouldn't pay for it. Grumpy, unwelcoming, miserable looking staff. Male toilet out of order. 10.15am I was told that I couldn't have a croissant as breakfast was over. Once on board the aircraft your seat is an economy seat with the centre one blocked off. No different to BA. The cabin did look a bit tired and used, Cabin Crew were lovely and the catering was of decent quality if a bit miserable. On the return trip the crew were exceptionally nice especially the Purser. You could tell that this lady enjoyed her work. I was impressed with her friendliness and attentiveness. Drama in Glasgow though when my luggage wasn't on the belt. Menzies aviation didn't seem to care. They didn't even give me a lost luggage ref number and also did not put my contact details onto the computer. They have done everything possible to prevent you from phoning them. A call to LH the next morning got thigs sorted. Menzies received my luggage on the morning of the 3rd Jan and didn't deliver it until the afternoon of the 4th. Despite RUSH/SAME DAY DELIVERY being labelled all over the cases. I live 30 mins from the airport.

Needed to rebook parents' flights due to my father's medical emergency back in June... called a zillion times, phones constantly disconnecting, three times spoke to a different rep who rebooked for me, three times supposedly booking was confirmed, but then the booking code disappeared from the LH website... I'm beyond appalled!!! What a scam this airline has become!! I kept calling 1800 645 3880, the USA phone number. For weeks, even months, the voice message would say that the lines were busy and to call later. I finally got my call answered in November. I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. I tried the second time. The second rep assisted, I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. Five times in a row! This cannot be normal. At one point, I asked the rep whether they were having issues with phones, and she responded yes, but they are being worked on. But I called on other days, too, and it was the same. I got disconnected every time I got a rep on the phone. Is this a tactic by Lufthansa to keep customers away? Basically you can't get anything solved, since you get disconnected every time!! And I repeat, EVERY TIME!!! Over a span of two weeks, I called the US phone number about 10 times, and got disconnected every time, after I explained to the rep what I needed. So I called the German phone number +49 - 69 - 86 799 799, on December 5, 2022. The rep reviewed the files and offered to rebook my parents' tickets. We spend over an hour on the phone (and got a message from AT&T phone company that I just got charged $200 for the long distance call). The rep gives me a new booking code. She took my credit card number and said I would be charged $41.23 for tax, and $150 for rebooking, for either of my parents. I agreed to these terms. The rep gave me the new booking code. I checked on the website, and the code was on the LH booking site. Two days later I checked again, and the code was no longer there. I called +49 - 69 - 86 799 799 again. Asked a different rep why the code disappeared from the LH website. The rep checked, and said it was because those flights were no longer available (nobody let me know that!

This is on top of being told we will be provided a ※meal§ but being given only trail mix, some kind of chocolate cookie bar, water and juice. We were also loaded onto shuttle buses that had very few seats, we were packed in like sardines, and taken to the tarmac to board a new flight. We watched them load our luggage while we sat stationary on the tarmac with no explanation. Then they started unloading the luggage back off the plane and we began receiving texts that our flight was delayed again until 4pm them immediately received another text stating it was delayed until 6pm. My partner as significant rheumatological health problems and did not have access to a seat, which is a problem for her, and was in tears from standing stationary on a flat hard surface for so long. There was poor air circulation on the shuttle and the close proximity of everyone packed onto the shuttle quickly made it become suffocatingly hot.  We waited approximately 45 minutes on the shuttle in front of the plane before being told, with zero explanation, that we were being taken back to the gate we had just left.  We were then told that our gate was moved from z54 to B23, which is quiet the hike in the airport. This is on top of sleep deprivation and zero real food.

The only thing I can add is that I am shocked that the Department of Transport in the U.S. and the FAA continue to allow Lufthansa to operate with impunity. I have flown Lufthansa for decades, (because I primarily fly on United, and being the Star Alliance partner, inevitably I would be on Lufthansa in the European portion). This month was the first time I traveled outside of the U.S. since the pandemic. I had heard that Lufthansa has completely fallen off the cliff in terms of service, reliability and even general operational adequacy, but I thought, a short 2 hr flight RT between Frankfurt and Madrid, how bad can that get? Their seats booking system is broken, and while we had paid for premium seats over and over again (and promised previous overcharged payments would be refunded, I don't expect to see that refund), we essentially had no premium seat assignments up to the day of departure. Their ground crew was rude and hostile, (e.g. just did not answer my questions, rolled their eyes and smirked with agents next to them, etc.), and the flight crew basically was not present throughout the flight. No service whatsoever on the flight (no snacks, no drinks, I didn't know this is a discount budget airline?). Mobile boarding pass could not be issued at time of check in, I had to line up at airport, at which point, the agent harassed me by insisting on weighing my carryon (they did not insist on doing that for my husband who is White), and said my carryon was 1 kg over, so I had to check it. At least, my luggage did not get lost. I was horrified by the experience.

A Lufthansa representative eventually advised the delay due to a ＆technical＊ problem, and that ground staff would at Frankfurt would be on hand to help all passengers with late or missed connecting flights. While waiting for our plane to land in Geneva we were told the replacement plane was smaller than the original intended plane, as such, our hand carry luggage would have to be surrendered upon boarding, This created even more delays. 40 minutes into the flight, the pilot announced that due to bad weather, the flight would be now diverted to Nuremberg. At the Nuremberg tarmac, we were given little information. Hours later we were told we would be bussed to Frankfurt, however we were waiting for a bus to arrive, and also, there were no ground crew to help disembark the luggage. Later, we were told to collect our luggage and wait for the bus. No specific area was designated. Eventually an airport representative came out and advised the bus would be arriving in 10 minutes The bus ride would take approximately 2 and a half hours. During this entire 6-7 hour Geneva to Frankfurt ordeal, passengers were not fed nor given time to use the bathroom. During the bus ride I received emails from Lufthansa advising me they had, without consulting me, rebooked the remainder of my trip home. This rebooking meant an entirely different route, and it would also mean I would arrive back in New Zealand a whole day later than I had intended. At Frankfurt we disembarked at a bus stop. No Lufthansa representative was there to greet or advise us. The bus driver simply drive away with no instructions. A majority of the passengers stood around lost and confused. Using my phone Google maps, I began walking terminal 1 at Frankfurt airport. At the terminal, we discovered it largely deserted. Not surprisingly as it was well after midnight. Most check-in counters were closed. Eventually we found some staff who handed every passenger vouchers for 1 night stay at a hotel and two taxi vouchers and told us we had to sort out our problems in the morning. Weather problems aside, if there were no technical problem with Lufthansa's plane to begin with, we would have landed in Frankfurt on schedule and avoided the airport closure due to ＆bad weather＊ and I would have made my flight to Hong Kong. Even after the bad weather and plane diversion issue, the lack of support and help from Lufthansa made the bad experience worse.

Since the booking was made, there have been countless flight and schedule changes requiring us to repeatedly contact customer service to accept changes and/or find alternatives as proposed by the agents and re-book on alternate flights with different airlines, timings, dates, airports etc. Despite the extensive flexibility on our end in terms of these factors, every time we called and confirmed a booking with an agent, we were left to find that the booking had either not been made, changed again, or entirely cancelled. We have evidence documenting the numerous calls lasting over 50 hours in total, as well as all the emails/screenshots of bookings from the website documenting the booking changes, as well as the flight cancellations that were made without our knowledge and were not informed of until checking ourselves. At this time, despite multiple attempts to resolve this issue, the itineraries are missing components of the journey as originally booked ie. the last leg of the trip from DEL - AMD for record locators #1 & 2. The customer service agents have not been able to resolve this and have pretty much said there is nothing they can do in terms of ensuring we have confirmed flights for the entire trip as planned and have left us hanging, without answers, and in a panic as our travel date approaches.

Schedule changes feel very much the norm in today's travel however, I would have hoped the passenger log for my flight would have been correct. Shortly after take off the lead member of the cabin crew took his time to introduce himself to some of the passengers with some polite chat. At this point it became apparent, despite checking in 12 hrs earlier the passenger log had no idea who I was. Asked if I was someone I wasn't, an accusing ""have you changed seats"" was delivered followed by the non reassuring ""oh, no don't worry"" and a clear tone of 'your not at a high enough loyalty member to warrant my time' was delivered in a closing remark. It should be easy for the cabin crew to tell the truth, so when during the second meal service I was informed that the first option was no longer available I was surprised to see the opposite row still able to order and receive, with the polite question asking if option 1 was actually available my original meal choice was found. I can't help thinking Lufthansa have stripped all customer service out of their operation, several attempts to contact the team before the flight were ignored, the only engagement came when they cancelled a section of the journey and asked me to call them, nice touch that their automatic email pretends they have tried to contact me. A small connection flight cancellation was apparently enough to confuse the booking system and the many people in the call centre.  It took six hours of my time reviewing the Lufthansa schedule and and their ticketing availability to find a route that the 'system' would allow. To rub salt into the wound, at HND I was approached by an agent for Lufthansa and asked if I would like to change flights,  for one of the routes I had been denied and that had always shown availability.

While the seating arrangement in 2-2-2 is not the latest standard for business class, I found the seat comfortable enough for 11 hours.

She selected seats in a row that was about halfway between the mid and rear toilet areas. (Around row 40) When we arrived at the departure lounge at Munich there was some sort of loud-speaker bargaining situation going on. The Lufthansa staff clerk was stating that a woman in Business class had her seating booking messed up and as such she was going to be separated from her two kids. The clerk was asking for volunteers to give up their seat in order for the woman and her kids to be together. The suggestion was, that the flight wasn't happening until this seat problem was settled. After some time, a guy volunteered to a round of applause from the rest of the people being held up. When we got on board, I got to the row that was printed on my boarding pass that I had been given when we checked our bags earlier in the day. I hadn't checked if the seat matched my wife's online booking from the previous day. When I got to the row shown on my pass, there was a guy sitting on the aisle in what I thought was mine or my wife's seat. A short argument ensued until the guy pointed out the seat next to the window matched my boarding pass. Some people in seats in front of us turned and said they have messed up all the seats. The seats my wife and I endured for 12 hours were right in front of the toilets with little or no movement of our seats or chance to get out without climbing over the lucky winner of the aisle seat. The seats were in a row that was roughly 20 rows different to the one we'd booked. There was no acknowledgement or apology from staff. We noted that the crew were absent from the end of the aisle to welcome passengers to Singapore. Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Brisbane was the third and last leg of our journey, an approximately 8-hour flight. We had tried to once again book our seats online, but the airline was trying to charge $20 dollars for the privilege. So, we just indicated that we'd prefer aisle seats. We received our boarding pass and we'd been given aisle seats in different rows. My wife in the row that is normally reserved for parents with babies and the row immediately behind. When we arrived on board, of course there was a woman with a <1yo baby breast feeding in the adjoining seat.

I was then rebooked for another flight 6 hours later from Munich to Singapore with a 7 hour layover to Seoul. The reason I booked Lufthansa in the first place was to get the direct flight from Europe. But apparently there was not even one seat available on the direct route the day after. I could have stayed at an airport hotel and Lufthansa could have at least guaranteed me a somewhat comfortable sleep as compensation for their delay, but instead I get to spend the night on my way to Singapore and a day at the airport, already tired from the long extra wait, not even to mention missing my meetings in Seoul that I had planned. When I booked my original ticket I had paid extra for window seats, but as the window seats were already fully booked I got an aisle seat and when I asked if I could at least be upgraded for the inconvenience I was told that it would be on my own expense. As I will be almost 24 hours delayed I thought as it states on the Lufthansa website, that I would get the necessary care during the redirecting, but all I got was a 15 euro voucher (which had to be spent all at once) in one of the airport restaurants. Sadly most meals start at 20 euros so it should rather be called a modest meal contribution instead.

I thought it was supposed to be a reputable airline but the service provided to us after we missed our connection in Munich (at the fault of the airline) was extremely poor, and frankly embarrassing for a member of Star Alliance. First, the positives. They automatically booked us on the next flight once our connection had been missed, although this sadly did involve another connection in Frankfurt. Also our baggage did not get lost. So they do get 2/10 for these 2 positives. So, what went wrong? Inconveniently, there was not a single member of Lufthansa staff available at the airport in Munich. Thankfully we had downloaded the Lufthansa app, which seemed to be the only way of accessing the information of the new itinerary. Customers who did not have the app really struggled to find the information as there was no email or SMS communication. EU passenger rights say that the airline is obliged to provide hotel accommodation if the delay is overnight. However, we were told by the cabin crew during the descent that we had to book our own accommodation and then ""send them the bill"". We took the alternative option of staying in the airport, as there was only an 8 hour gap before the new flight to Frankfurt departed. Having to spend a night in Munich airport with our 2 year old was not the greatest experience. The food that Lufthansa provided was frankly shocking. Crisps, chocolate biscuit bars and sugary drinks do not constitute a meal, and this disappointment came after no complimentary food was served on the flight into Munich. All the restaurants, cafes and shops in the airport were closed, so we went without an evening meal that day. Lufthansa did provide blankets and pillows, and then we set about trying to find a place to sleep. The designated sleeping area clearly had not been cleaned. There were only 4 private pods which were all taken, so we ended up with a majorly uncomfortable night on the floor of the airport. Perhaps this is not necessarily the fault of Lufthansa, but if they are not going to book hotels for passengers then they should at least make sure the airport sleeping areas are clean. The next morning we boarded our new flight to Frankfurt at 6am. On arrival, I searched out the Lufthansa service desk to make a complaint, but again found an empty desk. Most disappointingly, we were not able to speak to a member of Lufthansa staff that could help during the entire journey. They did sent a breakfast voucher via email, however the voucher was not accepted by the cafe closest to our gate for Muscat, so that meant spending an extra 17 for breakfast for the 3 of us. No further dramas onward to Muscat, however this flight was with a partner airline. It has been over a month since the flight and still no correspondence from Lufthansa regarding the compensation that we are entitled to by law. The only communication we've had was an email telling us to confirm our new itinerary (sent 2 days AFTER we arrived) and an automated email in response to my complaint, which asked me to submit my flight details (which I had already done 3 times by this point). This experience is in stark contrast to a previous experience with KLM, travelling to Dubai via Amsterdam, where we were given the compensation in cash at the service desk, and there was a driver waiting outside to take us to a hotel for the night.

When we checked in to return home, one of our group members was stopped because her maiden name was on her passport and her married name was on her ticket. Our booking agency, the check in counter, and the Lufthansa customer service line would not assist us with a name correction. We had been first in line at check-in, and went back and forth with the representatives for Lufthansa until we had less than an hour til our flight would take off. We were told we had to buy a $3500 ticket. When we attempted to, the airline couldn't verify our information and rejected the purchase. A supervisor for Lufthansa overrode the restrictions and let our last group member through. We made it to our gate and when we went to board the plane, all our tickets were denied. The same supervisor was at the gate and told us our booking agent had canceled all our tickets without authorization. We called the booking agent who said our tickets were still all confirmed from their end. Then we called the Lufthansa customer support representative who we had talked with earlier. She told us someone at the Glasgow Airport had canceled our group and given away our tickets for both flights of our trip home. We were told we would have to buy six new tickets for a later flight. The gate closed but by some miracle, the pilot heard what had happened and let our group on the plane because we had confirmation numbers, boarding passes, and passports. We encountered the same probably at our layover in Frankfurt. At a small security checkpoint, all our boarding passes were flagged. At the gate, the representative told us our flights had been canceled and given away. She seemed unsurprised at the predicament as if Lufthansa had caused similar issues before and assured us she would do her best to get us on the flight home. We were all able to return home on standby. When we arrived in Atlanta, Lufthansa had lost all of our bags.

But I guess this might just be an older plane and the seats were tight, and there was no storage space or little cubbies. I＊m not even a tall person and I found the seats to be less than well padded. The food service was okay, but it was served off of trolleys like you were in coach. We haven＊t seen anything like this in another business class. And, they didn＊t give an amenity kits.

The first leg from Brussels to Frankfurt was Okay, I do not remember anything extraordinary about it, it was a short 40 minute flight in a regular plane with a regular very-short-haul experience. The second leg from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv was rather odd. We had a connection of 2.5 hours. When we landed in Frankfurt on time the screens showed us the flight was already boarding, which we found to be very weird. We sprinted to the gate, through connection security and passport control, and were devastated to discover that apparently, Israel has special travel regulations that make all flights landing to Israel go through a special process. Our gate was separated from all other gates, it had extra security and when we passed it we saw there is no plane even at the gate. So after security we were essentially locked in a gate that had only one super-over-priced store selling basic literature and food. We waited for 90 minutes until boarding started. When we sat in the plane the pilot announced that our plane ""has the wrong wheels"" and that it would take us 3 hours to replace all the wheels of the aircraft. All passengers were angry. After 40 minutes the captain announced that we will be brought back to the gate, and transferred to a different aircraft. After an hour buses were organized to the new airplane, same model, A321. Once we arrived there were a few dramas involving passengers that were mad that because the configuration was a bit different in the new plane, couldn't seat next to their loved ones. After an intervention of the German police we took off. The crew was excellent, especially A Stadelmann, who although being very tired as we did, did her best and gave an excellent service. At turbulence when I panicked she noticed and calmed me, we had a quick chat and all in all she was very welcoming, using words like ""dear"" to make me feel warm and welcome aboard the plane. The flight was regular, there was no entertainment, and complimentary soft drinks and disgusting sandwiches were given. We landed in a delay of almost three hours, the flight after the drama went perfectly fine. Lufthansa should check her planes twice before almost letting passengers fly in them!

There was a flight from Krakow to Frankfurt LH 1371 on the same day and time as my canceled flight from Katowice. I called Lufthansa USA again with a request to change the canceled flight from Katowice to the one from Krakow. A sleepy lady (probably from India because she spoke English poorly) stated that there is no such flight! And he can offer us a flight from Katowice To Berlin from Berlin to Munich and from Munich to Frankfurt. Of course, I interrupted the conversation because my patience was exhausted. On the Lufthansa website I have easily booked a flight from Krakow to Frankfurt LH1371 (July 22.2022). Of course I had to pay for this flight separately as no one at Lufhansa wanted to help us and rebook for this flight. Let me add here that the distance between Katowice and Krakow airports is less than 63 miles. And for the best now, Lufhansa is refusing to reimburse the full costs of the flight they have canceled. From the amount I paid $ 1135, they returned $ 86.90 so far! After 30 years of traveling with Lufthansa, it's time to say goodbye to them. ",negative,-0.703268,1,69,10.397269,6.690842

Price was outrageous, around 6,700 EURO / person, so 21,000 EUR altogether. Service for that price was completely inadequate. Seating: I'm tall but not super tall (6 ft 5''). Did not fit while sleeping into the narrow seat on the A330-300 Business Class, thus couldn't sleep at all. Used to fly a lot between NYC and FRA on the 747-800 (Business Class). That is a completely different size of seat, so it feels like they are trying to fit more seats into Business Class by shrinking the comfort.  Not enough Meals: We were 3 persons on that flight, each person getting their menu at the beginning of the flight. Turns out, they couldn't serve us what we wanted as they did not have enough meals on board. Compare that against the ticket price of 6,700 EURO per person. Also cabin service overall was mediocre ... this is a 9 h 30 min flight and there was close to zero service between meals. You had to actively get up and ask for anything you wanted. Can understand if you try to minimize disturbing sleep of the passengers, but no service is not the answer to that. Lastly, I have gold status (Senator) at LH and was asking at check in if they could connect that flight with my miles account which they said they did ('Are you sure?' Yes!). Turns out, this is not the case. Other than that, check in was nice and helpful. So overall after that experience in combination with that premium price, I would say LH are on the way to serve the market with premium marketing and price, but mediocre performance.

We arrived in FRA at 2330 where I was told that rebooking was not possible at that time and that I had to return to the airport the following day to get rebooked. I was given a taxi and hotel voucher. The hotel room stunk like cigarettes, cigarette burns were apparent, the bed was uncomfortable and the street noisy. I returned to the airport the following day at 0900 and waited in line for 5 hours to get to the rebooking counter where I was rebooked and checked-in on the similar route with flights departing the next day At that point my new expected time of arrival at final destination was 1505 on 02/08/22 每 delay 50 hours I was not given access to my luggage as these were already checked-in. I was again given a taxi and hotel voucher. The room was unfortunately not air-conditioned. The heat made the night rather short. Hygiene amenities were not available. On 31/07/22 at 1530 I presented myself with my boarding pass to the check-in counter at FRA. I was told that the boarding pass was not valid anymore and that my entire booking had been canceled. The staff at the check in counter were unable to help me and I was again told to line up at the rebooking counter. There, after another 4-5 hour wait, I was told that my entire booking had been canceled by the computer system because it had considered me missing my initial connecting flights as a ※no show§. In addition to canceling my booking the computer system had also surrendered the seats I had been rebooked on and these were now unavailable. I was then told that Lufthansa was unable to rebook me on a Lufthansa or star alliance flight for a period of at least 4-5 days. After further long delays I was offered a booking through Emirates and was told that that journey was my only option to get back to New Zealand. At this point, my new expected time of arrival at final destination was 1505 on 03/08/22 每 delay 74 hours I was again given a taxi and hotel voucher and spent the night at tyet another hotel where air-conditioning was available but unfortunately broken! This made for another uncomfortable night. Again hygiene amenities were not available. On the 01/08/22 at 1300 I presented myself to the check in counter at FRA only to be told that my ticket was on stand-by. I was eventually provided a boarding pass for the flights but was made to pay 246 euro to have the extra piece of luggage, which was included in the initial Lufthansa ticket, carried to my final destination. Generally I thought the airline representatives were not taking responsibility for the inconvenience that I experienced as a result of the disorganisation.

Difficult boarding caused by a lot of oversized cabin luggage. In Frankfurt the plane was not on a gate, we had to wait at least 10 minutes for the stairs and the busses. Drawing attention to the connection FA told me there are enough flights to Brussels. It was a Sunday however so we missed the connection - the plane was not on the gate and already announced with at least 30min delay - a polite request to organise an extra bus was denied very abruptly. Then they sent us to 3 different counters even one outside the secured area to rebook flights - situation at Frankfurt airport was a disaster. Separate lines for business are not existing anymore. I had to fly to Berlin and from there to Brussels and on that flight I was downgraded ""no availability"" for business. Later it seems there were 2 free seats - I was dropped in the rear area of the economy. I will not dwell on the various services on board however it seems FA must serve drinks as little as possible.

They were very rude to us and would not answer any questions we had.  The service desk staff told us that they will not give us any new boarding passes or more information on backup plans, etc until 0600 the next morning.

I have purchased the tickets Vilnius - Frankfurt-am-Main - Halifax with an 8 hours stop at Frankfurt Airport aiming to meet up with friends there and travel further to Canada. Though I checked-in 24 hours before departure it turned out that the flight LH889 was overbooked and app. 20 passengers incl. me were left behind. The airport personnel first asked us to proceed to the gate and wait until departure probably hoping (!) that some places will reveal themselves. But the miracle was not there and 20 unhappy passengers were asked to go to the airport workers to rebook their flights. After 1.5 hour waiting, fortunately, a Vilnius airport employee found a solution for me and managed to rebook the flight to Frankfurt via Amsterdam. So I had to stop at one more airport and spent in the air 2.5 + 1.5 hours (Vilnius - Amsterdam - Frankfurt / Main) instead of around 1 hour 10 min (Vilnius - Frankfurt/Main). I was acceptable as long as I was on time for my connecting flight to Halifax. But the next ""surprise"" was waiting for me in Halifax. My luggage did not arrive. I immediately filed a report at the airport and waited patiently a week as it was agreed with the lost&found service. Since then I regularly write complaints and emails to airports and Lufthansa and receive no feedback at all! Nobody answers the phone either. On top of all these circumstances I had to cancel my fully refundable return ticket due to personal reasons and was shocked by the refunded 80 USD instead of 611 USD.

Flew CRJ 900 from Basel to Frankfurt. Seated in front of exit row. No window and no recline seat. Good thing it was only a 1 hour flight. Frankfurt Airport was horrid. Bussed us from remote pad to A terminal. Then had to walk 3/4 mile through A to C terminal, but required to exit secure zone when left terminal A. There was two separate B terminal security lines which were at least 200 yards long. Figured lots of people would miss flights in that terminal The line for C terminal security took around 45 minutes. Although we had a connection time of 1.5 hours we barely made it through security to the C15 gate in time. When going through the boarding ticket scan I was told I had to pay for baggage which I had already paid on check in at Basel. Gate agent had no record of us paying for baggage which would have cost us another $100. I finally reasoned with gate agent that we had already checked bags in Basel and paid the fee in Basel so they finally waived the extra baggage fee. we boarded the plane exhausted and dehydrated from the walk. After walking as fast as we could From A to C, we did not have time to purchase any water because it would be discarded at security in C terminal. we were thinking we would get a bottle of water on the plane. Sat on ground after boarding for another 1/2 hour. No beverage service for at least 30 minutes after take off. No bottle of water, only a half full 6 oz plastic cup. And no ice. Servers skipped us twice during flight and only offered drink service 30 minutes after takeoff, during the meal two hours into flight and two additional times before the ""snack"" during the 11 hour flight. The snack before landing was two pieces of bread and a slice of white cheese. I had to ask the servers for some water twice after being skipped. Seats and legroom seemed smaller than those on Delta.

No doubt Lufthansa on a cost saving program? Found the air hostesses to be less than helpful- and in some instances even rude. Lufthansa premium Economy is sold at a 50% premium to the normal Economy. This is in our opinion an absolute rip off. We most certainly will NOT be flying Lufthansa again.

Did things improve when the departure date actually arrived? No, absolutely not. Lufthansa's online check-in didn't work a single time for me (multiple flights on a round trip) and the queues to try to talk to a Lufthansa employee were absurd at every single airport in my journey. Which I know because I had to talk to someone at every airport to try to get my ticket sorted. It was honestly a relief that their delays caused me to miss one of my flights because the layovers that they rescheduled me to were so tight that I'd been running frantically from place to place trying to make connections.

I was still 10 mins before take off by the time I reached the gate. But there is no plane there because gate has changed and passengers are supposed to get on a bus and get to a different gate. The agent at the gate told me to go to customer service. I waited in line for 1.5 hours to see one. And she told me there is nothing she can do and she keeps pointing finger to the Frankfurt airport, to United airline (the airline that I get the ticket for a flight operate by Lufthansa), and to me! She did nothing but pointing finger. My resolution was calling United and United put me on their own flight tomorrow. And I＊m still out of my own pocket for the hotel because United is not the cause for the delay. Then, I need to retrieve my checked bag and the Lufthansa agent told me to go to bag desk. When I reached Lufthansa bag desk they told me to go back up and talk to the check in counter. And the check in counter told me to go to the customer service center. The Lufthansa customer service center were full of people, then a Lufthansa agent came out and tried to talk people away. She closed the customer service center door and gave everyone a quick answer to the question. My question for her was where＊s my checked bag since I＊m now leaving tomorrow with another airline. She said Lufthansa has a system and the bag follows wherever I go. So I told her I am flying with another airline and how does that connect with the system of another airline. She said the system can do that but that＊s definitely a lie because I have an United agent on the line when everything happens and she told me she cannot see the bag on United system. So the Lufthansa agent just shut the door, lie to people to their faces and intimidate you to make you walk away. I went to the check in Lufthansa counter again and ask where＊s my luggage. This time the agent ask how come my luggage is not with me so I told her the whole story again and her comment was what happened to my us on TV everyday and it＊s just me being late so I make all these excuses up. In the end, she did told me I need to go to the United counter to have my bag transfer to the United system. I cannot understand how can everyone from Lufthansa so unhelpful and incompetent. And they worst part is they lie so that you walk away and said something untrue to make you feel bad and think they are not the problem. When there is such a long wait at the airport, they need to send out notifications to remind people to come earlier than 3.5 hours, which is already a lot and more than expected.

My daughter will spend the next 5 weeks in Italy and Austria without her suitcase because it is now being sent back to the US and not delivered to her hotel as requested. Her trying to purchase items to replace what was lost is a nightmare. The bag arrived in Rome 4 hours later. She sat at the airport waiting, only to be told it hadn't arrived which in the end was wrong and that it was on the flight. We did not find this out until four days later when her dad was flying out of Dallas and decided to see if anyone there could help. We thought by some luck she could get her suitcase only to receive an email that same day that it was being sent back to the US. The other frustration was this was a United flight operated by Lufthansa. Would United help in any way?

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,22-Jun,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Just 4 short years ago I flew on Lufthansa. I had no issues on my flight to Switzerland, the food was decent (as far as airplane food goes) and I was fairly comfortable (as far as the seating goes). I checked in no problem and well you got me to my point of destination with relative ease, my my my, how that has changed. This airline has made my life living hell in just 24 hours. They have screwed me not once, not twice, but about a million times over. Let's break it down. I am going to start with their website. The website is absolutely appalling in terms of navigation, to find any information on the website, you must navigate the entire website dictionary. Not to mention the pages upon pages of useless code (meaning the pages don't work). I will save you some time by giving you a few pages that don't work - The Baggage Calculator, The COVID 19 Related Documents Uploading Page, The login and Sign Up pages, and a ton of the characters and typography. All I can say is whoever is doing the code for the Lufthansa website needs to fired. Let's move on to baggage. For a long-haul flight, I feel like a personal item (a purse or backpack), a carry-on item (a small bag), and a checked bag are acceptable, especially considering the flight was $1,500 USD. But no. Not on Lufthansa, you have to shove everything you need for a 10-hour flight into a single carry-on bag that must weigh under 8kg. I work with technology for a living and what I need for my job alone weighs 8kg. Unfortunately, I will not be able to pack everything I need for the next 2 years into two bags, so I looked for how much it will cost to take 3 bags. There is not a dang thing on the website on how much it costs to check another bag. So I call Lufthansa. Nothing. So I call again. I could not get a hold of any operator or person even within the business hours, nor would they let me wait on the phone for someone. No contact, how convenient Lufthansa. Website flaw, maybe, customer service flaw, absolutely. It is now just 22 hours away from my flight. I currently live 2 hours away from the airport and can I check in for my flight online...nope, I have to check-in at the airport conveniently located nowhere near me. Oh and just so you are aware, the Lufthansa check-in page doesn't work either. All in all, I would not wish this kind of stress on my worst enemy and lord do I hope that you the customer are not flying on Lufthansa because you won't even be able to check-in for your flight. The worst part is, I haven't even gotten on the plane and I have read bad review after bad review on the actual service and food, so that might be another review coming soon.

Our plane was delayed leaving Boston for an unspecified reason. We were more than an hour late arriving in Frankfurt yet there was not a single Lufthansa employee meeting the flight to assist with connections. The gate where we arrived wasn't even within sight of any airport monitors to check for connecting flight information. My connecting flight had already departed by the time I found the gate. It is just mind-boggling to fly into an airline's home airport on a delayed flight and not have anyone to assist passengers with connections. I found a help desk that booked me on a later flight several hours later. I wrote to Lufthansa to make them aware of my bad experience on May 11. I provided copies of my ticket, boarding passes and reservation. Several days later I got a response from Lufthansa asking for most of the passenger and flight information I provided in the initial email, so I replied again giving them the exact same information that I'd already provided once.

On arrival in Bucharest one of our luggage failed to arrive in Bucharest. After a 27 hour flight, we had to waste another three hours at the airport to queue to register the lost baggage.  While in the lost luggage office, we received an email from Lufthansa saying that the luggage was delayed and will be dispatched to us at an address of our convenience. They gave us the tracking number and we filled the forwarding address for the luggage. But then after 3 days, the tracking stopped without notice and we lost the trace of our luggage. Last it was seen in Frankfurt we believe. Now, there is no one to contact and the lost luggage office in Bucharest states that there is not much they can do. They advised us to wait and call them everyday. But this hope for the best approach is not what we expected from a company like Lufthansa.

I have been a Senator Member of Lufthansa since many years and always enjoyed a fantastic service. However, since last year the service level has nose dived, be it the ground staff or the cabin attendants. Everybody seems to be in a foul mood always and absolutely not bothered to make the flying experience of its passengers pleasant. In my last flight from Frankfurt to St Louis the quality of the food was pathetic to say the least. It seems the quality of food that was served earlier to Economy class is now being served to Premium Economy. The Economy Class food is not up to the mark of Lufthansa level. Last year I had a very unpleasant experience at Valencia airport while travelling to Dubai and I couldn't fly. I had to buy an Emirates flight as an alternate as it was an urgent journey and I was more than surprised with the excellent service and the quality of the flight. I wrote about the unpleasant experience while checking in at Valencia to the Customer Service in Lufthansa and never heard back anything from them.

They were very accommodating and put us up in a hotel 20 min away from the hotel free of charge. However, we asked if we could get our luggage so we could have our change of clothes, our toiletries, etc, and they weren＊t able to do anything because ※they were already headed to our final destination§ which I would have understood.

If you want to upgrade your seats, the service desk is not able to assist or they claim everything is sold out but ask people to keep an eye for availabilities. We naturally did this, and last minute upgraded our seats, only to realize that they sell it nearly for free in the airport - this to advise that we tried to upgrade to business via phone but was told that it was sold out. In the airport they sold business cheaper than we had bought premium economy seats at the day before. Business was nearly empty on the flight and we were not allowed to upgrade in the airport, despite wanting to pay for same, as you can only upgrade once. When boarding we were shocked to see the seats, as the pictures of the class on their web is absolutely not picturing what you actually get. On the return flight, we again wanted to upgrade, as one of the ticket holders got injured and upgraded to business by the insurance company. We managed to upgrade the rest of us to prem eco only to find out, than in 3 weeks they had removed the ""all incl"" in the prem eco, hence limited avails of the drinks (both soft and alch). This wasn't even mentioned while being upgraded. Entertainment on board is very limited or not working. Very few movies, games platform not working at any of the flights and the wifi was not working on any of the flights. The food back from Mexico was not edible - and we are really not having high thoughts for food on board a flight - but when you pay a fortune to get food on board, then you should at least be served food which is being well cooked in order to eat it. Pancakes served for breakfast was not even fried enough to be able to eat it.

The first meal consisted of a salad of carrot, squash and aubergine, a roll, a cake with raisins, and a dry pasta with some tomato sauce. Initially, I thought that as the plane was full and I was at the back of the plane that this was the left over option. It transpires that there is only one option and it is vegetarian which doesn't bother me but might others. The pasta was pretty horrible and really felt like something a student might make. Just past and a bit of tomato sauce. the salad was small and bland. The roll and cake were fine. The second meal (breakfast) was a yoghurt a cereal bar and a dry sandwich (also vegetarian). Beer and wine are complimentary but spirits are not and come in at about 7 euros. No snacks or nuts with the drink service though you can buy them. The seat was fine, the entertainment system was difficult to use and had an average selection. The second flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo Haneda which was around 15 hours due to closed Russian airspace was in airbus. The plane was new and clean and the entertainment system was easier to operate. However the food and drink situation was the same. In fact the same nasty pasta was served this time accompanied by a couple of chopped up lettuce leaves. breakfast was the same too. I really felt that for 15 hours on a plane there wasn't much food. I understand that times are tough for the airline industry and that probably Lufthansa are cutting costs with the food and drink service but times are tough for the passenger too and being fed not very much and of poor quality on two different transcontinental flights is a poor showing especially on what is supposed to be a premium airlines.",negative,-0.614829,1,69,10.397269,6.690842

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Alicante,22-May,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Dealing with their customer service has been a nightmare...to say the least! We initially tried to book through Air Canada with this flight, but were informed that as we are travelling with a pet we need to call Lufthansa directly. Everything seemed fine and I gave my debit card details to the operator and was told I'd receive my booking confirmation within 72hrs. After 1 week I didn't receive anything, so I called again and this operation took my card information as if he was booking me another ticket, again I was assured I will receive the booking confirmation within 72hrs. Another week passes and I've received nothing (we can all see the pattern here!), so I call again. This operator told me that the payment couldn't go through as it was a Visa Debit card, so my partner gave her credit card and the payment went through in the time frame or so we thought! We still haven't received a confirmation for our pet in cabin. We call again (several times) to get a confirmation that our pet would be joining us on the flight, we were given 4 different responses, but always promised the confirmation will arrive by tomorrow or 48hrs or 72hrs (depending on who we spoke to). One month passes by and we give up and decide to leave it up to chance arriving with our pet at the airport with the hopes we can take him. But it doesn't end there, about 1.5 months after booking our flights I receive another booking confirmation email for the same flight and the price was taken from my account. So I call and cancel that flight and received a refund of the full amount. I know what your thinking ""It must end here!"", think again. On the day I received my refund I had two more transactions taken from my account, totaling the amount that I was just refunded! In our preparation to move to another continent, I had missed these transactions coming from my account. So the night before my flight, as I was checking in, I noticed and I called explaining my story to the operator, she was no help at all as we were trying to figure out this issue. The call then dropped. Calling back again I got another operator and at this point I wanted to speak to someone with more knowledge, so I asked for the manager. He told me this isn't possible and that he can help me, I expressed that I have called about a dozen times to simply get a flight for 2 people and a pet, I've been booked on the same flight twice and charged three times. At this point I just wanted to speak to someone with a bit more experience. I was put on hold and told it wasn't possible for him to do that, but he did direct me to their website to request a refund, (I mean come on, that's the best you can do, submit a refund for a flight that I've already cancelled?). I thank him for and submit the form, but there was nowhere to upload the documents. So I called again, explained the situation to another person and I was giving an email to send my bank statements to and now I wait! But all in all, this experience with Lufthansa left such a bad taste in my mouth that the whole experience was horrible. There will not be a next time.

I called customer service, after a long wait, they answered. The Philippine call center said it wasn't an upgrade for me, it was just for my wife. I checked many times and I saw that they took money out from my bank. I ask him we don't want to fly separate so to return my wife's ticket to its original purchasing and refund the money, they said it was not possible. 50 minutes spent over the phone for nothing. I called again, another agent was completely ignorant, same story but this time she said my wife's ticket was not upgraded either. I said she was wrong, even though I stated that I had a computer printout and I got the Seat number. 1 hour and 10 minutes waste of time. I called for the third time, I didn't give up.

I hung up the phone, I didn't spend time for my ticket so I can handle mine at the airport. 45 minutes. I didn't feel comfortable, so I thought I'd check one last time before going to bed. Unfortunately, the seat number has changed again and it has become economy class. I called again, 48 minute wait. Inconclusive.

I had bought round trip tickets from Marseille to Quebec for a price of about 700 in November 2019. The outward journey in January 2020 and the return in April 2020 (Quebec-Montreal-Zurich-Marseille). During the Covid crisis, all flights, including all companies, were cancelled. For Lufthansa also, the company modified the flights, telling me that some of the internal flights were to be modified, around March. It took hours with customer services to find and agree on another internal flight, only for the trip to be cancelled two days later. This has happened several times. The company is now cancelling all these flights in April, which is understandable in view of the global crisis. The postponement of flights is done on the month of May, where the customer service simply tell me that my flight has been moved as is to the following month. A few weeks before departure, internal flights were also cancelled, forcing me to spend hours on the phone to get a new flight and keep my trip. Once done, the flight was cancelled again, telling me that the company had no flights in April and postponed my trip to May. It's also the same story when my May flight date arrives, hours on the phone to change an internal flight after it was cancelled only to be told that my flight has to be rescheduled for June. Except that I consulted the company's website to check if a new reservation was possible. Indeed, the company was operating flights but the tickets were close to 5000$. The company's strategy was simple, postpone my flight booked in November 2019 for 700 to avoid losing a seat which was then sold at five times. I had to buy another ticket (from another company) to be able to return. Obviously the actions to be reimbursed for my return have never given any answers.",negative,-0.820927,1,68,9.729789,-7.69257

But one of its biggest disappointments on the service front is its lack of consistency. On some short-haul flights, the service has been excellent, being addressed by name and frequently checked on if I needed anything, and good food, and on others the service was almost nonexistent. On boarding my flight at Heathrow, and from Munich to London, there was no priority boarding, but the first ten rows ushered in first. There was no welcome, and Anti-bacterial wipes were handed out, but not on the return flights. On the London to Munich sector, breakfast on board was quite substantial, with ham and cheese, cereal, but with cold bread and croissant. On the flights to Rhodes and return to London, the food was unappetizing. One expects a hot meal for lunch and not a concoction of something cold. On the flight from Rhodes to Munich, there were only two passengers in the business cabin. However, the lunch was swiftly served, cleared within about 15 minutes, and the crew not seen until landing. Overall, although there was no interaction with passengers, the cabin crew was efficient and polite. On the drinks front, seconds were not offered, and I had to ask for them. As for seating, it is as most European airlines are, with no extra legroom, except for the middle seat left empty. I was disappointed with the downgrading of Lufthansa's overall in-flight service, and only give my thumbs up for good value when it comes to the ticket price.",negative,-0.663817,1,69,10.397269,6.690842

Boarding was slow and messy requiring passengers to queue to have their documents checked, then queue again to check our tickets, then queue again in the jet bridge. What is the point of assigning boarding groups when all but priority passengers are called to board at the same time? Seats in economy were akin to a budget airline with minimal legroom, no headrest or entertainment. Cabin was not clean, and crew handed out alcohol wipes. On both legs I took with Lufthansa there was no food or drink available, complimentary or paid. This was a 2 hour service right about lunchtime.

The meal choice was poor (only veggie pasta on both legs) and the service of the crew left much to be desired. It seems like the lack of customer service just gets blamed on Covid. Worst of all was the terrible spacing/leg room in economy class. It is big enough for a 10 year old kid but not for a normal size adult. It really felt like the airline wanted to cramp in more passengers to make up for the losses incurred during the pandemic without any regard to the comfort of passengers.

The seats were large and with good leg room but somehow found that the lower back support was not very good. However the on-ground experience was not as good as the premium economy experience with other airlines especially on the Delhi to Frankfurt leg of the flight. Lufthansa does not have a separate check-in counter for Premium Economy and did not offer priority boarding as well on the Delhi Frankfurt leg but did so on the Frankfurt - Chicago leg which was a bit strange.

It started with check in, which in Berlin is done by a contract company that is not able to provide its agents with accurate information on entry requirements. I had a long argument with the agent who nearly refused to issue my boarding passes although I had all the necessary documents with me (and no problem at all at immigration in Dubai later). Flight from Berlin to Munich on time, but otherwise nothing to praise about it. Lufthansa has introduced a buy on board service on domestic and European flights, but they didn't offer anything on this flight, so even if I had wanted, I couldn't get a coffee or snack. Munich airport is very easy to transfer, but repeated document checks at the gate resulted in a delayed departure. First time flying in Lufthansa's premium economy, and while I liked the seat comfort and additional space, it's disappointing that the service has been reduced to exactly the same as in regular economy, apart from a tiny glass of juice after boarding. They also cut the nuts or crackers with the first drink round, and they now serve coffee or tea together with the meal. That doesn't make any sense as your coffee will be cold once you have finished the meal. On the other hands, portions are shrinking year by year, so there is quite a chance that the coffee is still warm. Lufthansa definitely has to improve its service in economy, otherwise I will avoid them in the future.",negative,-0.548102,1,69,10.397269,6.690842

I had to have a friend in the US call, and even then they wouldn't rebook. The wanted to rebook a flight without refunding or giving me a voucher at all, and charge me over 1000$.

The lounge at M邦nchen airport was good, not too full with a decent selection of food and drinks. The ground staff was nice and the air hostesses; chatty and helpful. Seating on European routes is not that good, but with flight times under 1,5 hours that's not really a problem.

I explained this was not an alternative and was told there was nothing they can do. I was told to cancel, which would have cost us over ?2000 extra due to now booking last minute. I was hung up on 4 times by various agents (including one who just started taking other customer calls with me on the phone line). Eventually we managed to rebook with an increased travel time of 12 hours and after having spent 4 hours on the phone at 40p per minute over 3 days. The customer service is appalling.

Long wait times to talk to someone with a very hard to understand and thick accent only to be told that the flight I was requesting to change to, which was a cheaper flight, would actually cost $500 more despite initially paying for tickets that allowed you to change your flight without crazy fees. When pressed as to why the flight would be more expensive when anyone can look it up and see the cost vs. what I paid initially, there was obviously no response.

As for the in-flight service - it has changed for the worse so dramatically that from now on I will try to avoid flying Lufthansa. I used to fly transatlantic several times a year and Lufthansa was always a good option - not anymore. On a 12-hour flight from Frankfurt to Mexico City (10,5 hours backwards) they don＊t even offer meal options anymore! They just shove you a vegetarian pasta which is edible but unsatisfying. The ※breakfast§ is also vegetarian, both times it was a tortilla with cheese filling, it was cold and stale and I couldn＊t eat it though I was hungry. On the 3-hour flight from Frankfurt to Moscow they don＊t even serve free drinks - they give you a 300ml bottle of water a tiny chocolate bar at the end (you can grub several if you are really starving). Coffee and probably some snacks you can buy from them - that＊s how it works now. In general, food service is a disgrace and the flight attendants are polite but very abrupt. With their masks on, they are like robots - gone is all the niceness and kindness and good humour. All they care about is that your mask is covering your nose properly at all times. It＊s more like a sanitary convoy, not a service, and that was the impression throughout all 4 flights with them that I＊ve had recently.

We were so much tired, with a so little baby, so many and hard flights. At that (third) city (i don't remember which exactly, it was just for transition), we were already exhausted. We forgot my small bag at the airplane with my phone, documents, bank cards, money ut already couldn't return for it. I was in panic, cause in 1.5h we had another flight, to Kyiv. I, with a little baby on my hands, saw an airport crew guy - Mr Lenz, told him about my trouble. Truth be said I didn't think he can help, i thought he sends me to the special service for finding things  as most are doing.. But he said: don't worry, take care of your kids, I will get it for you. I was very happy. The airplane already wasn't at the place, Cristian did real magic and found that my bag before our next flight. I appreciate it so much! I even don't know what we would do, especially with 2 month old baby, who was already very tired. I'm so grateful this Person for His heart and willing to help.

The gate staff announced to encourage passengers to check their bags free of charge, but they didn＊t go out of their way to pick some obviously large and oversized bags. Once onboard, the overhead bin filled up quickly. Cabin crew were standoff-ish, saying that it was not their job to facilitate the space arrangement.  The flight was further delayed because passengers continued to run up and down the aisle to find space. Once arrived in Frankfurt, there was nobody at the gate to facilitate connecting passengers, so everyone ran for themselves. My second flight FRA-LHR was also further delayed for unknown reasons. Upon boarding, I was told to go to another gate staff to have my documents checked for COVID & locator form etc. The other staff  refused to do it because it wasn＊t her duty, whilst the one holding that duty was nowhere to be found.

I had multiple serious issues on the ground and in the flight, when Lufthansa staff demonstrated a full ignorance or arrogance to the passengers. The numerous complains to the support line result in formal response without any real measures. The COVID pandemics worsened this disaster service even to more catastrophic. I could provide my personal tens of examples how the Lufthansa employees treat the customers in bad manner, starting from business lounges and further at boarding and in airplane, however, this review is not aimed to make a long story but just to express the general status of the services by Lufthansa. Last but not least, recent changes in price policies and in-flight services just confirm the general trend of company degradation. For example, on some international flights longer than 2 hours (flight FRA-LED), which I recently used, there is no more complimentary food/drinks service. The ticket price, however, increased!

In-Flight Service : Very friendly and accommodating as Lufthansa has been in the past. Seat-Comfort - Due to the half empty flight, I was happily able to stretch out. However, even in a full flight, the seat would have been above average by economy standards. I can recommend the mini-economy cabin in front of economy plus on this particular plane. Food/Beverages - Good selection of beverages. Meals were fine (Ravioli for dinner and a sandwich box for breakfast), but nothing special by economy standards. No choice food alternative choice was provided. Entertainment - A bit of a more dated touch system, that was a bit sticky to navigate, but overall a good selection. WIFI - Offered, but not used by myself. Overall one of the better long-haul USA-Europe flights I've been on.",positive,0.674578,1,68,9.729789,-7.69257

They gave me an option for an intermediate leg that starts about 6 hours later from Frankfurt and options to cancel it and ask for a refund. I cancelled an intermediate leg as it is of no use as I cannot magically transport myself to Frankfurt and have my luggage automatically loaded in the aircraft for an onward journey. When I clicked refund my ticket, it errors out on their site and asks you to contact their customer service. I have been on hold for more than 2 hours on three separate occasions and yet unable to get in touch with their customer service. An email sent to their customer service to process my refund came back with a canned response from a DONOTREPLY email address. I have started the process of disputing the charge through my credit card company because according to their flight cancellation email I am entitled to a refund, just there is not way to request a refund online or via phone.

Both planes were clean. Both crews were courteous. Then the bad news time comes. Online check in was disabled. I arrived to check in desk at CDG2B 3 hours before departure (guessed that all who normally use online check in should be already there). My guess was just partly correct. Not just all Lufthansa, but also Swiss, Austrian and some other airlines sadly shared 3 or 4 staffed desks to check in all the flights to Munich, Frankfurt, Zurich, Vienna and God knows where else. The queue was endless and moving in the slowest possible pace. Things looked quite scary, so I opted to go directly to business class check in with my Turkish frequent flyer card (unsure whether eligible for that). After some 25 min of wait (at business class line folks) I was checked in and given tags for my carry-on.  Boarding was a mess. Calling passengers by groups (to lessen physical contact I guess) gate agents then asked everyone to form a standing queue near the gate door within a small space providing close physical contact. Then the gate door opened, so people were able to board, and without airline staff guidance things got back to normal. Onboard it was ok. The seat back recline has been eliminated since new A320NEO came to fleet, so seat comfort is now not on par with low cost carriers. A bottle of water and wet napkins were handed out. We took off and landed on time. Disembarkation in Munich also went by groups. It slowed things down, but not badly. Then boarding flight to Kyiv was another stupid quest. Without any announcement all the passengers were re-directed to another gate. There instead of boarding we had to get our boarding passes stamped. But with stamped boarding passes instead of boarding the plane we were diverted to the initial gate where they were trying to enforce boarding by groups ignoring the fact that stamping passports was not done by groups, so they were finally able to form quite a big disorganized crowd. Boarding took forever and some more covid infection was spread in this interesting way. Onboard it was uneventful. Overall disorganized, incompetent on the ground, uncomfortable in the air, overpriced and unworthy. I tried their inflight wireless.

It is been extremely frustrating for me to get my money and I am starting to think Lufthansa will not refund this money.

? Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to Vancouver,21-Aug,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  My daughter was denied boarding.  The adventure began already in the night before the flight when I tried to check-in my daughter electronically. This was not successful, because electronic check-in of LH asks whether or not a visa is available. In an exchange program, there is no visa, however, but an ""application approval"" and the visa is issued at the local airport upon arrival. Such a possibility is, unfortunately, not available within the electronic check-in at LH and electronic check-in could, therefore, not be performed. We arrived at the airport 4 hours before departure. As soon as our flight was indicated, we went to the indicated counters. However, only an electronic check-in was possible there. This check-in did not provide for the possibility to check-in children belonging to the exchange program either. Therefore, we went to the counters where check-in took place physically. After a long line, we were ready to have our documents checked. Although the documents were alright, the women at the counter still had to consult her manager because she was not sure if the documents were in order. When she was back, she confirmed that the docs were alright, but said that it was too late now and the gate had already closed and would not be opened for boarding for my daughter. Despite the fact that there was still over an hour before departure and that all other airlines I have experience with close their gates just before departure, LH refused to accept my daughter. Lufthansa fails to realize that it has a contract with the passengers and that not only passengers have obligations, but also LH has and it is expected to make an effort to find a solution, in particular in a situation which does not really presents a problem. Not to mention any kind of services which is fully missing on the side of LH. All in all, I consider this procedure unacceptable. Two days before departure, I wanted to clarify one more point with LH and called LH's information desk at 23:00. According to the information on LH?s website, the support line is open until midnight. The announcement on the phone was that all the lines were overloaded and the waiting time was 20 minutes. Since the clarification was important to me, I decided to wait. After waiting until 23.50, I hung up.

Check-in at CDG on an August Sunday afternoon was just one long queue for all Lufthansa and Swissair flights (despite buying my ticket online, check-in via the app was disabled). Even arriving two hours in advance, you would have very little time to spare to reach the aircraft given how slow things were going (luckily I was spotted by an airline rep as having no luggage to check in and was moved to the free business counter). The A320 to Frankfurt was new and spotless. The crew went around handing out a single alcohol towelette to each passenger in a great display of hygiene/safety precautions (other airlines give you masks, gel, wipes, etc). Each passenger was given an individual bottle of mineral water  and Swiss-style chocolates. That was it, for an early evening flight. On the FRA-HKG leg, there was no choice of dish for dinner or the usual apology of ""sorry, we have run out of"" -  some penne in tomato sauce. Breakfast was very skimpish and un-German (picture).

I requested a refund back in may and was told I will receive money back in 7-10 days. I called back 3 weeks after and they was no idea what refund I was talking about, they stated that there was no ticket for a refund on my account.

I said I would be happy to downgrade to a regular seat, they replied that you can downgrade at the airport, not on the phone, and then tried to get me to pay the 276.

Breakfast prior to landing was a sandwich. Flight attendants very efficient. The 747-8 provided a very smooth flight albeit with some minor turbulence over the Atlantic. This aircraft had the old familiar livery of LH which I actually prefer to their new livery. Landing was smooth, deplaning very interesting. Passengers were required to remain seated until their rows were called to deplane which actually made existing the aircraft very organized and orderly unlike the US carriers where it's every one for themselves.

? Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Brussels to Newark via Frankfurt,21-Jul,1,1,1,2,,1,1,no,1,"  I originally booked a direct return flight from Brussels to JFK for July 25th. My flight was supposed to be at 10.35AM. The day before the flight on July 24th, I went online to do my check in and just want to make sure everything is okay then I noticed Lufthansa had cancelled my flight without booking me another flight back to the US, meanwhile, I paid for round trip. So I spent last day of my vacation 4 hours on the phone trying to solve this issue. First, it＊s so hard to find a valid number to call Lufthansa for customer service. When we finally found a number to call, then it says they only work Monday to Friday. Long story short, I finally was able to rebook my flight for July 25th at 9.10AM. Boarding is so slow and inefficient. We were supposed to leave at 9.10AM but we did not leave until 9.40AM due to slow boarding. I originally paid/ booked premium economy seat, while they rebook me they downgrade my seat to regular economy. Then I have a connection flight from frankfurter to JFK at 11.00AM. While in the air I asked a crew member that I have connection flight if I can still make it and she said yes, if I ran. I ran through the immigration and I asked the guy who worked at the immigration again if he thinks I can make it then he told me he doesn＊t think so because of the gate is very far, the farthest gate it＊ll take me about 10+ mins if I run (Z68). When I finally ran to the gate, airline employees told me the boarding has closed. I missed my flight while my other fellow American who ran with me said while they were told this connection flight will wait for us. Then we were told there is no more flight out to NY JFK anymore for the day. We can either wait until tomorrow or go to Newark NJ. (But my car is parked at JFK long term parking). Then we have to go to another gate (Z12) to the counter in order to rebook our flight. Anyway, so I took that flight at 1:20PM (again they put me in regular economy while I paid for premium economy). Because of the whole chaos that Lufthansa put me through now I end up in Newark. So I have to figure out an Uber home or arrange pick up by friends while I have my own car parked at JFK where I booked my final destination to.

When I called their customer support the first proposal was a flight on November 30 (11 days later) leaving 6:55 in the morning and arriving 20:50 in the evening. There were flights available leaving 6:55 arriving 10:50 several times a week but we could not be booked on those because we did not have the right booking class.

The next time I called the proposal was even better: we would leave on the 29th and arrive on the 30th (a stay in a hotel was not included). I could contact customer relations if I did not like this, which I did. The only answer I got from them was that their customer services were able to handle this problem.

When I tried to get this changed I was told that I would have to pay because I confirmed their alternative. When they were calculating the cost they ended the call so I gave up and booked a flight with another airline and got home without problems.

To my surprise, 20 minutes before the departure, the Lufthansa person stopped me and did not allow me to get to the plane. I was told that I needed to have the PLF form from the Greek authorities. At the check-in in LAX nobody told me anything neither before when a few days earlier I had called Luftansa. Instead, they had assured me beeing a US and Greek citizen I did not need anything else. This time, 20 minutes before the departure of my flight to Athens, I was not allowed to enter the plane and I had to stay in Munich until I fill the PLF form. Although they had given me boarding card in LAX, they forced me to stay in Munich airport without any assistance  and they refused to put me in a new flight the next day with the excuse that my ticket was a United Airline ticket and not Lufthansa. This is the worst experience I have come across. The Lufthansa people in Munich did everything not to give me any assistance and to ignore me. They did not want to help me finding a hotel around the airport nor another flight next day, they did not even want to give me my suitcase that was already on the plane to Athens.

The outbound flight from Prague was great. They only gave out a bottle of water during the flight, but this is perfectly acceptable for a 50-minute flight.  Frankfurt airport is operating out of just the one terminal: Terminal 1. This means that the terminal was cram-packed full of people. There was only one restaurant open and it was expensive and the quality of the food was pretty poor.  The flight to Bilbao was approx. 2 hours, and during this flight they only gave out one bottle of water per person - all in the claim that it is because of COVID-19. The following morning, I received an email from Lufthansa - apologising that there have been changes made to my booking and asking me to either accept the new conditions, or choose not to and keep the flight open. The problem was that there was no alternative flight option shown. Lufthansa cancelled my return flight and didn't give me the option of rescheduling my return flight on 24th July. I went online and entered my booking details into their site and only my outbound flight was showing up. My ticket had been changed to a one-way ticket. I tried calling their customer service number but after multiple attempts - they just don't pick up - I gave up.

The only difference this time is, I have to deal with their customer service, and this is where it goes down hill. In February, I booked a ticket for my girlfriend to come visit me and unfortunately, the pandemic hits. The airports get closed and the ticket flight gets cancelled. As I read (or mis-read online) there was supposed to be a button in the online environment to click to issue a re-fund and so I did. Time goes by and of course they violate their own policy of returning the refund. The real problem for me starts in their communication. I've been trying to get hold of their customer service for the past 5 months by e-mail or by phone. Their phone lines are either flat out busy or cut out after 2 hours of being on hold. I've gotten hold of their employee's once in twenty1 hour calls.  I've gotten some written feedback but basically, none of it was anything more than that they acknowledged the situation but can't provide any help. Feedback on my ticket telling me they cant respect their deadlines.Me forwarding the claim to my credit card company. Lufthansa re-reviews the ticket but tells they can't help me without any argumentation. Creditcard company tells me I need a statement that my flight got cancelled (which i didn't got), so I re-approach via a ticket. I get hold of Lufthansa once by phone and they inform me I cancelled the ticket myself  because their system processed my action as a cancellation and they mention to me they can't see the flight was actually cancelled. Spoiler alert, the airport was closed, it was. I'm advised to re-make a flight disruption ticket to explain this. Here is specifically ask for a confirmation of the flight cancellation. Not a refund but instead of sending me that, they issue me to the refund department. Here I realised they are playing a game with me, because the moment they send me the cancellation confirmation, I can get the money refunded via my credit card company.

The boarding process on the other hand very well organised thanks to using the group boarding procedure. The flight was ok, on time and without any issues. The refreshments (salami sandwich, apple juice and water) were good quality and fresh and the cabin crew were also nice. The pilots didn't give any information on the flight, something I always appreciate in other airlines, such as BA.

At the airport the frustrated Lufthansa staff confirmed the same. So we stuck in Toronto, lost our tickets and may be the chance to get back home in this crazy times. I know that these days/weeks are extremely difficult for all of us but the way how Lufthansa left our family with confirmed tickets on an other continent showing no interest of finding any solution for us - this is very disappointing.

Would also recommend Lufthansa as an airline; professional staff, apologetic for delays and drinks served although the two flights were short.

Went downstairs to business to check and the temperature was much better. Screen size for entertainment is good but for a screen that is that far away, the writing for the menu etc should be bigger. Had to put on my reading glasses to read the on screen options. Left FRA an hour late due to long taxing and de-icing, but pilot made up time to arrive into HGK 40mins late. The person who served me was nice and personable, the rest were just going through the motions as quickly as possible. Went to the kitchen a few times to get water. Had to ask for ice and was served out of almost flat mineral water bottles. Soft drinks were served out of bottles into glasses, small amounts, had to ask for more. Food was reasonably tasty but nothing special and portions were small. More of a Degustation size/type menu than proper meals. Very disappointing. My wife and daughter, who were sitting further up front could not get another croissant nor the scrambled egg choice for breakfast because they were none left and the server was grumpy to them.

Short hops between LHR-FRA were on new A320-neos in both directions and were perfectly comfortable with a small snack provided. Long haul A340-300s used to Chennai say they are 'operated by Lufthansa Cityline' but the passenger experience is identical to normal Lufthansa. Seats are comfy enough with adjustable headrests, sufficient pitch for 6'2 male and decent recline for night flying; managed to sleep almost 5 hours! Although the planes may be getting on now, the interior feels very freshly refurbished and still love Airbus A340/A330 planes in economy with just 2-4-2 layout - much better than Boeing's now standard 3-4-3. Entertainment was good quality screen with decent enough selection with probably about 70-odd movies though a poor selection of mostly German TV programmes. The meal just before Christmas was delicious goose, sauerkraut and dumplings, and with metal cutlery too, then a small sandwich-sized snack before landing. Toilets were kept clean (though maybe best to avoid being too close to them as they got a bit whiffy at times and with all 5 loos together in the middle of the plane, lots of footfall during flight), cabin crew were efficient and were perfectly friendly with me - as a German speaker they seemed to reserve a special extra level of smile when someone spoke German, but I saw several being very direct with other non-native English speakers regarding putting bags in lockers and one seat assignment at the start of the flight. An Indian chap in his 40s found someone sitting in his seat and sought help from an FA to talk to the person, to which she replied condescendingly, ""I think you're old enough to ask that yourself, aren't you?"" That aside, they were good, the pilot kept us informed well of minor delays and most flights arrived on time.

Finally contract ground service arrived and two women loaded me into wheelchair and sprinted me through concourse, Passport Control, through tunnel, up elevator and then onto electric cart for high speed ride to Gate Z 69 which was at least a mile downrange, still. Made it just in time. If I had not had excellent help from ground personnel, would have definitely missed the one daily flight to Orlando.

Once the bar service was opened, I opted for a scotch on ice, but with a half litre bottle opened, I got a very small drink served! That was followed by a tasty lunch, wine, and I settled down to watch a movie on the IFE. The choice here is a very limited (compared to the likes of Emirates). On my return flight, which was late night, the service started with drinks and a delicious beef sandwich. 90 minutes before arrival a bland breakfast was served consisting of omelet and cold items. The seating on Premium Economy is very comfortable (2x3x2). The usual water bottle and small amenity kit was also provided. But as I was at a window seat, stepping out to use the toilet was difficult, especially as the passenger in the front seat had his seat reclining.

However, on landing we had to be moved to a far away parking slot and it incurred a long bus ride, and further rail ride to the actual allocated terminal area.

But like the previous promise of another flight, the shuttle was non existent so we ended up paying for taxis out of pocket. Next day when we arrived early to follow the given instructions about the compensation once again, no one knew anything and everything they told us was wrong. The only thing we could do was file a claim online. Of course this is a very convenient way of not dealing with customers.

The Senator Lounge in Berlin is in free fall. There was a lot of talk about the new Senator Lounge. In the end, the new one is worse than the old one. The choice of food and drinks is very limited. For breakfast, there used to be at least three choices of cold cuts and cheese; now, it is one each. The croissants are gone, the toast has gone, there is only one kind of sliced bread. There is no free champagne anymore, the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks selection has suffered considerably. Shame on Lufthansa for giving such a bad impression in their lounges in the German capital. The departure from Berlin was 30 minutes delayed because of the late arrival of the incoming aeroplane. However, the announcement was only made when it was already time for the pre-boarding announcement. As I was in a good position overlooking the apron, I knew that the aeroplane had not even come yet, but, to many other passengers, this came as a most unpleasant surprise, as a lot of them seemed to have short connection times in Frankfurt. The aeroplane left with a delay of more than 30 minutes; the flight itself was quite good. In Business Class, they served a tray containing a plate with slices of roast chicken, vegetables and pesto, accompanied by some bread rolls with butter as well as some panna cotta with cherry sauce and clotted cream. For me, there was enough connecting time in Frankfurt, as I knew exactly how I could get from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 quickly. I spent some 20 minutes in the Senator Lounge. It was quite empty for that time of day. The food served reflected the fact that the Oktoberfest in Munich had started. It was all very Bavarian 每 the same you get in the Munich lounges all year round. Within the 50 minutes I was in Frankfurt, the departure gate changed at least four times from B30 to B20 to B27 and finally to B28. The flight from Frankfurt to Tivat was the real disappointment. The flight was more than twice as long as the inner-German flight from Berlin to Frankfurt, but the food served on board to Tivat was exactly the same as on the previous flight. I mean how is this possible? How can it be that Lufthansa 每 a so-called 5-star airline 每 offers the same kind of food on two different flights at two different times of day with different flight duration? Frankfurt is Lufthansa＆s main hub; the vast majority of the passengers have connecting flights here. Is that the impression Lufthansa tries to leave? Austrian, a Lufthansa-group member, is able to serve a hot meal on all international flights no matter how long it is.

We took off quickly, and it looked like an on-time arrival at FRA. The weak point is the food and food service. The flight kitchen at NBO seems to be unable to deliver quality food, at least not for business class. Compared to Swiss, which flew us to NBO, Swiss is worlds better, incl. the food.

LH appears to be losing its discipline when it comes to on time boarding and departures. On board, the hard product offered decent space for one＊s belongings but the fact that not every seat has direct aisle access remains a downside for LH business class. The seat offers limited privacy and the fact that it is angled towards the neighbour, makes it quite awkward in the fully flat position as a mere 1 inch divider separates the respective foot wells. The seat was narrow compared to business class seats found on other carriers. It was not particularly comfortable in the lie flat position. The service was in typical LH fashion, efficient but lacking warmth. The food and wine offerings were quite good however, the salad consisted of limp mesclun greens and was sort of thrown onto the tray. The snack served prior to landing was actually better tasting than the lunch offering consisting of a delicious soup and very tasty prawns. The IFE had a good selection and I especially enjoyed the cameras showing the exterior of the aircraft. The toilets were kept in immaculate condition throughout the flight.

The rules are that dogs can fly in cabin as long as they are secured in their carrier during take off and landing and when the seatbelt light goes off the dog is allowed to sit in your lap. I asked the rules several times before traveling because she hates being in a carrier and goes crazy barking and crying. I even got her tranquilizers from the vet just for her to be able to deal with those few minutes she has to be in the carrier. This is the way we traveled to Europe a few weeks ago. Nice and smooth she made it thru.  Lufthansa banned me from flying their airline because my dog, who came out of her carrier by poking her head out, mid flight and was barking! This pilot demanded At the beginning of the flight to keep her in the carrier the whole flight and told me that that is the rules. My poor dog hates being in the carrier, I probably would＊ve not brought her if that was really the rule because she barks and cries when she＊s in the carrier. I asked the pilot why he would not use his own discretion with his rules, for my dog will make the whole plane crazy by barking while being locked in a small box. It＊s the rules.  I did what he told me anyway and my dog barked for 25 minutes straight while I apologized to the other passengers. So we landed in Frankfurt to catch our connecting flight to Miami and the stewardess told me that we cannot board the plane. Mind you that flight to and from the US, ESA＊s are allowed to sit on your lap the entire flight, landing, taking off and all. I was not able to board my flight in Frankfurt and was told to order another plane ticket with another airline, and that I will not be getting a refund or will they transfer my ticket to another airline.

Hardly time to visit the toilet and certainly not opportunity to go into the Lounge. At the boarding gate I asked about my luggage and I was reassured by the staff, after checking the computer, that it had been transferred successfully to the second plane. After boarding the plane, lunch time, we were informed that there was no catering service at all due to the recurrent issue that they have had .. for over 2 months now. But being served just a wafer is totally unacceptable, they didn't make even the effort to get us a sandwich despite departing from their main hub. Credit must be given to the crew on board as they had to put up with this situation for not fault of their own but because of the incompetence and unprofessionalism of the company. To add insult to the injury my luggage didn't make it to the second plane and it was still in Frankfurt (despite being an easier journey through the airport than mine) so I had to spend another 25 extra minutes to go through the queue and forms at the baggage handling company desk in Madrid. I had to beg then for having it express delivered on that night (only Senators and HON members are entitled to such privilege) despite being Star Alliance Gold and Lufthansa Frequent Flyer. Fortunately the staff took pity of me and they managed to get it approved by Lufthansa. Needless to say that I sent the feedback form to customer services on the very same night.

I went with my wife and my son to the LH business lounge and was denied the possibility to buy access for my wife and my son because they have tickets issued by LOT. I argued that I did not book nor choose LOT as the Award tickets were issued by Lufthansa when I booked the awards. What a shame.,negative,-0.796673,0,66,10.502983,7.101676

First my seat broke in the middle of the flight and cant be repaired, I have to stay in half sitting, half laying down position the rest of the flight. Well this may be just my bad luck, but the thing really make me disappointed is the the customer service. We gave our coats to the flight attendant to hang in the closet during the flight. Both the flight attendant and we have forgotten the coats when deboarding. Later we visited the baggage claim desk and they said cant find it, I sent a request to the customer service and got a response with a case number, but did not get any response for more than a month while I keep sending email trying to get any status. Only until I sent an personal email to the CEO than I got a response which in no surprise that they no longer can find the coats. In 21st century the customer service should be on the mind of every major company, Lufthansa essentially has none. ",negative,-0.892041,0,66,10.502983,7.101676

NotVerified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Porto via Frankfurt,19-Aug,4,3,1,,1,4,1,no,2,"  My flights with Lufthansa from London to Porto via Frankfurt were a disappointment. Lufthansa currently has a problem with its catering agents - it seems that very little food is available on short-haul flights in Europe. This downgrades the flying experience to something like that of a budget airline. On the short flight from LHR to FRA passengers were given one biscuit. On the second flight from FRA to OPO we were given a chocolate bar. That's it. That was the extent of the food service on the 2 Lufthansa flights totalling more than 4 hours. Additionally, a 10-minute thunderstorm in the Frankfurt are was converted into an arrival delay of almost one hour. There was little in the way of apology from Lufthansa. The cabin crew seemed pleasant and polite enough but the overall experience was very disappointing and not something I expected from an airline with the reputation of Lufthansa.",negative,-0.906158,0,66,10.502983,7.101676

I had a very positive experience sitting on the upper deck of the B747-400, which - due to its size had a rather private feel. The seats were arranged in a 2-2 configuration, all extending to a fully flat bed. I had read mixed reviews about the seats before. Even though there are business class products which provide more privacy, I found the seats comfortable and got a good night of sleep. The food was decent even though it is better in my experience if you fly out of Frankfurt. However, what really made my flight was the impeccable service.

? Trip Verified ,A333,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Frankfurt,19-Aug,1,1,1,1,,1,1,no,1,"  I just traveled with my 16 month old infant on August 5, 2019 from Boston to Frankfurt with Lufthansa. I have chosen this airline for many years as a family friendly airline and for its reputation. Unfortunately when I traveled this time it was a total disaster leading me to write this review. I consider myself a frequent flyer, having done this trip over twenty times but never with an infant. I have a multitude of complaints including complete disregard from crew and personnel, unsanitary conditions on the flight and rude service. I am extremely disappointed and will never choose this company again after paying $1700 for this roundtrip ticket. First, I paid extra for a special seat to accommodate my daughter and I and found myself in the middle row. I understand that I chose to have her in my lap as these were the only options given to me during booking. Secondly, the staff in economy was extremely rude and unaccommodating to our situation and even refused us a bottle of water. Thirdly, the conditions in the plane were a disgrace. People were throwing up in the aisle, multiple passengers had their bare feet on the seat rests and television monitors with no consideration for others and the crew did nothing to remedy this. I was horrified at the thought of changing my infants diaper in the bathroom under these conditions. Lastly, no one showed any consideration or patience while aware that I was carrying an infant, a stroller and two carry-ons while boarding and deplaning and no one offered a seat on the bus that brought us twice to two different terminals forcing us to stand and trying not to loose our balance. I understand that I am not in control of the behavior of others, but the crew showed complete indifference towards this and lacked complete empathy for the passengers on this flight and my daughter and I. I believe that the crew's lack of care reinforced an atmosphere of total indifference. I also want to add that in Boston at the check-in I was charged an extra $60 USD for my daughters check-in baggage. I had already paid for my one check-in back at the time of booking and was not expecting this additional charge.",negative,-0.72916,0,66,10.502983,7.101676

On the ground, the lounge (TAP Lounge) offered a good variety of Food and Drinks and queues at security were short. Boarding was efficient, delivering the advertised priority boarding. On board, soon after take off, a tasty warm meal was served. Crew was awesome, adressed me by name and came around frequently. Only issue was cleanliness of the aircraft. Carpets and toilet floors had obviously earned their money. Table at Bulkhead was sticky. Seating was economy standard, the limit for this flight time (2.5 h). Wifi worked at good speed, power outlets would be really useful.  Not a five star experience,but solid four stars. Got a cheap fare.",positive,0.773133,0,66,10.502983,7.101676

Upon entering the plane, the pilot cautioned the pax that there might be some delay due to some maintenance work. An hour later he announced that a test could not be performed due to a missing tool, an hour later  a document needed to be signed my a maintenance manager in FRA to certify that the plane could fly without the test but the person could not be reached because he was sleeping. The flight was cancelled because the crew exceeded the maximum working time. LH does not have airport staff at Izmir airport. One person from the handling agent was trying to handle the 180 odd pax. It was chaos for at least 4h. She first gave a card with LH call center numbers and told us to make our own arrangements. I did that after 2h standing in an unruly mob, and I was put on a 11.30 flight, which they later changed (without my knowledge) to a 13.45 flight. I spent 13h at that dreadful airport. The flight was operated then by budget carrier Sun Express without any drinks or food. Drinks and sandwiches were offered at Izmir airport after 4h. I arrived Hamburg at 18.30 instead of 11 am.

Business class were unattended for nearly 15 minutes. I spoke with the purser, and he told me that was Lufthansa?s procedure.

I was supposed to fly with Lufthansa from Copenhagen to Madrid, but due to a delay on a connecting flight, I never arrived to Copenhagen and made it to my flight, I was therefore forced to rebook my flight ticket with another company to arrive to my final destination. The problem arises three days later when I had to check in to my return flight with Lufthansa, my return flight ticket has been canceled without noticing me, since I did not board the outgoing flight from Copenhagen. They canceled my return ticket without even informing me. This meant that I had to look for a new flight less than 24 hours of my departure. ",negative,-0.912225,0,66,10.502983,7.101676

Lufthansa flies old A340's in service for 22+ years, and their age, wear and tear show. The seats are frayed and torn, and cushions hard and in need of replacing. The food borders on inedible for me. The staff were very senior which is not bad, but some appear indifferent. I would describe the service as grudgingly pleasant bordering on not-caring. The pluses are a great IFE system, punctuality, nice touches like a pillow and blanket for each seat, a clean aircraft and complementary drinks. These little pluses are far overshadowed by its negatives. This is my fifth LH flight in the past 15 months. This may be my last.",negative,-0.484159,0,66,10.502983,7.101676

? Trip Verified ,A320 / Boeing 747-8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Los Angeles via Frankfurt,19-Jul,1,2,1,1,1,2,2,no,2,"  Copenhagen to Los Angeles via Frankfurt. I have found Lufthansa becoming more and inconsistent in their performance. On the first leg, we had secured nice exit seats with plenty of leg space, to be told at the gate that we had instead been upgraded to business class. However, this is is the first time in 25 years of travel that I get an upgrade, and the service offering is a down-grade. First off, the seat pitch is less than in economy class (compared to the exit seats we had). Then, it turns out that there is not enough business class catering, so  we each get a KitKat snack to keep us happy. Suffice to say that If I can afford to pay more than 1000 USD for a ticket, I can afford to buy an unhealthy snack for 50 cents. The purser expressed that she was ""sorry"". I acknowledge her statement, but I would much more appreciate her fixing the problem. The long-haul portion of the trip was average. The IFE and power supply did not work for me and the people sitting next to me, and it took the crew hours to figure this out. I had ordered Lufthansa's a la carte dining, which has been very good in the past. Today, parts of the meal were very unattractive. I cannot believe that they have the heart to charge 30 EUR for a rip-off of this sort. A final observation from the long-haul part was that we spent almost an hour holding at the tarmac at LAX, after landing, before finally arriving at our gate This was handled very poorly by the cabin team. I was for instance able to get off the plane before almost all premium passengers. In conclusion, not Lufthansa's finest day, by far. Would I fly them again? Perhaps, but they would not be my first choice, and they are not a five-star airline.",negative,-0.563407,0,66,10.502983,7.101676
