✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Frankfurt,Jun-24,2,5,,,,2,1,no,1,"  I paid for emergency exit seats, Lufthansa changed planes and gave us 2 seats in normal seats. I did not notice this at check in, and at the gate I asked for my emergency seats. They said the plane was full, and to please ask for a refund online. Lufthansa answered with very poorly written mails, and plainly refused a refund (here is the text of the mail I received: ""Our decision has been carefully considered, taking into account, Of course, our decision was made after assessing carefully considering the legal liability along with goodwill considerations. Therefore, we kindly request your understanding that we choose to uphold our decision and consider the case closed"" Luckily Expedia was nice enough to give me a credit for the same amount for use in future travel. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Venice to Frankfurt,Jul-24,4,1,1,,3,2,2,no,2,"  Flight was delayed by about 1 hour. An excuse for the inconvenience for transit passengers? No. LH no longer seems to be interested in how passengers are doing. When disembarking, the captain and flight attendant stand next to each other at the door, but instead of saying goodbye to the paying passenger, they prefer to talk about evening programs after work.  But the tip of the iceberg was the stand-by flight attendant in uniform who complained about children on board. Not a single child screamed, but was simply a happy child.  LH urgently needs to work on the service and the staff."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Malaga,Jul-24,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," Flight cancelled due to a delay leading to the crew unable to continue flying, no replacement crew available. The ""service centers"" at the airport so overwhelmed by stranded travelers or rather so undermanned that there was an hours long wait time to get a waiting number. Beyond belief. Got an alternative flight only 3 days later, and of course no compensation offered by the airline. Our luggage has been taken hostage for those 3 days since we weren't willing to queue up again for hours at the luggage counter. This airline doesn't deserve its 4 Stars, this is an insult to any quality airline. Their service has been steadily deteriorating over the past 10 years and has now reached the level of the worst budget airlines but still at a premium price. Delays and cancellations are rather the rule than the exception by now, the service hotlines even for frequent flyers are unreachable and incompetent. Even cattle on their way to the slaughterhouse are treated better. Avoid this airline if possible by any means!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Palermo to Hamburg,Jun-24,3,4,,,,1,4,no,3," Our recent experience with Lufthansa has been extremely disappointing. On both legs of our journey, we faced significant issues. On June 6th, during our flight from Hamburg (HAM) to Palermo (PMO), our luggage was delayed and did not arrive with us. We had to wait for several days without our belongings, and the only reason we retrieved it sooner was due to my trip back to the airport. The return trip was equally problematic. After a delayed arrival in Munich on June 28th, one of our three pieces of luggage did not make the connecting flight to Hamburg. We received no information about its whereabouts until July 1st, and it was only delivered on July 2nd, after numerous failed attempts to contact the delivery company. The system used by Lufthansa to track luggage is utterly useless, providing no updates other than stating the luggage is being searched. The response from Lufthansa was not customer-friendly, showing no acceptance of responsibility and offering no compensation without receipts, which is merely a legal requirement. The fact that such issues occurred on both flights highlights significant problems in the logistics and capabilities of Lufthansa in providing reliable service. Overall, this demonstrates a lack of care and poor customer service from Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to New York via Frankfurt,Jun-24,2,4,1,1,1,2,2,no,2," I stopped flying Lufthansa 15 years ago and now I remember why. All four flights (departure + connection) and the same on the return flight were delayed. On the outbound flight, we missed the connecting flight to New York. There was absolutely no staff waiting at the gate to direct us to our gate or even escort us as I've seen many times when a connecting flight is delayed. Everything around our gate was closed at 5pm in the evening? No staff, no information kiosk, no ticketing agent, no Lufthansa staff in Frankfurt, the airlines hub city!? When I was finally able to connect to wifi and look online for our gate and we ran to it, the plane had just closed boarding. Had there been an escort, we might have made it. The rebooking agent acted like he was doing us a favor by putting us in a hotel for the night and told me I shouldn't have booked such a close connection - excuse me sir, your company shouldn't have close connection times if they can't fulfill the obligation. On the way back another late flight and just narrowly made the connection but of course the luggage did not. I had another flight and just one day to receive my luggage before leaving. Of course it did not arrive until midnight the day after landing. I waited all day and had to rush and pack for my flight early the next morning. In addition to their time management problems, the planes were old, the entertainment system ancient, the food was horrible and the customer service useless. I suppose I just needed to be reminded why I avoid Lufthansa at all costs. Well done LH."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Belgrade to Edinburgh via Frankfurt, Munich",Jul-24,1,3,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  All the worst. All 4 of my flights were delayed, the first trip BEL-EDI was supposed to last 5h and it lasted 25h. They refuse to compensate me because it was due to a ""bird strike"". "
Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Manchester to Bari via Munich,Jul-24,1,3,,,,1,1,no,1,"   If I could, I would give them 0 for their appalling customer service and absolutely lack of care for their customers. I lost my flight connection because of a delay. Certainly, delays can happen this is indisputable. However, they left us to sleep on the floor and their staff on the plane lied by stating that my flight connection had not departed.  They have rebooked me on two flights and one is not a business class despite I paid for this class. Now this means that on one of their flights I will not be able to carry 2 bags on despite I paid for them and I need in order to do some medications. I will never travel with them again. The staff in Munich was rude and unprofessional. Today there were only 3 people at the desk despite there was a long queue of poor customers who needed to rebook their flights connection. I have booked a return flight with them but no way I will travel with them again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Barcelona,Mar-24,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," Attention, Lufthansa tries to screw you over if they have the chance. Here is my terrible experience: - Lufthansa informed me via mail on 13.03 that I was rebooked from my original flight on 14.03, which I had already checked in for, to an alternative flight on 15.03 for no reason - Lufthansa employees on the service telephone were also unable to reverse this on 13.03 and gave me various incorrect reasons such as the flight was canceled or fully booked, although it was taking place and could still be booked via their own Lufthansa website - I therefore had to book the original flight on 14.03 a second time via their own Lufthansa website as an alternative to the exact same denied original flight. I took my original 14.03. flight on that second booking - due to Lufthansa's incompetence, they owe me compensation for the entire ticket price of the second booking for the same original flight - Lufthansa denied that request multiple times. This practice is more deceptive than that of our well known low-cost carriers. I find it appalling how customers are treated and I would recommend anyone to choose another airline if possible."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sarajevo to Frankfurt,Jul-24,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,2," Scheduled a 2.5 hour flight looking to receive some refreshments. Come to find out ordering a Coke I had to pay for that unexpectedly. Picking seats you have to pay to change seats. Find there is a fee to check any luggage. Very disappointing how any convenience you wish to have now is gone, might as well book Spirit Airlines if I have to pay for things. Delayed on takeoff and delayed to get off the plane. Had to wait on the tarmac to get bussed to the gate. What a disappointment."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Lisbon,Jul-24,3,2,1,,,5,3,no,6,"  The flight from Munich was delayed by almost an hour which is actually a good thing as my flight to Munich was late due to thunderstorms. The flight attendant announced with some fanfare on the loud speaker that Lufthansa has rolled out a new system of offering water, a tea or coffee. This was a subtle way to break the news that no free food of any kind is given (not even a snack) and sending a message to customers that they should suffice with only one drink. The distribution of that one drink per passenger started late (not due to turbulence) and was proceeding very slowly. I waited an hour and 50 minutes after take off to receive a drink. The seats are well padded but I don't know if they are more spacious than those of low cost airlines. The crew did not seem to have any sandwiches to sell (I think they were short on them) but they did have plenty of crisps, pretzels etc.  The highlight of the trip was the Lindt chocolate at the end."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Riyadh,Jun-24,3,4,3,,,1,1,no,1,"  Flying out of Riyadh delayed by 3 hours and missed connection.. The LH employee at Riyadh did not do anything although i informed them before boarding, in Frankfurt agent told me next day flight and i don't have guarantee for hotel because of Euro championship, or i have to take Airbaltic and she asked me to go to their office. I realized that airbaltic in another terminal and nobody in their counter because their flight will be after 7 hours. After arrival to destination they lost my baggage. Flying back no boarding pass for connection and nothing at their app and I have to go to their office in FRA. The crew was good and helpful. Problem is mainly ground crew and agents."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Cologne to Ancona via Munich,Jun-24,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Cancelled my flight with no notice and offered a replacement which would have meant missing an important appointment. I was forced to make alternative travel arrangements with another airline and Lufthansa refuse to reimburse expenses. Customer service is uncaring, unwilling to engage, and peddles inaccuracies. "
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Tbilisi,Jul-24,2,3,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Horrible company, no meals onboard, and also when you have 7 hours gap for transit flights no meals no nothing. Nothing is free for them or no bonuses, was such a good company but now it is the worst. Shame on you"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Zagreb via Munich,Jul-24,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Most horrible airline I have ever experienced. I don't even know how this airline is functioning. *ALL FOUR* of our flights through Lufthansa were majorly delayed - over 16 HOURS of delay time, causing us to miss an entire vacation day and our means of transportation. Hundreds of people had also missed their connectors and the line for customer service was a 3 hour wait. One of our connectors was SIX HOURS and we still missed it because they cancelled our tickets. They say to check the app but it doesn't update so it is useless. Not only that, but my husband paid EXTRA for seats to be next to each other and they gave our seats together away to a family without telling or asking us. We didn’t know until we were about to board - nor did we get any sort of refund. If you want to arrive within a day of when you expect to arrive to your vacation then don't book through this trash of an airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Zagreb to Bremen via München,Jun-24,3,3,4,1,3,4,1,no,1," Our flight yesterday was canceled and unfortunately we were not automatically rebooked. You can't clarify things properly with the chatbot, because you write that you are at Munich Airport and the chatbot replies ""Are you at Franjo Tudman Airport?"". Unfortunately, this was also not possible by phone, with the explanation that we had checked in our luggage and therefore could not be rebooked. We had to wait for hours in an incredibly long queue until the counter was able to rebook us and give us a hotel voucher. After hours of waiting, we were told in the terminal that Lufthansa would close the desk at 11pm and we would have to book a hotel room ourselves and stay awake at night waiting for the email from Lufthansa announcing the new flight. They just let hundreds of people down by not working. Pick your own hotel, even though all the hotels in Munich were fully booked. A Lufthansa employee in Munich laughed at us and sarcastically said to us, ""We have nice cozy pillows and blankets, you can sleep here at the airport"". In the end, we were lucky and booked the last room in a nearby hotel via Booking. We paid for the cab (€120 to the hotel and back the next day) and the hotel itself. The next day there was another surprise - first our flight was 2 hours late, and then the flight was canceled again, we were not informed about this either by SMS or by email. It was a coincidence that we wanted to check the status in the LH app. We were rebooked on a flight at 10pm. We have no deodorant, no toothbrush, have been traveling in the same clothes for more than 24 hours and the question arises whether this flight will take place at all or will be canceled again. This may mean deja vu - standing in the long queue again and in the end, when they close the counter at 11 pm, you have to worry about where you can sleep, how to get to the hotel and whether there is anything else near the airport, you have to pay for everything yourself of course. There is also the frustration of not knowing how long you will have to chase your money. The worst experience ever, I wouldn't recommend anyone to fly with Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Casablanca to Austin via Frankfurt,Jun-24,3,3,3,,,2,2,no,3,"  I recently relocated from Morocco back to the US after living there for 5 years. I also flew my 2 Moroccan cats which I took in while living there. Because I had 2 cats I had to buy 2 seats and fly a second person with me. Each ticket had 1 checked bag and I added an additional checked bag to each ticket for 4 checked bags. I didn’t want to rebuy every thing so I took the important stuff. Because I also wanted to take some textiles I had previously purchased I called Lufthansa to ask how much it would be to add a 3rd checked bag to one ticket. I was told over the phone the 3rd bag would be $110. I confirmed this price several times with the phone rep. However when I arrived to the airport in Casablanca from Marrakech where I was actually coming from the ticket counter took all my luggage and proceeded to charge me around $350 for that 3rd piece of luggage. I told them many times I was told $110 for the 3rd piece of luggage, they 100% did not GAF and I was forced to pay what they asked. Mind you I already spent + $1300 for the two tickets, and $220 for the two cats, and $180 for the two extra pieces of luggage I added. I filed a complaint and they tried to gaslight me telling me my luggage was “overweight” and this is why they charged ~$250 more (everything was in a different currency). I personally weighed all my luggage multiple times before arriving to the airport AND the airport told me the cost was due to the 3rd piece of luggage. Nothing was ever said related to my luggage being overweight. On top of this I tried to upgrade my tickets to see if that would be the cheapest way to have more luggage, I was told I could upgrade but the amount of checked luggage would be based on the ticket class I originally bought. And, on the first of the two flights my cats were forced to be separated despite me paying to have the two seats together. Even I was pressured by the airline rep to buy my seats because he told me even buying the tickets together wasn’t a guarantee we would be seated together. What a load this company is. "
Not Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Ankara,Jun-24,1,2,1,2,,1,1,no,1," I flew Lufthansa and SunExpress which is joint venture of Turkish Airlines and Lufthansa from Boston to Ankara at 2nd of Jun 2024 and from Ankara to Boston at 23rd of Jun 2024. Both of my flights with Lufthansa delayed my luggage. On my first flight the whole flights luggage was left in Munich airport and I received my luggage 3 days later. My current flight my luggage was left in Munich airport. As I learned Lufthansa are suffering lack of ground service personnel in Munich airport, yet they are using one of the biggest plane (A380 capacity of 525) and it was full."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Milan via Munich,Jun-24,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I had booked tickets from Brussels to Milan via Munich. When I reached Munich, I was told that the next flight to Milan l has been cancelled and they didn't tell what to do next. I was standing in queue in front of their help desk and at last one alternate flight was arranged but that too got delayed several times. At last we reached Milan 8 hours late."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Rome via Frankfurt,Jun-24,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"   This is my first and last time flying Lufthansa! Paid extra for seat assignment. Seats were changed 4 times to then have us on the 4th change to not sit together. SFO to Frankfurt to Rome. SFO to Frankfurt’s reassigned seats were up against a wall, 3 seat reclined one inch, 4th seat did not recline at all, for 11 hours. Remember that I paid extra to not get the seats I wanted. Check in attendants were the rudest I have experienced.  Take off was delayed. The flight attendants were not friendly. My son asked for ice tea and the stewardess literally snapped at him, “No”. Arrived in Frankfurt after 11 hours, connected on to the next flight to then be asked to disembark due to a door issue. Again, rude counter attendants the caused mass confusion when trying to update the passengers. Everyone stormed the counter. What they wanted was 70 volunteers to get off the flight with a 250 voucher. Because they caused so much confusion, the counter attendants started yelling and threatening all of us that if we didn’t cooperate that they would just cancel the flights altogether.  They couldn’t get 70 people, they got 50, and then started to pull the rest of the people the next flight.  Once that happened, we were able to board. Once seated, the captain came on and said that the counter attendants miscounted and still needed 10 people to get off so they randomly selected another 10 people.  I was supposed to arrive in Rome today at two but I am still seated waiting to take off because now they are questioning the load of people and where we are all seating. I have never experienced such rudeness, disorganized, and horrible treatment of their passengers. I would like a refund for paying for seat selection early when I didn’t get any of the seats I wanted from SFO to Frankfurt due to the 4 x that we were moved and ultimately to a horrible seat situation"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-400 / A340-600,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Hong Kong via Frankfurt,Jun-24,4,4,4,4,,3,4,yes,8,"  Flew from YYZ to HKG via FRA due to its cheaper tickets. It's my first time flying with Lufthansa and their B747-400. Their performance are basically satisfactory. Both planes in my flight are quite old but they are still clean and comfortable to stay in. The quality of IFE is ok and has a wide variety of movie selections. The meals for the flight from YYZ-FRA are satisfactory, yet the meal (chicken rice) from FRA-HKG is not very appealing to me. For such a long flight, their seats on both B747-400 and A340-600 are better than what I expected through reading online reviews. Overall speaking, their service is not comparable to the top-tier airlines but it's not bad and certainly has good value to money for my flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to London via Munich,Jun-24,2,1,1,2,,3,3,no,4,"  I wasn't permitted to check in online. No choice of seating. Seats less than avarage leg space and minimal recline. Seat pocket tiny and difficult to access. Video screen was small with a fair if not unspectacular selection of choices. Avarage earphones. Blanket length was short. I usually enjoy my inflight meals but this one was awful. I couldn't eat the main meal. In nonveg they said eggs, no meat but I am not sure it had any eggs. Toilets were good and clean. 7 out of 10. Staff did not seem particularly interested in serving. My journey involved transiting through Munich. No issues with bags. I first flew LH from Manchester to New York in 2007 and last in 2017 between Bombay to London. Much worse experience now compared to my earlier flights."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Budapest via Munich,Jun-24,1,2,1,2,,1,1,no,1," I had already sworn off of flying LH whenever possible, following their years long race to the bottom. Particularly bothersome to me are the narrow seat pitch in long haul Economy (impossible to open a laptop), tiny seat pockets large enough to fit, like, two bonbons, absence of reasonable Economy+ type seating, and downgrading of my home airport (PHL) to their Eurowings Discover division and its truly inedible food. But despite my better judgement, my wife made me give them another chance on our TATL flight this month, and oh boy, LH did not disappoint in showing how truly awful they are. In addition to all of the above (which makes it super uncomfortable to get work done on a computer), they enforce an absurd Ryanair-style 18 lbs carry-on size limit coupled with dimension limits that fit toy bags. Despite me explaining that in my reasonably sized standard carryon (which was under 20 lbs) I am carrying bare essentials to keep my special needs 4-year old manageable for a 24-hour trip and that this was the only carryon bag for three paying passengers combined, they made me empty everything into what was essentially one grocery-sized plastic bag: passports, diapers, medications, sleeping needs, children books, toddler food, water, one change of kid clothes — everything in one jumble. With this Hansel and Gretel type bag of overstuffed chaos I proceeded through several airports and planes courtesy of LH while my essentially empty carryon traveled checked in and the overhead bins were empty as well. The same farce was repeated on the way back, with the added twist that the plane experienced a technical defect that caused a 2.5 hour delay for which they issued us — after the late flight had boarded — 10 EUR meal vouchers which wouldn’t have been good for anything anyway since the US bound flight section had only one counter which had quickly run out of food. They also forbade the use of an FAA approved seat belt for my child on all flights, citing German regulations. LH is now strictly back in the banned category for me. I get that all of these things might have been in some conditions of carriage that I accepted by buying the LH ticket. Fine. But I have my own conditions of carriage, and as long as there is competent competition — I will not make the LH mistake again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Santorini,Jun-24,2,4,,,,1,1,no,1," I booked a flight through Lufthansa for my brother and sister to travel with me to Santorini. I tried to check in online, but it wasn't working, so I had to go to the airport counter. At the airport, I went to the Discover Airlines self-check-in machine, as my flight was operated by them, and it gave me an error. The staff at Discover Airlines directed me to the Lufthansa counter. The Lufthansa attendant attempted to check us in but also failed and sent me back to Discover Airlines. At the Discover Airlines counter, the assistant tried to generate my siblings' boarding passes but faced issues. After involving a supervisor and a 20-minute wait, another supervisor managed to resolve the problem. They then hurriedly told us to run as we were late, despite the delays being their fault. We suspect the system crash was due to purchasing my siblings' tickets with my credit card, which should have been an easy issue to resolve. After a lot of stress, we barely made it to the plane on time for takeoff. Now, I'm sitting on a super hot plane waiting for departure, and we've been told we have to wait another 20 minutes in the sun because around 50 bags are missing. I can't believe my poor siblings have to fly back to Frankfurt with this airline. I wish I could rate it a 0. If you have ANY other option, choose it. Avoid ruining your travel experience with this airline's incompetence."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Frankfurt,Jun-24,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," The computers at the business class checkin desk was not working, so ended up waiting for more than 30 minutes, whilst the staff would go back and forth the automatic checkin kiosks. My seat was dirty and my chicken salad which did not have much vegetables and was awful. It took a long time for the bags to arrive. Will avoid Lufthansa at all costs. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Barcelona via Munich,May-24,4,4,3,4,,5,4,yes,7,"   We flew Lufthansa for a second time, this time was long haul flight from BKK to BCN via MUC. The check-in and boarding was smooth. The aircraft was quite new and keep the noise in the cabin quite low. The seat was nice and comfort with very good leg room but recline not very much as we expected therefore we did not catch much sleep during night flight to Munich. The cabin crew was nice and professional. The food and drink was quite a little disappionted as the taste was not very good. No snack or fruit provided during flight. The flight was late about 30 minutes but we had no problem connecting flight.The flight from MUC to BCN was a medium haul flight flown by Airbus A321. Nothing was special. We were served with a bottle of water and small chocolate bar. The crew as quite friendlier than flight from BKK. Overall, it was OK but not up to our expectations."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tehran to Birmingham via Frankfurt,Apr-24,3,2,2,1,1,2,2,no,1," Awful service. Cancelled my flight 2 times without an apology. Flight delayed by 2 days. After the second cancellation they just said that I would have wait until they tell me if a an alternative is found. So you can imagine the uncertainty and anxiety. On my return I wrote an email complaining but they arrogantly replied that because my return flight was from outside EU, I don't have any rights. My brother was travelling with the same airline and he wanted to change his departure date by one day and they charged him $500!!"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,Jun-24,1,1,3,4,,1,3,no,1,"   Extremely disappointed about this airline. After I paid for upgrade seat for a bulk head so I’m not restrain by anyone in front of me, having an 8hr flight, they change the aircraft and they atomically switch my seat in the middle of the plane between everyone. I called the airline once I received the email and they were the worst customer service ever. They hang up on me, then they said they can do anything, then they said I have to pay extra and hang up on me and at the airport they said they can’t do anything because the flight is full. The worst. Why do you give me the option upgrading my seat if you can provide the service. Worst airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Tivat to Heathrow,Jun-24,1,3,2,1,1,1,1,no,1," We experienced a nightmare with Lufthansa. We had a connection. The first flight was delayed, and they did not wait or direct us. The problem started from then on. They are too rude. They claimed it was very average daily problem. They have not assisted or helped. We had to stay at Frankfurt Airport overnight. They almost claimed we were responsible, not Lufthansa. They even treated my 6 years old very badly. I am not expecting corporate responsibility; they do not have minimum human empathy. Stay away from Lufthansa as much you can."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 737,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Ankara via Munich,Jun-24,1,3,3,3,,1,1,no,1, I flew with Lufthansa from Boston to Ankara. There is one stop in Munich. The second airline which flew from Munich to Ankara is Sun Express under Lufthansa. This flight lost the whole planes luggage. The plane had 3 hours overlay and arrived to Ankara without passengers luggage. I haven't faced anything like this before and I don't think I will choose Lufthansa again.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Paris via Munich,Dec-23,,,,,,1,1,no,2,  Lufthansa cancelled my flight the day of the departure. I sent an email for compensation which they replied i am entitled to a compensation fee of 1000$. That was 6 months ago and i sent multiple emails which they have been asking banking information to receive the compensation amount but they never did since they confirmed it. I called them multiple times too but they said to wait for a response by email. Still no refund.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Prague,Apr-24,3,3,2,4,,1,2,no,1,"   The flight left from Munich without any luggages. None were boarded, and we were told only when we were waiting at the carousel at Prague airport. I got my luggage 24 hours later and Lufthansa refused to reimburse the amount paid to check the luggage. In my opinion, reimbursing that amount would have been the least they could do for the problems this delay caused."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Paris to Mumbai,May-24,4,4,3,3,,4,4,yes,7," Excellent Crew. There should be more options / variety to the food. Don't know if it's only on this route (India) or it's on their every flight / route. If it's on every flight route, they must change their policy and have more options in the food. In terms of Food, Singapore Airlines is the best. Limited inflight entertainment. In the name of latest releases, showing old movies that they have added recently. No Anime. Wish management can take a notice of it."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,"Calgary, Alberta to Frankfurt, Germany",May-24,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,no,1," If you are flying with a family, DO NOT fly with Lufthansa assuming you can reserve seats together. The organization of these flights are horrible, last minute changes to aircrafts occur consistently and your seats are then randomized. We originally reserved bassinet capable seats, but once seats were shuffled we lost that. We also reserved seats that were together, we lost that too. They will leave your reservation customizations up in the air until the day of your flight when you check in and HOPEFULLY you can get the seats you originally reserved. The overall experience was terrible due to their ""last minute aircraft changes"". BEWARE if you choose to fly with them."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787-9 / A330-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Dubai via Frankfort,May-24,1,3,3,1,2,2,3,no,2,"  I recently booked a ticket with Lufthansa for a trip from Denver, Colorado to Dubai, with a connection in Frankfurt. I was traveling with my infant baby, toddler, and child, and had specifically ordered a bassinet for my baby. However, my experience was far from what I expected from a reputed airline. Upon reaching the airport counter for check-in, I was shocked to find out that my ticket did not show up in their system. After several attempts to resolve the issue, I was informed that my ticket was a stand-by ticket. This was a huge surprise and extremely distressing, especially considering I had booked a normal ticket for myself and my young children. The entire process took over two hours, during which we were left standing on our feet with no assistance or consideration for our situation. When we were finally boarded, we were given seats separated from each other, all the way at the back of the plane. This made the journey difficult as the crew was unaccommodating and showed little concern for our needs as a family traveling with small children. When we arrived in Frankfurt, the nightmare continued. Once again, we were told that we did not have a boarding pass for the next leg of our journey. After another round of confusion and waiting, we were again given separate seats, which was highly inconvenient and stressful. This entire experience was one of the worst travel scenarios I have ever encountered. The lack of organization, empathy, and basic customer service from Lufthansa was deeply disappointing. Traveling with young children is challenging enough without having to deal with such chaos and unprofessionalism. I would strongly reconsider flying with Lufthansa in the future based on this experience."
Not Verified ,A320 / Boeing 747-8i,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Berlin to Chicago via Frankfurt,Apr-24,3,3,1,2,1,1,3,no,2,"   After an enjoyable experience on Lufthansa going to Germany I had high hopes for my return flight. However the airline did not come close to meeting the expectations I had from my earlier flight. Ground staff boarding the flight from Berlin to Frankfurt were extremely rude and the one male ground staff took my boarding passes and passport because my hand baggage was 1/4 kilogram overweight. Although I was in the wrong about my baggage that is no grounds to take a traveler's passport and refuse to return it. Cabin crew on the Berlin to Frankfurt flight were incredibly rude, and unhelpful. After a mess of a layover in Frankfurt, we only just made our connection to Chicago. The premium economy class seat was comfortable and crew were nice and quite helpful. The food served on this flight was not good, asian chicken that was sweet, with undercooked rice and vegetables. Overall I was appalled by Berlin ground staff service and by the cabin service onboard my Berlin to Frankfurt flight, I have tried to file official complaints but have not heard back from the company."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Frankfurt via Vienna,May-24,3,3,3,3,3,5,3,yes,7," I am in possession of 6 e-vouchers and would have liked to use them on my forthcoming trip from Bangkok to Frankfurt as upgrade from Y to C class. Unfortunately, using these vouchers is like playing lottery: you have first to book (and pay) a flight, and then, only then are you told if an upgrade is possible. As I was flexible with my dates, I asked the (friendly) desk person if it was possible to tell me if there were flights where an upgrade could be envisaged, but even that was not possible. As a result, I booked my flights (booking code: ULCOQ3), and had the huge disappointment to learn that no such upgrade was possible; I could manage nevertheless to book an upgrade on the leg VIE to BKK from economy to premium economy, against payment of course. If I had known in advance that no upgrade was possible using vouchers, I surely would have flown Finnair, where a decently priced premium economy is offered. I am again very disappointed by the attitude of Lufthansa (last time was in July, where Lufthansa almost ruined the holidays of my family by canceling a flight BRU-MUC and refused to pay any decent compensation) No wonder that the Middle East airlines have such a success."

I paid 12,500 Swedish crowns for an intercontinental ticket Sto-Bkk - Bkk-Sto and luggage was not included on the fare I bought. I've been traveling for 40 years and nothing like this has ever happened to me. With the same money or less, I could have traveled with Thai Airways, direct travel and with all the services on board and on the ground. Clearly, I will never fly with Lufthansa again."

My flight was constantly changed before departure. On the day of departure, there was even more delays, so I could not transfer to Seoul immediately and was forced to stay for more than 6 hours. I applied for a certificate of delay and did not write down the reason. I was unable to apply for insurance compensation without replying to many emails. The service was extremely poor."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Singapore via Frankfurt,Mar-24,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Board flight Manchester. Other people in our seats. Steward advises we take seats at back. I point out we have just an hour to change flights in Frankfurt to Singapore flight. Steward insists plenty of time. Doctor called to passenger take off delayed by 40 mins. Arrive in Frankfurt and I again point out our very tight change over. My husband and I finally get off plane and run to gate, about a mile away. We are both 70 this year. Passed by people who took our seat bring given buggy through airport. They are much younger than us. Arrive at gate but checkin manager day's she can't let either of us board because I do not have a visa for Vietnam. I point out I have paid Lufthansa to get me to Singapore where I can sort out my issue with my Visa with my daughter who lives in Vietnam and my son who lives in Singapore. Other passengers board as checkin staff refuse to let us board n tell us our luggage has been removed from flight and plane has taken off. They kept our suitcases. We walk back to find Lufthansa Service Desk where staff say we should have been allowed to fly. They book us in to a hotel for the night and book us on board flight to depart evening of 27th March, a day late for our connection to Vietnam. They said as our suitcases had been checked through they would make sure they were on our flight. Every member of Lufthansa staff was rude and arrogant towards us. We asked to check our suitcases were definitely on board at Lufthansa Service Desk before checkin. They were rude and treated our concern about our luggage with distain. We requested an upgrade given the treatment we had received. Checkin manager threatens my husband and myself with not allowing either my husband or myself fly because she says ""we don't have visas"" and there is no way she will give us upgrades. It was only me that needed a Visa EU passport my husband didn't and my daughter had by that stage obtained one, which would have been available if we had been allowed to board our original flight. We had to rearrange our Vietnam flight n first seats available were not until the Friday 28th March from Singapore so we had to spend Thursday 28th March in a hotel in Singapore. As we go to claim our luggage in Singapore on arrival my suitcase is missing. Singapore Lost luggage can say categorically that my case was not on our flight. We ring Lufthansa Frankfurt who say it's probably gone for good. I spend Friday 29th March shopping for clothes in Singapore. I borrow a suitcase from my son and we checkin for our Vietnam flight, two suitcases. As we had time I returned to Singapore Airport Lost luggage. A very helpful member of Singapore airport staff found my suitcase which had been put on the Tuesday 26th March flight, the one neither myself or my husband were permitted to board. I then had to check in a 3rd suitcase for our Vietnam flight at cost of £100. I have spent over a week trying to negotiate adequate compensation from Lufthansa. I have been assured by Lufthansa Customer Services staff that the cost of rearranging Vietnam flight, the cost of a hotel in Singapore, the cost of checking in a 3rd suitcase, the cost of taxi to and from hotel in Singapore are not their responsibility and they will only pay half the cost of the replacement clothes ."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Bucharest via Munich,Apr-24,3,2,1,,,1,2,no,4," Facts: - Flight LX1100 was delayed leaving from Zurich by approx. 40 minutes. Reason given: ""Waiting for passengers from a connecting flight"" - Landed in Munich when the connecting flight LH1650 to Bucharest was already boarding - No staff at the gate to expedite transfer to connecting flight - While making my way to the gate got message that I had been re-booked for another flight 6 and a half hours later - Flight LH1650 was therefore not delayed to ""wait for passengers from a connecting flight"" - Lufthansa Start Alliance Service Desk in Munich terminal K was not able to help with re-booking on an earlier direct flight. The only options presented were to take another connecting flight with a short (and risky) layover through Frankfurt or Belgrade. - Lufthansa Start Alliance Service Desk in Munich terminal K was not able to offer a reasonable or informative reason why some flights are delayed to wait for passengers and others are not. The answer they gave was: ""I don't know, this decision isn't made here. Could be any number of reasons."" - Lufthansa Start Alliance Service Desk in Munich terminal K also not able to offer any complimentary service (e.g. access to lounge, ticket to Munich to see the city, some sort of entertainment, or even more basic water or food) for the 6 and a half hours delay that I am forced to be here. - Feedback from does not pick up my Miles and More details even though I am logged in as I complete this form. It does for the bookings but not for the feedback. Consequences: - Anger for being treated differently than the passengers for which my flight was delayed departing out of Zurich - Wasted time: 6 and a half hours in Munich airport - Wasted money in the airport - Stress and frustration of having to re-book all plans for the day. I will have lost 6 and a half hours in which I had other appointments at the destination. - Frustration for not being given any reasonable or informative information or alternative flights at the Lufthansa Star Alliance Service Desk - Suspect the reason why my details are not picked up on the feedback form is because of lack of interest in gathering feedback. - Frustration and anger for having to waste even more time to fill out forms and leave reviews to be heard instead of being treated with empathy by a human at the service desk. - Dissapointment for having been forcefully put through this experience Question I now ask myself: Why do I have a Miles & More membership and will often pay more to book with member airlines? Conclusion: when flying Lufthansa with Star Alliance - Connection of 45 minutes are not enough for a transfer between member airline flights - Flights may or may not wait for passengers from connecting flights. It is unknown how this choice is made. - Passengers will not be treated like a human with empathy but like a number with a ticket in a queue - In case of delayed arrival there will be no effort made to expedite transfer to the connecting flight. - Service desk staff don't have the training/ courtesy/ means to offer adequate information or complimentary services, and lack the basic people skills for customer service: patience, problem-solving, empathy, adaptability. - In case deemed necessary by the system you will be automatically re-booked with no warning, advice, or choice. - Lufthansa with Star Alliance does not equal more reliable travel experience or better service."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Sofia,Apr-24,5,5,2,3,4,4,3,yes,7,"  It is often the crew making a flight memorable and not the airline. Lufthansa’s minimalistic approach in Tourist Class challenges my goodwill to express anything positive. But as I could experience on this flight, the crew can make a difference and made it all extremely pleasant. A warm welcome (calling me by name) and being valued as loyal customer. Flying 50 flights a year (intercontinental in Business and within Europe in Economy) with Lufthansa in the last five years, this is the second time having been treated nicely in Eco. The gold frequent flyer Senator status can be seen by the crew on the passenger list and one wonders why a small courtesy, is something to write about. However, thank you dear crew, on this flight you made Lufthansa special again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Budapest to Frankfurt,Apr-24,2,3,2,,,1,1,no,1,"  Horrible experience. Never flying with them ever again. Missed 2 connecting United Airlines flights and got home 26 hours later than actual date. Made us spend us so much more money on other things like dinner, lunch. No compensation for anything. Missed work for a day and next day got home around midnight. Disappointed beyond words.  No accountability or help at all. No value for people's time, money and lives."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Buenos Aires to Frankfurt,Apr-24,3,2,2,1,3,2,3,no,4,"  My experience with this airline left a lot to be desired, especially considering the length of the flight - 17 hours from Frankfurt to Buenos Aires. Firstly, the lack of children's headphones has caused additional inconvenience during the flight, especially for parents who want to provide comfort for their children. Furthermore, the airline's promised gift remained just a promise, which caused disappointment for both us and our children. Secondly, the children's meal was far from ideal. Not only did the quality leave something to be desired, but the selection was also extremely limited. This created additional difficulties for parents trying to accommodate the tastes of their little passengers. Overall, my experience with this airline was anything but pleasant. The insufficient attention to children and their needs greatly spoiled the impression of the flight. I do not recommend this airline to families with children who are looking for a pleasant trip. Meine Erfahrung mit dieser Fluggesellschaft ließ viel zu wünschen übrig, insbesondere angesichts der Länge des Fluges – 17 Stunden von Frankfurt nach Buenos Aires. Erstens hat das Fehlen von Kinderkopfhörern zusätzliche Unannehmlichkeiten während des Fluges verursacht, insbesondere für Eltern, die ihren Kindern Komfort bieten möchten. Darüber hinaus blieb das versprochene Geschenk der Fluggesellschaft nur ein Versprechen, was Enttäuschung sowohl bei uns als auch bei unseren Kindern auslöste. Zweitens war das Kinderessen weit entfernt von ideal. Nicht nur die Qualität ließ zu wünschen übrig, sondern auch die Auswahl war äußerst begrenzt. Dies führte zu zusätzlichen Schwierigkeiten für Eltern, die versuchten, den Geschmack ihrer kleinen Passagiere zu treffen. Insgesamt war meine Erfahrung mit dieser Fluggesellschaft alles andere als angenehm. Die unzureichende Aufmerksamkeit für Kinder und ihre Bedürfnisse hat den Eindruck vom Flug stark getrübt. Ich empfehle diese Fluggesellschaft nicht Familien mit Kindern, die eine angenehme Reise suchen."

The incoming flight from Germany, which was the first one at this day, was delayed by 30 minutes. Because of this i had to rush at FRA airport and only troubles with my lost bags. I try to avoid Lufthansa when ever it is possible and this as a Gold member of their terrible frequent flyer program."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,First Class,Amsterdam to Buenos Aires via Frankfurt,Apr-24,2,3,2,1,3,3,1,no,1,"  Our first ever First Class experience turned out a complete disaster. Our first leg from Amsterdam was cancelled while we were in the lounge. We had to leave and go back to the check-in counter to rebook the flight. Took us an hour at least waiting in the queue. Got rebooked for the next day with a layover of 9 hours in Frankfurt. The suitcase was said to be rebooked as well, so we went home without any luggage. The next day flew to Frankfurt, had to wait and wait. Initially we booked the first row seats in B747 First Class as it offered more privacy. By re-booking we were assigned to the 2 middle seats in the third row with no privacy at all! The service was good, and the food was ok. The cabin, entertainment system and seats were outdated and worn out. Arrived at Buenos Aires and got to hear that our luggage had not arrived. Needless to say, we felt miserable. Luckily for us the luggage arrived the day after. We are very positive people, and can understand that sometimes things can go wrong, but in this case we felt as if we were robbed. For the money we paid- to get such an experience. It’s truly beyond belief! Would never recommend this airline to anyone, nor shall we ever fly it again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Singapore via Frankfurt,Apr-24,3,3,2,2,,3,1,no,1,"  In a harrowing ordeal at Schiphol Airport, Lufthansa were left stranded without accommodation or proper assistance. The original flight on 15Apr was cancelled. We were rebooked several times over and the travellers were not informed of the changes. Worst we were booked separately. Shockingly, families and couples were inexplicably divided into separate flights. One minor (17years old) had to fly alone whilst his family (3) were on another flight. Throughout this ordeal, the group was stranded with no Lufthansa staff around to provide assistance and no contacts.  Amidst the chaos, desperate attempts to secure accommodation proved futile as nearby hotels were fully booked. With no alternatives, the stranded passengers resorted to spending the night on uncomfortable airport chairs. Next morning we went to Departure Checkin Counter. LH Staff on duty could not offer any explanation. LH could not offer us any room to washup and rest, but offered a meal voucher value €17. LH also gave us Business Class Lounge Voucher but unfortunately these vouchers were only valid for Munich or Frankfurt. We are in Amsterdam! Eventually, were rebooked on Turkish airlines. In the wake of this debacle, Lufthansa's handling of the situation has been met with outrage and condemnation. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to Munich,Apr-24,1,1,1,1,2,4,1,no,1,"  My second time flying Lufthansa. The first experience was not good but I decided to give the airline the benefit of the doubt, however my last flight reinforced my earlier experience. The plane felt old and overused. The Premium Economy section is a joke and not worth the additional expense. The seats were by far the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced and the fact that I was stuck in one for an overseas flight made matters all the worse. Additionally the flight crew was inattentive and the food and inflight entertainment low class."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Munich to London,Apr-24,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,3,"  This airline does not seem to be very good at getting people on and off the aeroplane. In both directions (London-Munich-London) the boarding started very late and proceeded very slowly. Given the high prices and low in-flight service levels I would have preferred a budget airline. At least budget airlines know how to get people on and off efficiently. Also, leaving Germany apparently one must complete a second passport check. This was not announced or explained by the airline, people were just expected to know they had to go to a separate counter to get a weird little sticker put on their passport. The reason was not given, and when I asked the Lufthansa staff member he got very defensive and shouted BREXIT at me - as though this very unusual process was completely explained by this single word. I have flown into and out of the EU regularly in the past few years and never experienced this. If Lufthansa is the flag carrier of Germany then I do not think I will choose to come here again."
Not Verified ,A340,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Chicago,Apr-24,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  05.04.2024, LH 430 from FRA to ORD, Business Class. The first thing that struck us upon entering the aircraft was how old it is. After an hour and a half, we were told we had to return to Frankfurt due to a defective engine. Various announcements from the crew attempted to reassure us and assure that someone would take care of our onward flights. In the last announcement, it was said that the app would solve everything, and we could manage our onward journey there. But as you know, the app doesn't work. Arrival in Frankfurt on the tarmac: We had to wait about 15 minutes for the bus to reach the terminal, then go through passport control back to the check-in area and for the first time, take a number and wait... After several discussions, I was ""lucky"" to be rebooked on a later flight. My question: Is this how a frequent flyer is treated? Are there no interim solutions in the transit area or in a lounge for Senator customers? The Flight: 05.04.2024, LH 432 from FRA to ORD, Business Class, Seat 3K. When I boarded, I thought the last plane was old, but this Airbus 340 was even older, over 26 years in service. This is also how one can describe the condition of the cabin, which I experienced firsthand at seat 3K. The seat was broken and could not be properly secured. A technician and the purser examined the seat and came to a common conclusion: ""The only thing to do is to saw it off."" Since the flight was full, I had no choice but to sit in such a seat for over 8 hours. My question: If safety is so important at Lufthansa and it is always checked whether one is fastened, then why are you allowed to fly in such a seat? Another question: Lufthansa sees itself as a ""climate and environmentally friendly"" airline, even offering CO2 compensation, and yet it flies around the world with such old planes?"

Overall the carrier has room to improve but is far better than any US carrier. A350 premium economy seat was comfortable, staff were pleasant and food was good for the eight hour trans Atlantic crossing. The leg from Munich to Berlin was rough, uncomfortable seating with next to no leg room. However cabin staff were also pleasant and attentive."

They outsource everything to a company called Dolfi that won’t even get my original value of my suitcase anywhere in the ballpark. And Lufthansa no longer has any person or email you can reach out to with customer complaints. All auto forms and outsourcing.

Moreover the advisor on the phone told me that I will receive a refund and he will mark my ticket for the refund. 3 Weeks later I have called the customer service and been told I need to submit an online form (which was in contradiction to what the first advisor told me). I have submitted an online form, still 2 weeks later no one bothered even to acknowledge that they are working on it, I have not received anything and more annoyingly there is absolutely no complaint process in Lufthansa, you can call CS they will literally tell you they only care about existing booking and you need to write an email which no one will ever reply. The online complaint is called ""feedback form"" and no one bothers replaying to this either. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Dubai ,Mar-24,3,5,3,3,,3,1,no,1,"  On the 18th March 2024 I was flying from Frankfurt to Dubai, flight LH630, which had to perform an Emergency Landing due to technical issue (smoke in the plane) around 6 pm in Rhodes. After a couple of Hours the pilot explained that the plane was not judged safe enough to finish the journey so we will wait 24 hours to get another plan. Finally we reached the destination with 25 hours delay (Tuesday 19th, at midnight rather than Monday 18th at 11 pm).  We had more then 3 hours delay at the arrival and it was a Technical Issue. I filled a form for a compensation, and the answer of Lufthansa is: ""The reason for the flight irregularity was Airfield restrictions. Unfortunately, we have no influence over circumstances, which are the responsibility of third parties. Such a flight irregularity does not warrant a claim for damages against Lufthansa."" Is it how an airline deals with their responsibilities by changing the real cause of the issue and putting the blame on someone else."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Munich,Mar-24,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  A horrible experience with Lufthansa. On March 16, 2024, I had a confirmed booking for a direct flight from Washington DC to Munich, which cost me a lot of money as I preferred a direct flight. However, upon arrival at the airport, I was informed that the flight was overbooked, and I was involuntarily rerouted onto an alternative flight through Frankfurt. When I arrived at the gate I was informed that this flight was also overbooked, and I was again rerouted onto an alternative flight through Vienna. As a result of those 2 involuntary rerouting, I arrived at my final destination, Munich, approximately three hours later than originally scheduled. This disruption to my travel plans caused inconvenience and discomfort, as well as additional expenses incurred during the extended travel time. In principle I have the rights provided to passengers under EU Regulation 261/2004, which outlines compensation entitlements in cases of flight delays, cancellations, and denied boarding. I contacted their customer service and their only reply is that my flight was delayed!"

They were completely uncooperative and seemed only interested in taking my money rather than helping me out.

Their rigid policies took precedence over customer welfare."
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Larnaca to Munich,Feb-24,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," I travelled with flight LH1769 from Larnaca to Munich on the 5th of February for a work training. The training was going to take place in Nurenburg. I was accompanied by my girlfriend in this flight. My flight ticket and bus was booked by the company sending me for the training. I booked my girlfriend's airplane ticket but didnt book the bus ticket at the time of the booking. Later I tried several times to book the Luthansa express bus for my girlfriend from Munich to Nurenburg online and via telephone with no success. Lufthansa employees (at Larnaca airport and from the call center) reassured me that I could buy her a ticket at the Muhich Airport. We took the LH1769 flight and then when we landed to Munich airport we could not buy a bus ticket as told. It is worth noting that the Lufthansa express bus had avalaible seats. However, they told us because we didn't book the bus ticket with the plane ticket that it was not possible for get to in the bus. At that point nobody informed me that if I didn't travel with the bus my return flight ticket was going to be cancelled. I informed my colleagues that I was not going to take the bus under the said circumstances. My colleagues forgot to notify the Lufthansa bus driver that I arrived in Munich but had to take a taxi after landing. I had to take a taxi to Nuremburg because my girlfriends health doesn't allow her to travel alone and besides she never used the train before or was safe to leave take a taxi alone (in Cyprus we don't have trains). The taxi that night cost 300 euros. My return flight ticket was cancelled and nobody inform me either by call or email because I didn't use the bus from Munich to Nuremburg on the 5th of feb. The return flight's date was on the 9th of February. My colleagues checking for that flight on the 8th of February and mentioned that my name was not on the list for check in. That's how I learned that my return flight ticket was cancelled. The company that booked my airplane tickets didn't notify me as well that my ticket was cancelled neither Lufthansa. I had to book tickets for another flight which I consider unfair as it cost 700 euros and I am complaining about not being informed of the cancellation of my return flight ticket and that my ticket was cancelled. My intention was to use the bus that night and buy a bus ticket for my girfriend, but the problem was that they didnt allow us to pay for her ticket. This is the reason why I didnt directly inform the bus driver that i would not use the bus on the 5th of February."

It used to be my favourite airline, had flown so many times in Europe as well as to the US. Decided to go to Buenos Aires via Frankfurt. Both flights were during the night. Never again.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Stockholm to Frankfurt,Mar-24,2,3,,,,2,1,no,1,"  Avoid it if possible. Every other week flights are cancelled because of strikes, lots of delays (as today), waiting 1 hour at the understaffed SENATOR hotline, outdated seating and a webpage where you never can rebook online.

On Thursday February 22 after dinner - about 36 hours before the flight I was informed the flight from Frankfurt to Newark was cancelled! No flight was offered. I contacted Lufthansa and another Frankfurt to Newark flight was arranged but no seat assignment could be made. The following morning this flight had disappeared from the Lufthansa app. Contacted Lufthansa again and arrangements appeared for an Egypt air flight Cairo to Newark but no seat assignment could be made and could not confirm - now within 18 hours of flying. This flight then disappeared from the app. Contacted Lufthansa again. This time the customer service person on the phone when she couldn’t find a way to get me home simply hung up on me! I was on a tour of Egypt and the tour director had connections at the airport and finally got me on a flight from Frankfurt to Philadelphia - fortunately I took a cab to Newark so I didn’t have to get to Newark to get my car, but I live much closer to Newark than to Philadelphia and the cab ride back was considerably more expensive."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Munich,Mar-24,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Lufthansa is the worst airline ever. Mediocre to horrible quality, unmotivated staff and always on strike.

If they let you on board the service is miserable with poor quality inflight entertainment.  I got an email of a seat change after paying for my seats. Luckily they told me at the gate the email went out by error? This is a company that is tired and dated and makes no effort to win over customers.  Uncomfortable tight seats. My seat didn’t even have a seat pocket even though you pay for the extra leg room. All in all horrid.
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,London to Berlin via Munich,Mar-24,4,3,,,,1,3,no,1,  Absolutely shocking experience. I was asked to put my hand luggage in hold despite having a short layover. The flight was of course late and my luggage didn't make it to the final destination. I had to wait at the airport for 4 hours for the next flight to bring my luggage. I was flying for work and this meant I missed my evening meetings as everything was in my luggage. They could've taken anyone's luggage who just flew to the connection airport and everything would've been fine. I booked a national carrier as I thought it would be a better experience but I have to say this was worse than any of my Ryanair or Wizzair flights have been. The guy was practically shouting at me as well. Never again.
✅ Trip Verified ,A319,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Lyon,Mar-24,3,1,1,,3,3,1,no,3,"  An uneventful Lufthansa European flight in economy. No service, except tiny bottle of water, and dull buy on board selection. We did not get on this flight the usual chocolate. Don’t know if it has been an exception because of some reason or if Lufthansa cancel  this “perk”. I cannot check this on my scheduled return, as flight is cancelled because of strikes."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Florence to Toronto via Frankfurt ,Jul-22,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,no,3,"  My husband, step-daughter and I flew Lufthansa Toronto - Rome. On our return flight out of Florence, through Germany, the Florence flight was delayed and we missed the Germany flight to Toronto. We had paid for a business flight however, when a flight is delayed and rebooked by the airline, they put you in your original class, which was economy. We incurred many costs staying in Germany over night including the 3 upgrade fees and to this date (from July 2022), we have not received proper communication about our reimbursement claim, not have we received a penny. Lufthansa customer service, if they respond, tell you to be patient. It's now almost been two years and i'm owed over $2,000. Any enjoyment in flight was ruined by their terrible customer service and standing behind their brand"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,"Bucharest to Osaka via Frankfurt, Tokyo",Feb-24,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,no,1," Delays, cancellations, cramped seats, overheated meals, terrible cabin crew and refusal to pay compensation. Worst airline possible! Avoid them at all costs! Missed my connection because they didn't bring the airplane on time at the gate. Told cabin crew on the flight about the issue and they deflected by saying they will contact me at arrival. They didn't. Had to talk to the other carrier and arrange another flight to my final destination. Lufthansa failed to help in any way. What is worse, they refused to offer compensation for the missed connection and late arrival at the final destination. On the return leg the flight was cancelled and I was notified just 1 day before the departure date. Their live chat system doesn't have any humans, only a bot that will give you a rebooking offer and that's it. Take it or leave it I used to love flying with them a decade ago, but now they've become worse than lost cost companies! I will never fly with them again for fear of ending up stranded in an airport next time."

The FRA-MAA connection (Dec 10 '23) was cancelled and Lufthansa booked me for another route FRA-DEL-VGA, on their partner carrier Air India (AI). Lufthansa assured me my baggage would be properly transferred to AI, despite route changes and on a different carrier. AI however would not let me board their aircraft until I paid an additional EUR 420 / USD 450, as Lufthansa did not have an baggage agreement with AI and they would not honor the baggage fees I paid Lufthansa. AI also refused to unload my bags since they were already in the cargo hold and asked me to submit a refund for the amount from Lufthansa. I have submitted multiple requests with Lufthansa, online and on the phone, but they refuse to refund the duplicate charges and / or acknowledge the issue. Lufthansa would not refund duplicate baggage fees their partner airline charged me, after Lufthansa booked me with them and to a different destination from the one I originally booked for."

How can a national carrier treat passengers like this will not be flying with them in a hurry and I am a member of Star Alliance. I do not know how I walked about all over the airport then train and hotel - so much for care of the disabled passenger. The outward flight from UK was good and I was well looked after.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,First Class,Birmingham to Singapore via Frankfurt,Feb-24,5,5,4,,5,5,5,yes,10,"  A very positive experience with my flight on Lufthansa. The Business Class flight from Birmingham to Frankfurt was fine. On arrival at Frankfurt I was met and escorted to the First Class lounge Terminal 1. The lounge was a perfect to place to spend a 5 hour layover. It was uncrowded with excellent service, food selection and drink. On my return to Frankfurt, I was escorted to the First Class Terminal which was of the same quality, as was the SIA First Lounge, which I used prior to my return flight. Also, I enjoyed the treat of Porsche rides to the aircraft. Onboard I was impressed with the high level of attentive service. It was a particular pleasure to be welcomed by the Chief Pursers on both flights - Natalie and Andrea. Andrea kindly spent about 10 minutes sorting out my phone to accept the free onboard WiFi. As both flights were late night departures I was mainly interested in sleeping rather than eating. But the food I did have was good and well presented and I enjoyed the cooked breakfasts of scrambled egg and smoked salmon cooked to order. My seat was very comfortable and I had a few hours sleep when it was converted to a cosy bed. I suppose the TV screen was a bit on the small size, but that was not a problem for me. So overall very pleasant flights with the superb lounges probably the stand out feature, but generally no complaints at all and I would be happy to fly again with Lufthansa First Class."

Accommodation and alternative flights have been arranged, however in a very chaotic way. The taxi from the hotel to the airport the day after is paid by me, as Lufthansa claimed that the expense is refundable. However, after 3 months super slow chat with the customer service at Lufthansa, they just informed they can refund 50 euros, which is only half of the taxi expense. They keep hanging up the phone when I try to reach them for complain and explanations."

Consequently, I purchased a new ticket to reach Brussels. Upon arrival, I discovered that my return flight had been canceled because I had missed the initial leg. Spending 1 hour and 30 minutes on the phone, attempting to communicate with a representative who bearely spoke English, was unable to offer assistance or show any empathy, proved to be a frustrating and sad experience. In the end, I had to purchase another ticket, incurring an additional expense of 300€."

Today again - strike in Frankfurt, again that can happen (even though the frequency that this happens with them compared to other airlines is peculiar) but the customer service representatives’ inability to provide any acceptable solution was striking. 3h 20minutes on a call, no solution given and no compensation offered.

Logically lost my connection flight to Sao Paulo. Captains of the flight served us with confusing explanations about why we couldn’t take off. At my arrival to Frankfurt no one was there to instruct us on where to stay for the night or when we could be booked on the next flight. Next morning i was rebooked on a flight that was cancelled. Now they don’t want to compensate me arguing that the issue was due to bad weather when there was not a singles drop of rain, snow or wind - complete bad faith and poor client service from the company that puts an email for customer service that doesn’t even work (an automatic response informs you that they don’t manage email anymore for security and privacy reasons.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sibiu to Lisbon,Jan-24,2,4,,,,1,2,no,1," I bought return ticket for my mother, on route SBZ-LIS-SBZ, from the Lufthansa web site. The return date was yesterday. However, while trying to do the check in, I was informed that the return of this ticket was cancelled online, on February, 2nd. I have absolutely not cancelled the ticket online, nor did I ever receive any communication from the company saying that the return was cancelled, so it must be a mistake from your end. It is true that the airport fees (€35) were returned to me on February, 3rd (without any notice), but as they went onto my credit card I only realized that yesterday. I called Lufthansa Internet Service Center in Lisbon. She informed me of the situation, told me there was nothing she could do except for selling me a new ticket, so she sent me to the Lisbon airport to the Lufthansa Help Desk. As I soon found out, there is no Lufthansa Help Desk at Lisbon airport, just a small counter to charge baggage excess fees. They told me to call the Lufthansa Call Center, who told me to call Lufthansa Internet Service Center, which, of course, was whom I called in the first place! I spoke with a lady who endlessly insisted that the return ticket was refunded to me (it was not! Only the airport taxes were!) and as such I had no more rights on my ticket whatsoever). This stunt has cost me some 400€, including the ticket that I lost and the new ticket I had to buy. However, what shocked me the most was not that Lufthansa has adopted (and refined) the worst commercial practices of the worst low-cost companies. What shocked me the most was that during all these endless contacts with the last men standing at Lufthansa’s contact centers, I could not find a single person willing to at least consider the possibility that this whole situation could have been caused by a glitch of their computer system. Welcome to the Brave New World at what was formerly known as Lufthansa!"

Old planes, the whole experience felt dated. Next time i will book on an A350 or some plane that is not 20+ years old.

The worst is the airline attitude towards its clients. It has been already 6 months I am trying to get compensation for the damaged luggage (even though the damage has been reported immediately on the arrival) and I am facing negligence from the airline customer care, who is forwarding my case to their partner Dolfi who is in charge of the case and sending the same copy-paste reply that they will contact me within a few days (which never happens). I am shocked with the way the airline deals with the claims and consider the attitude of the airline unacceptable."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Kraków via Frankfurt,Jan-24,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," The worst airline! Fly from Singapore to Frankfurt taking 13 hours. They feed us at the beginning and then nothing for 11 hours. Please take some sandwiches with you because you will be starving! They close themselves behind curtains and didn't care! In Frankfurt 13 hours delay. For all this time Lufthansa give me 15€ which you don't get without asking to spend at the airport which is equal to 2 sandwiches! No access to main bag where I had warmer clothes as was very cold. In my opinion, personnel of Lufthansa just don't care about you as clients. I spent on this ticket 1500$. They just ignore your needs! I fly from Sydney to Europe many times but nobody has made me feel how Lufthansa did! I do not recommend this airline. "

After the flight with my luggage arrived I received a text saying that it was at the airport available for collection. I drove to the airport and no one from the airline was there to give me my bag. I left and drove home. The next day I called their customer service and they assured me that someone would be there to give me my luggage so again I drove to the airport, again no one was there and I was forced to wait three hours for an employee of the airline to show up and give me my bag that had been there since the night before. Trying to find out when someone would be there was an abysmal experience and they did not specify any sort of time frame when I could collect my baggage which had been delivered the night before."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Colombo,Dec-23,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," I recently had an incredibly disheartening experience with Lufthansa, and I feel compelled to share my ordeal to warn fellow travelers about the serious issues I encountered. My journey with this airline was marked by delays, missed connections, baggage mishandling, and subpar service. Flight Delays and Missed Connecting Flight: My scheduled flight was plagued by repeated delays, causing a domino effect that ultimately led to missing my connecting flight. The lack of communication and transparency during these delays left passengers like myself feeling frustrated and stranded. The impact on my travel plans was significant, and the subsequent attempts to reorganize my itinerary were met with unhelpful and indifferent responses from the airline staff. Baggage Woes - Not Once, but Twice: To compound the already distressing situation, my checked suitcases were not loaded onto the flight not once, but twice. The first instance could be considered an unfortunate mistake, but the recurrence of this issue raises serious concerns about the airline's operational reliability. The inconvenience of arriving at my destination without essential belongings is simply unacceptable, and the lack of a proactive solution from the airline further exacerbated the problem. Subpar Service: Throughout the entire journey, the service provided by Lufthansa Airline was nothing short of disappointing. From unhelpful staff during delays to the apparent lack of a well-executed baggage handling system, it became evident that customer satisfaction was not a priority for this airline. The attitude of the staff members was indifferent, bordering on disrespectful, further adding to the negative experience. In conclusion, my experience with Lufthansa Airline was a complete letdown. The accumulation of flight delays, missed connections, baggage mishandling (repeatedly), and poor service has left me with a resolute decision never to use this airline again. I hope this review serves as a cautionary tale for those considering travel with Lufthansa. There are undoubtedly more reliable and customer-focused options available, and I strongly advise against choosing this airline for your travel needs."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Catania to Dusseldorf,Jul-23,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Our flight from Catania to Dusseldorf on 30.July (flight number: LH1909) was cancelled by Lufthansa (I received the cancellation Email). Then, we contacted them through online chat and their employee booked us with Eurowings airlines (as an alternative flight) for the same day (30.July), and he/she sent us the confirmation Email, which I kept it as an evidence. On 30.July, we went to Catania airport to get on the plane and we realized that our names are not in this flight list! Moreover, apparently, that flight had been deviated to Palermo but nobody had notified us. Anyway, we called their call center and after 5 times of try (because every time the call was interrupted due to an unknown reason!), finally one of their employees confirmed that ‘we can immediately book you in the Lufthansa flight on 10:10 AM on 30.July (from Catania to Frankfort and then Dusseldorf). We rushed to the counter, but at the counter we realized that our names were not in this flight list too Then, after 10 times of calling their center, finally their staff booked us the flight on 31.July from Catania to Dusseldorf. They even checked us in (I have the confirmation emails), but we received an Email saying that this flight got cancelled too. I had an online chat with their staff (named Jordan), but he did not assist me and even refused to book a flight sooner than 3.Aug for us with another airlines, though I told him that we cannot wait here more than this because both of us have to restart working from Monday! This was an exhausting process, and nobody answered us in the right way. At the end, we had to buy a flight ticket by ourselves from Palermo to Dusseldorf and came back home with lots of difficulties. We have spent extra money for staying in Sicily for one more night, travelling from Catania to Palermo, and also buying a new flight ticket from another airlines for our return. Lufthansa refused to refund us any of these expenses, neither compensated their cancelled flight,"
✅ Trip Verified ,A320/321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Warsaw,Jan-24,4,4,1,,,3,2,no,6," Well, to say that this particular flight from Frankfurt to Warsaw and back was a disaster would be an enormous exaggeration as I was punctually brought to my target destination, nevertheless I'm not fully satisfied with it. To be honest, it's quite unfair from Lufthansa's side to provide a service similar to a low-cost carrier but to set prices and to advertise themselves as a premium airline. As for now Lufthansa has learned all the ""tricks"" from the arsenal of an average LCC to limit the options for a passenger and hence to have a possibility to make everything payable, e.g. no included checked luggage (well, that's the only thing I support as many passengers don't need to have and to pay for this option), no free seat selection, a very limited meal service on board (a small bottle of water and one chocolate bar). They even managed to bring a calibrator to the gate and to measure the size of hand luggage and that looked really miserable. What made me especially angry is this ""boarding by groups"" which means if you randomly get a seat that belongs to ""group 5"" you will need to wait up to 40 mins in the queue. The announcements about which group is currently boarding are barely hearable so you have to keep your attention and to wait near the gate for quite a long time. Another unpleasant thing that should be avoided was that both times in Frankfurt the aircraft was positioned in the remote corners of the airfield so we had an ""exciting"" long trip to the plane in a cramped bus. I admit that there could be technical reasons for doing that, but it looks like more ""uh, it's just Warsaw, not Zurich or London, the public flying to this destination is not so demanding so we can provide a mediocre service and nobody will complain"". When I take a LCC flight I can fully accept all these issues because the low price justifies them, but it's not an excuse for Lufthansa. I have never taken the long-haul LH flights and I can believe that the situation is better there, but on European destinations I consider Lufthansa to be not fully competent and I tend not to choose it in the future."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to London City,Jan-24,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Flight delayed for 9 hours. Ground staff at Frankfurt airport were extremely rude and unreasonable. We prepared our cabin baggage basing on the required size and weight limits. But the ground staff told us we could not take our cabin baggage on board because the airplane was small. They scolded us, threaten us that they would not let us get on the plane, in front of our children. We sent a feedback to Lufthansa customer service team. Lufthansa did not responded mentioning anything about corrective actions, but ask us to fly with them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321neo,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Athens,Jan-24,4,4,4,,,4,3,yes,8,  I flew with Lufthansa yesterday night and the flight was really good. We departed on time and we were served a bottle of water and a chocolate. Also I bought a ridiculously expensive sandwich with salad and dessert which cost 12 euros. Seat was quite comfortable and it had plenty of legroom. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Dubai via Munich,Jan-24,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,no,1," Thanks to Lufthansa 2024 didn’t start particularly well. I’ve had a return trip from Dubai to Amsterdam via Munich with Lufthansa. That was my first time flying LH and I thought they used to have a good reputation. The trip began with the 3hrs delay from Dubai. After arriving to Munich there was no person to connect the bridge to the plane and let people disembark. Since I missed my connection I was rebooked on the last flight available that day. Again, the boarding was delayed because they couldn’t find a crew member. That part still leaves me speechless. Finally our flight departed with people sitting on their bags due to lack of storage compartments. That was more like a scene from a bus in the suburbs, rather than the safe environment up to aviation standards. On the way back from Amsterdam of course the flight was delayed as the inbound flight landed late. I also got to learn that the airline is saving costs on cutting the ground staff. There was 2 check in desks where *priority* passengers could get assistance. The remaining peasants checked in their luggage by themselves and pray for it to actually make it to the plane. After another couple of delays on both of my flights we got welcomed by the crew member who didn’t even bother to pretend like she was there to assist people. I did her job helping people around me to find space for their luggage, while she was standing there and yelling that we need to take it to the front. Her charming personality then continued glowing throughout the flight when she would keep knocking people’s heads with her elbows and pretending she didn’t notice. Kicking passengers personal belongings under the seats with her feet was also very welcoming. This wasn’t even the end of it. The cherry on the cake is that after finally arriving to Dubai I received an email stating that they lost my suitcase. Here’s where I also learn that there’s no customer support team or anyone to follow up with, as of course, that would mean paying people salaries. There’s no phone or email communication from Lufthansa. You do get a wonderful chat bot option which is basically talking to yourself. Now it’s been 2 days and they don’t even know in which country my suitcase is, and there’s no one to even do the job of trying to locate it. I’ve traveled a lot with different airlines in different parts of the globe. Starting from the largest in the world and finishing with the ones flying propeller planes in the third world countries. I’ve never experienced as much disorganization and indifference in my life. After this situation I went online and checked the feedback about their services and now I’m not surprised at all. Lufthansa used to be a flagship of European aviation. I don’t know if management is not able to control large operations, or they simply cut so much on staff that there’s no one to do the job. If you want to play Russian roulette then go for it and fly Lufthansa. For myself, I’d rather ride a camel from Dubai to Europe than ever step on their airplane again. Considering their efficiency it would take at much time to get to my destination with my belongings intact."

Boarding was began on time and we departed earlier wich is quite good. The seat was quite comfortable. My seat had plenty of legroom which is perfect for a 3H flight. In addition they only served us a bottle of water and a little chocolate. The service was ridiculous. I was expecting something more but the cabin crew was quite friendly. Finally we landed 15 mimutes earlier at Frankfurt which was good. Thanks for an average flight Lufthansa.

Lufthansa don't have PE. Check in was miserable in DUB. I was met with a dour, unsmiling and seriously unfriendly check in lady on the business desk, what a start for business passengers. Not a single word of greeting despite my usual smile and ""good morning"". Nothing except ""how many bags for check in,?"" That was it, no thank you no have a nice flight.  The flight was as expected. No issues. But please dump the small bottle of water and biscuit. Totally not needed!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Windhoek via Frankfurt,Aug-23,2,2,1,,,1,1,no,1,"   Christmas 2022 we booked flights from London Heathrow to Windhoek, via Frankfurt, thinking Lufthansa was a reliable airline. How wrong we were! Our whole experience, which is still ongoing, five months later, ruined our holiday of a lifetime. It started before we had even left home for the airport, when I tried to book inflight diabetic meals for my husband. This has never been an issue with other airlines but, although Lufthansa offers eleven choices of meals, these do not include a diabetic option. Even at the airport, their staff couldn’t find the option for us. The stewardess kindly put a note on my husband’s records, asking for the said meal on the return flight but this didn’t happen.  On landing at Windhoek, we found that one of our suitcases had not arrived.  We queued with others to report the missing case and completed the form derived by their QR code. I received an email confirming the loss and promising an update within 24 hours. I am still waiting for it. We now had to go into a city we didn’t know; find a shopping centre, we didn’t know, and then find shops to replace essential items, including my husband’s medication.  During our stay in Namibia, Lufthansa repeatedly changed our return flight times, the details of which were emailed to me and I had to confirm within a certain time frame. No allowance was made for the fact we were in a country with very poor Internet coverage. At times I couldn’t even get reception on my mobile phone. So, when we arrived back in Windhoek, to catch our flight home, I found their email cancelling our seats, as I had missed one of their emails.  On using Lufthansa’s webchat, to rebook our return flights, we were told our flights had been cancelled because of industrial action at London Heathrow. When trying to claim compensation, after our return home, we were told the flight was cancelled: because of bad weather in Windhoek and the plane couldn’t land and when I emailed them that we were already in Windhoek and the weather was fine, we were then told the weather was bad at the airport the plane was flying out of to get to Windhoek. Eventually we received compensation for the so called cancelled flights. Although we could claim for accommodation and meals, no allowance was made for three days lost pay; extra vehicle hire; extra fuel nor extra entry fees – all of which were occurred or forced on us."

And Munich airport terminal 2 is huge with no signs we were lost for almost half an hour. Acouple of more signs would be good but the airport is beautiful unlike terminal 1 in Munich.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Athens via Frankfurt,Dec-23,1,4,2,1,2,1,1,no,3,"   The crew was more than willing and kind to help us out through a lot of problems that we dealt in the flight from South Africa to Frankfurt. Firstly, the space between the seats is almost zero,let alone if the person sitting in front of you leans the seat backwards. I was unlucky enough to spend more than 1000€ for an economy seat, having to share my space with the person sitting next to me, because they weighted a few more kilos than a supermodel! After that, the headset wouldn't work, so I had to replace it with another one that also wouldn't work, so to realize that the base of the headset was broken, so I didn't have the chance of enjoying a movie or sth. The crew was kind enough to help me out, offering a headset from business class, but it also didn't work. As a gift, they offered me a voucher for wifi connection, however, the usb charger would not charge my phone enough. I tried to get some sleep,with no result of course, because the seat wouldn't come to a place where I could relax, The meals were about average. "
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Malaga via Frankfurt,Dec-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Lufthansa canceled my flight (purchased 2 months prior) the day before the flight because not enough tickets were sold. After hours on the phone with customer service, the “only thing they could do” was move me to a horrible alternative flight with multiple layovers which caused me to miss Christmas with family abroad. The money I originally spent on bags and seat selection was wasted. I was not even able to purchase a new seat for a 9 hour flight. Nothing was offered to improve their screwup - no credits, no upgrade, no refund! Pathetic and disgusting treatment of clients. They treat you like nothing but a dollar sign. Will never fly with Lufthansa again!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Frankfurt,Dec-23,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I booked a 2000 dollar flight, caught covid right before and was told they would refund with a doctors note. So I went to the doc, sent them the note just to have some customer service representative tell me no.  There is no way to escalate the process, no reference number for this, no way to contact any person who could resolve the conflict. The representative on the phone seemed annoyed by my audacity to call her and bother her and hung up on me. Nobody was even trying to find a resolution or even apologized.  I'm German living in the US and previously considered this to be a reputable airline but this lack of customer service is just mind-boggling. I will never fly with them again."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Denver,Dec-23,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,yes,10,"  I would like to commend the crew of the flight from Frankfurt to Denver. The Purser, Mr. Nicolas and his colleague Dangelo. They were, from the moment one stepped onboard the most accommodating, caring, friendliest, warm, and welcoming flight crew I have ever met.  Thank you all for making my travels fun, enjoyable, and safe."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Istanbul via Germany,Nov-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  My wife and I were due to fly to Istanbul on November 19, arrived at the check in counter, my wife had a small wrist cast. The woman behind the counter advised she would contact her supervisor, that she didn’t believe we were allowed to fly with a small cast. The very rude supervisor, gave us a New York phone number and told us we have one hour to get a medical certificate which would allow us to fly with Lufthansa. We called the number 46 times in the next hour and couldn’t get a response. I contacted other airlines in the Star Alliance, Turkish Air, Air Canada, Emirates, not one had issues flying with a wrist cast, Lufthansa was the only one. Ended up I had to cancel my tickets with Lufthansa as they would not allow us to board, they gave me only the tax back. I had to purchase new tickets to Istanbul for $1400. I complained to Lufthansa customer service and as usual their customer service was beyond useless. This is the second time I’ve used Lufthansa, and it will definitely be my last. The first time they lost all six bags from our group of six, going on a cruise for 14 days with no luggage. I wouldn’t rely on Lufthansa for anything."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Luxembourg to Mykonos via Zurich,Aug-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," A few days before the trip, Lufthansa made a change to the departure times. This messed-up my trip, so I called their Call Centre to find out what my options were. They advised I could cancel my entire trip, and they would refund me completely. Based on this advice, I agreed to cancel my trip. Guess what? I never received back the full refund they promised. They got my money, sold my seat to somebody else and never returned my money. Pretty ""smart"" way to make money, huh? Exchanging with their Customer Relations for the last 4 months has only increased my frustration. Take my warning and STAY FAR AWAY from Lufthansa. You should only choose Lufthansa if you are looking for trouble and frustration, because this is all they can deliver. I will probably never get my money back, but I can expose them to the public, so at least others do not fall prey to their practices."

Not Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Malta,Dec-23,5,5,4,,,5,4,yes,10,"  As always Lufthansa is reliable, punctual, spacious seat comfort for the short 2hrs 20 min flight. Cabin crew (and cockpit) more than polite and with a smile and joke, smile and you receive a smile back! Cannot understand all the complaints. Especially comfortable is the check-in via app with boarding cards on mobile phone. Very well done and easy to follow! Lufthansa of course among the top airlines."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Venice to Orlando via Frankfurt,Dec-23,1,2,2,2,,1,1,no,2,"  Monday morning 4 December flight from Venice with final destination Orlando, scheduled departure at 7.10 am. I have lived near Venice for more than 30 years, so cold and ice in December in that area are more than normal weather conditions. I got on the plane on time but the flight left an hour later because the wings had to be defrosted. Arrival in Frankfurt, waited for a bus from the runway to the terminal for more than half an hour. The plane from Frankfurt was supposed to leave at 1.30pm, delayed until 2.50pm. In the meantime it started snowing, nothing serious. Again, we got on the plane on time but due to the snow and having to wait for equipment to defrost the wings and clean the runway, we left at 6pm. 3.30 hours sitting on the plane, no support from the staff, not even a glass of water. We arrive in Orlando and no luggage had been loaded in Frankfurt! My two suitcases, half of which were wet, were delivered to me on Thursday. A nightmare. ​"
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Frankurt,Dec-23,3,1,,,,1,1,no,4, Worst airline in the world. Flight was delayed 4 times for no apparent reason. Caused us to miss our connecting flight home. Arrived in the airport and there was no customer service agents available. Called customer relations and was hung up on twice. Will never use this airline again.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Munich ,Dec-23,1,2,2,,,1,1,no,1,   Lufthansa has terrible customer service. I travel for business a ton and this is the worst customer service I have ever received. Their baggage policies are ridiculousp. The plane was uncomfortable. I will avoid Lufthansa like the plague moving forward.
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toulouse to Belgrade,Dec-23,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  First cancelled flights, then delayed flights that lead to staying in the hotel for the night, when we waited 1h to get into hotel because of the number of people also waiting, all operated by Lufthansa, such a bad experience"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Washington to Frankfurt,Dec-23,5,5,5,,1,1,1,no,1, Our flight got canceled 4 times and they lost our luggage twice. So now our two week vacation is not closer to 1 week and we have no clothes to wear thanks to Lufthansa’s incompetence.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Frankfurt,Aug-23,2,1,1,,,2,1,no,3,  I booked to fly with Singapore Airlines from Sydney to Frankfurt. The leg from Singapore to Frankfurt was operated by Lufthansa. To arrange preferred seating on this leg i had to contact Lufthansa direct and pay $60 Australian for each of the 2 seats on the ticket. My preferred seating was then seen on my pre flight schedule. At the airport in Sydney the seating was different to that ordered with them. The ground staff told me that this to do with Lufthansa. I was seated in different seats for the Lufthansa leg. Now the airline is doing its best to run me around and not give me a refund for the $120 I paid to them whilst they did not deliver the seating i paid for. The flight was terrible. My food was inedible Service was almost non existent. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ankara to San Francisco via Munich,Nov-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," I had a flight to San Francisco from Ankara via Munich,  due to heavy snow at Munich airport the flight is diverted to Izmir and after 4 hours there was another flight to Munich but the connecting flight to Munich was missed and the management don’t care about it. They made me wait for 48 hours at the airport until they arranged my ticket for the next flight. I can say that it’s my last time I will ever fly with this airline with very poor management and zero responsibility against their customers."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Tallinn to Prague via Frankfurt ,Nov-23,1,3,,1,1,2,1,no,1," Don't know the plane, but they changed the type of plane minutes before the flight. So 10 people may not have seats at all, and I had a leg space, but its canceled now."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Singapore to Malaga via Frankfurt,Oct-23,3,5,5,3,5,1,3,no,2,"  Flight from Malaga to Frankfurt was cancelled and there was chaos at the airport. There was no instructions or call to help with rebooking. Then the system couldn't be updated by the counter staff, and they told us to call Lufthansa ourselves (but no one was picking up). By the time we rebooked our own flight, our flight was delayed by two days. Trying to process the compensation request resulted in multiple emails back and forth, and when they sent over the compensation - they only paid for one person when we had confirmed that they would compensate for 2. For two months, there was no response when I tried to get an email from them citing the cancellation reason because it was needed by my travel insurance company. Calling them was no use either, because the person on the line did not understand my request and said they only handled reservations. During the flight, the seat mechanism broke - so the air stewardess had to adjust it manually by hand. Their service was attentive and excellent. We flew business class, but the treatment by the customer (dis)service has been terrible. I will avoid Lufthansa in future - cancellations and delays seem guaranteed, and while they charge premium prices, they behave like a budget airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,CRJ900,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Birmingham,Nov-23,3,1,1,,,3,1,no,5," I am flying a lot with Lufthansa and though I find their business class product pretty good (even if the seat on intercontinental flights is outdated), what is delivered in tourist class on European flights is simply a shame if not a true rip-off! One pays true premium prices and gets a low cost experience, except for a ridiculous small bottle of water and a chocolate. Buy on board experience is horrific, with little choice. Plus sales is done at incredibly slow pace. So, if yes I would in most cases recommend Lufthansa in Business Class, I must say their cabin experience in tourist class is below acceptable standards compared to what price you pay and this flight was no better at all!"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-800,Business,Business Class,Sao Paolo to Frankfurt,Nov-23,4,5,5,4,5,4,4,yes,8," Being in the upper deck of a 747 is always something special, even if Lufthansa’s business class seat is outdated. However comfortable seating and I had a solid six hours sleep on this 10 hours flight. Excellent crew in this flight, reasonable selection of drinks and good food."
✅ Trip Verified ,Neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Tbilisi,Nov-23,1,1,1,1,1,4,1,no,4," First impressions ""organised"" professional BUT not so on board. It is promoted as a 4 star airline but the experience is budget. You pay for meals even on 3 hour plus flights but pay premium fare price. You get a small bottle of water and a small chocolate. On board, no attention to carry on board limits so later passengers lose out and told can have luggage stowed in cargo BUT no checking for batteries, laptops etc in the process. No assistance to find luggage space in the overhead lockers by my attendant. Told to find it myself. When I suggested the carry on excesses were an airline issue he dismissed the complaint. Not his problem. Collectively it is.​ Seating tight spacing for a large build nation's peoples. Boarding sequence good window seat, then middle seat then aisle. Some staff friendly and try to make it pleasant. I watched staff transacting a drink with the cart blocking the aisle while holding up a passenger who clearly urgently wanted to access the toilet, the staff only had to move half a meter forward but spent time ensuring the passenger knew they were ""BUSY"" and would finish the transaction before moving. The priorities are wrong if transactions are prioritised over customer service. I think that sums up the current ethos. Avoiding flying them in future."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Fort Lauderdale,Nov-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,2," I purchased a ticket for my Mom to spend Thanksgiving together from Berlin to Fort Lauderdale, with 1 stop in Newark. My mom came to the airport 2 hours before the flight but was not allowed on the plane because United and Lufthansa did not confirm something between each other. So, my mom missed her flight due to bad communication between 2 airlines-partners. Still dealing with this issue to get a refund or change the ticket. That is not professional at all. Lufthansa can't even find confirmation now even I have all emails from them confirming the flight."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"New York to Frankfurt,",Oct-23,1,4,3,4,3,2,1,no,2,"  I was greatly disappointed. The staff was good but the comfort level afforded passengers was appalling. The seats were sized to tiny bottomed people, with no thought to full figured people who seemed to be the majority on my flight. The distance between rows is ridiculous. There is insufficient room. The passenger in from of me reclined her seat totally and there was literally about 7 inches away from my face. I could not watch the screen because of the closeness and I could not pull my table down to the proper level. The Flight Attendant had to force the women to put her seat upright so I could eat. It was back down as soon as we were done. Getting up and getting out of the seat to the bathroom was ridiculous. And there were no individual air conditioning vents to adjust the temperature. The cabin temperature had one point had to be in the high 70s at least. It was singularly the most uncomfortable flight I have taken in 50 years. Very, very disappointing and did not start my long looked for vacation very good. Honestly I expected more from Lufthansa!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A321neo,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Cairo to Frankfurt,Nov-23,1,2,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  The worst onboard service, the worst checkin, seat and worst boarding experience. The meal offered onboard was not matching the business class expectations. No champagne only sparkling wine and the cheapest one. My boarding passes did not work and the group staff did not print it again even though I have asked for. The online boarding passes did not work, I haven’t gotten any, it came always error message. The boarding was mess, not respecting the boarding sequence. Priority was not a thing for them. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Tokyo Haneda,Nov-23,3,1,2,3,,2,2,no,2,"  Most of the staff was rude to me. Staff smacked my arm a few times while I was speaking to my husband, in order to get my attention and she told me I had to pick the bread she didn’t bring me earlier with the cheese, I felt that an “excuse me” would have been enough to get my attention.  She then proceeded to give me a frozen appetizer. She made a mess of the food choices and when I said I didn’t want to eat breakfast she didn’t ask me for a drink, ended up ordering everything to my husband’s side which was a much nicer and professional flight attendant. The flight is 14hrs and unpleasant purposely picked business to be a little more comfortable but the food was terrible, and they only had 3 Japanese meal choices per cart for a plane with over 80 business seats. Won’t be flying again, the seat comfort wasn’t bad but I don’t like the heart layout if you’re traveling with a stranger. Also you need to jump over someone’s bed if you want to go to the bathroom and have a window seat. In Tokyo it took 1 hr to get our bags."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Toronto,Nov-23,3,2,3,3,1,1,1,no,1," Used to be a truly premium experience. Not anymore, boarding for a 1:15pm starts at 1pm, and only 1 out of 4 gates open, leading to boarding until 2pm. Crew just made a funny announcement that passengers are experiencing that they are delayed. In the aircraft all other airlines try to organize luggage in an efficient manner to get people to take the seat. Lufthansa just tells customers to find somewhere some space. For Ryanair this is perfectly fine, but not for an airline charging premium prices. Absolutely not understandable as other airlines - also western ones like UA, AA etc. manage such efficient operations and the German airline fails."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hamburg to Lisbon via Frankfurt,Nov-23,2,2,,,,3,1,no,1," It is very sad to experience Lufthansa getting worse with their service and lack - of solution solving skills every time.

Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Dublin to Kraków via Frankfurt,Oct-23,4,5,3,,5,4,4,yes,10,   Good service throughout. Meals could be a bit more substantial. Cabin crew extremely polite. Aircraft was on time with plenty of time for connecting flight. All aircraft were clean and tidy.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Madrid to Frankfurt,Oct-23,1,2,1,1,1,4,1,no,1,"  I am shocked how much their service has deteriorated lately. I could not imagine how little space there was between the seats in business class! I am only 1.70m tall and I had to seat with my legs apart as it was impossible to keep them straight! The seats were terribly hard and thin. The food was terrible- müsli without yogurt, and old and hard roll, the milk for coffee was missing. The staff tried to talk in German only, limited effort to use English or other language despite many interactions that should make them aware that I speak English. In Frankfurt Airport I used Terminal B where the conditions are horrible- a small place additionally with some works, no lounge, however it is a terminal for other airlines group and alliance members! There were only two small bars opened. They sell you business class ticket within and then you cannot take advantage of the business class services in their biggest hub in Germany! Incredible!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Budapest,Oct-23,2,4,,1,1,1,1,no,1,"   They do the farce of Priority boarding which means you are first to enter the bus and wait to be carried to an outside position  I am a lifetime-Senator and used to be a brand ambassador, but that’s history. "
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Munich to New York,Aug-23,3,5,4,3,,3,1,no,2," Wating for luggage took more than 1 hour in Munich. It is a problem there always. Supposedly no personnel - they probably pay less than social welfare! No wonder. After waiting more than 1 hour suitcase was damaged badly. I waited in line for complaint. They took my data and I was promised a new suitcase as mine was heavily damaged. It is now almost November and nothing. They outsource that problem to Poland, and I complained several times in writing but nothing. Just delaying it more and more and it will lead into Nirvana. I had paid business class and now this. Shame on you! Will I ever fly LH again? No, never!! Incredible, no customer service at all and just lies!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Riyadh,Oct-23,1,1,1,1,,1,1,no,1,"  I am a Lufthansa Frequent Flyer Silver and will get to Senator Gold level by the end of 2023. About 65 intercontinental legs and ticket purchases of probably approaching 45,000 Euros in 18 months, let me tell you how this rubbish airline has rewarded me, a frequent flyer. They delayed luggage on 3 out of the last 6 flights. Yes that's right.  Lufthansa has not enabled my business life, but have instead destroyed it. How am I supposed to go and buy a replacement suit for a client meeting the next morning, when my flight arrives late at night? As Lufthansa has used and abused me, so I will use them: as soon as I make it to Senator, I will have Star Alliance Gold, and will switch airlines. Lufthansa management should get out of their offices and fly their own airline, Economy class, eating that same cold horrible fatty cheese sandwich, that tiny hot dinner that is so small it leaves you hungry, along with that icy cold bread roll that is harder than a baseball, and having their luggage delayed so often. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Los Angeles,Oct-23,2,5,4,1,1,4,2,no,3," I have never flown Lufthansa and had no preconception other than I thought it was a good airline to fly. Our trip was probably our 7th international business class vacation flight experience. I’ll begin by saying the flight attendants were very good and attentive. The food was good enough to not be critical. I was very disappointed with the business class seating arrangements on the 350-900. It didn’t feel special. Way too close to each other and the entertainment centre offered a very poor selection of movies and other options. The little goody bag was useless other than the earplugs. No eye covers. The internet was so spotty the $35.00 I paid was worthless. Going forward, Lufthansa will be the last airline I would choose and of course I’ll pay attention to the plane being used. We were supposed to fly home on the A380 but that was changed before we left."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Belgrade via Munich,Jun-23,2,5,1,1,,1,1,no,1,"   Our transit 2nd flight was canceled, they knew in advance it will be canceled, 1st one was delayed nearly 3 hours. 5 hours waiting in Munich in customer service area, waited 1 and half hour, they all closed their desk. Told us to go at another terminal, they didn't care. From 9 am to 9pm journey to get hotel and another flight the following day. We were flying in Europe. They refused to refund us. Never with Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Rome to Munich,Oct-23,2,5,,,1,4,1,no,3,"   We booked a round trip business class trip from Los Angeles to Rome thru Munich and the return the same way. When we boarded in Rome for the return flight thru Munich we were on an A321 and were very disappointed in the business class experience. It consisted of coach seating with the middle seat empty. For what we paid, I would have chosen another airline. The flight attendants were very nice and accommodating. However, every passenger in the Business Class seating were grumbling with disappointment with what we got."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Washington,Oct-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"   This is by far the worst airline I’ve ever seen. Constant cancellations, extremely long wait times to speak with any representative and very rude representatives. I’ve been in customer service my whole life and I’m astonished the way they treat people. The people at the desk are laughing and talking amongst themselves while a line up of 50+ people wait because of constant delays. We were on our honeymoon and you guys completely ruined it. "
Not Verified ,Boeing 747,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Toronto ,Oct-23,1,3,2,2,2,1,1,no,1,"  Very disappointed in the service that Lufthansa gave us. We had a connecting flight from Venice to Frankfurt to pick up another flight from Frankfurt to Toronto because our flight was delayed. We missed our connecting flight. Went to Lufthansa customer service.to get rescheduled for a flight to Toronto had to stay overnight. In a hotel, the service representative promised us a upgraded seat because we missed our flight. She lied to me, had a regular economy seat. Very disappointed and how things turned out will never, ever fly Lufthansa again if possible worst airline ever."
Not Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Baku,Oct-23,3,5,5,2,1,5,5,yes,10,"  Before flight experience, I used Lufthansa's Business Lounge in B44, which was a great way to start my 5hrs segment to Baku. Food options are great, considering that one doesn't need to wait for food preparation, it will be refilled always. What I love about the food in the lounge is that they serve an indian dish such as Aloo Dum frequently and I really adore the taste! Also, the showers are cleaned well, very good facility to freshen up and they provide L'Occitane products in the lounge. Boarding from an Apron position and passengers had to wait inside the bus for about 10 mins, before pax could enter the aircraft. Aircraft seat was clean and the crew was fantastic, doing their jobs with dedicated and hard-working engagement to serve C pax well throughout the entire flights - with 12 rows in C on this flight. I felt really comfortable. Even though it was a 5hrs flight on a narrowbody A321 on that route, because of the service and the silence in the C cabin, I enjoyed my experience. I am not a fan of Tasting Heimat, but thats a matter of personal taste. Thus, I pre-ordered an Indian special meal ahead of the flight and it tasted great! Priority Luggage came among the very first luggage pieces on the carousel. Very happy with this. Con's: Wifi and lack of power outlets. However I read LH is working on equipping A320neo with those and bigger baggage compartments. Overall, I was really satisfied with choosing Lufthansa on this route and will do so again!"

✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Economy Class,Porto to Frankfurt,Oct-23,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,no,3," I did not think Lufthansa was a no frills airline, but almost imperceptible seat recline, no device charging on the plane, and tiny overhead bins with smaller carry on requirements than other carriers I fly. Service on the plane is one small bottle of water. Coffee, tea, anything else, is available for a charge. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Airbus 320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Rijeka via Munich,Sep-23,2,2,1,,,1,1,no,1,"   Frankfurt - Munich - Rijeka on Lufthansa, after a late arrival in Frankfurt from Zurich meant that I missed my connecting flight from Frankfurt to Rijeka. I was first told that I would have to fly the next day, which was completely false, as I showed customer service on my phone that I could connect through Munich later in the day. Crowded lounge in Frankfurt with lots of heavy German/Central European food, but not a single tasty thing to eat. My flight from Frankfurt to Munich was also very late, which meant that a second time that day I had to run to a departure gate not knowing if I would make the flight or not. I arrived in Rijeka seven hours late and didn't get my checked bag. None of the passengers who began their journey in Zurich that morning did, despite our six hour layover in Frankfurt which gave the airline ample time to retag luggage correctly. Every time passengers asked about our baggage being on the right flight we were brushed off. A useless airline with utterly incompetent customer service."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Baku,Oct-23,1,1,1,1,2,1,1,no,1,"  Already problems at the counter with checking in the baggage. Lufthansa installs new baggage processing equipment every 3-5 years for whatever reason. The new system scanned our boarding card and did not print the baggage ticket for us to be able to check in the luggage. Then we went to the counter to perform the same process manually. Guess what the new baggage processing machine got stuck this time and was not able to process the luggage. Had to wait 20 mins for someone to come and manually solve the problem.  Nevertheless, we thought that should be it we can fly and not worry about the luggage but it was too soon for us to calm down. We land at the destination and our luggage is not there. So, if you have problem with this new ""automatic"" baggage submission process which in turn results in manual problem solution and baggage delay till at least the next flight. Unnecessary and too much automatization of something that already worked well and no real solution when the new system fails and that is on top of a Ryanair like flight experience in a travel of nearly 5 hours with sandwich and no entertainment on board. I wont fly this airline despite living close to its home base - Frankfurt. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Frankfurt,Sep-23,5,5,4,,,5,4,yes,9,"   My wife and I flew Lufthansa from Berlin to Frankfurt to catch Thai Airways to Bangkok. Unfortunately, The flight was delayed many times due to bad weather in Frankfurt from 15 minute to 1 hour. We were quite worried because we were afraid that we were not able to transfer to Thai Airways flight back to Bangkok in time because the time was quite limited. With the help and kindness of two young female ground staffs of Lufthansa at Berlin airport, they arranged the procedure of luggage to check-through for Thai Airways flight at Frankfurt which we were very much grateful to their service. The flight LH 195 itself was quite OK, the cabin staff were nice and efficient. The seat was quite comfort. We were happy that we can transfer to Thai Airways flight without problem. Many thanks to Lufthansa ground staff at Berlin airport."
Not Verified ,A340,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Toronto via Newark,Oct-23,3,3,3,,,1,1,no,1,"  The flight from Frankfurt to Toronto was cancelled. The alternative flight was to Newark and then to Toronto. Due to long lines at the US custom, luggage pick up (un planned), we lost flight to Toronto. We were told at the Lufthansa counter in Newark airport that is our fault as we had 2 hours available to go through US custom, pick up luggage, do check in, go through security and we should have made it. After arguing, Lufthansa recognized that they cancelled our original flight and we end up getting our tickets re-booked for the morning flight but did not get hotel voucher. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico City to Munich,Aug-23,2,3,2,2,,1,1,no,2," Worst experience I've had with a commercial airline. During the month I was traveling I had various flights with Lufthansa and each one of them had problems with delays or cancelations. The specific flight I'm reviewing now had a two hour delay and my suitcase didn't arrive at a direct flight with no connections. It has been 6 weeks now and it hasn't arrived. It's also impossible to contact the airline for information and online there is the same message since day one. Something like: ""congratulations you luggage has been found and is on its way to you"". I called multiple times and was always forwarded to other people until the connection broke off. To my emails I only get generic answers asking me to go to their website and fill out the same forms I already filled out and even with two visits at different airports I was unable to speak with someone who can give me any information whatsoever. At the counter they don't know anything and the office in Munich was closed on a weekday during business hours. Same thing in Mexico. Every budget airline I have used had better costumer service than Lufthansa and this is only a review of in total 5 flights this summer, of which only one had no major problems. Now I have to file for the compensation for the lost suitcase and with the experience I had until now with Lufthansa I'm sure this process will be a nightmare too. Hopefully I will never have to fly with this airline again."
✅ Trip Verified ,A319,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Amsterdam,Sep-23,3,3,2,,1,1,1,no,1,"  My last experience with Lufthansa was atrocious, 3 delays because they had no one to fly the plane. 2 hours & 55 min delay, so not the end of the world. When I arrived, the whole wheel and frame of my 6 month old 170 euro suitcase was snapped off, no one in the airport wanted to hear about it. I put an online feedback request in for assistance & was told a luggage repair service would contact me with in 3 days. I have been dragging the bag around with one wheel for 2 weeks now, no follow up just a passive aggressive tone from the customer service rep. I understand the baggage handlers are contractors, but Lufthansa are practically ignoring my requests for assistance. The wifi did not work for the flight. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Business Class,Hanover to Munich,Oct-23,1,3,4,,1,3,2,no,3,"  Very limited space. Hard to work with notebook in the Business Class. WLAN not included in the Business Class tarif. No pillows, no blanket. Same bus to terminal, waiting till to latest passengers entered the bus."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,Sep-23,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,no,1," Worst airline ever. Never fly with Lufthansa. I almost miss my connection because my first flight got canceled. Then on the way back, they cancelled my flight, the customer service was horrible and then the rebooked flight was delayed at least 45 minutes. Never use this company."
Not Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Munich,Aug-23,5,5,5,5,,5,4,yes,9," Flew out of S.F. on Lufthansa premium economy and loved it. Extra leg room, silverware (Knife) which was weird, and orange juice as soon as you are seated - is this worth the extra 300 dollars a seat? Don't know but the leg room is great. I would do it again. Plus, our flight was suppose to leave at 2110hrs and exactly like German precision, 2110hrs we were backing up to the runway - same thing coming home from Munich. Suppose to leave at 4pm and pretty close 410pm we were on the runway taking off. I'd fly Lufthansa again. Oh, and food was pretty darn good. Pasta with cheese for dinner, and breakfast omelette for breakfast with coffee - not bad"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Belgrade to Miami,Jun-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Can't believe Lufthansa canceled my return flight and refuses to give me a refund! Left stranded without a ticket to get back home, and now I have to shell out more cash for a new one. Talk about poor customer service! My initial roundtrip flight was booked a few months ago: Flight details: Belgrade to Frankfurt to Miami (coming into Miami) (round-trip) Total Cost: $764.60. Flight into Miami - there was an issue with the plane tyre and after spending hours stranded they decided to have us go on another flight to be able to get into Miami. After spending hours on the phone in the past few days with different representatives and being extremely frustrated, I was told to book another new ticket and pay again for it because my initial ticket was canceled."
Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Bengaluru to Toronto via Frankfurt,Sep-23,4,4,2,2,1,1,2,no,2,  We upgraded our ticket from premium to business and immediately logged back into Lufthansa to check and it clearly showed that 32 kgs x 2 is allowed baggage but we’re harassed at the airport and had to pay for additional weight. No access to lounge in Frankfurt and rude staff and information not provided during or after the upgrade. Worst airline and not flying again.
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Orlando,Sep-23,2,1,1,2,1,3,1,no,2,"  Voluntarily, I will never choose this airline again. Here are the reasons why: - one meal on a 10.30 hours long flight - you need to pay for everything, exceptions is water and coca cola - extremely poor service and by that I mean, stewardesses gave us a glass of water like 5 times during such a long flight - no buttons nor possibility to call steward during whole flight - extreme cold, they were just crazy with air-conditioning and of course there is no ventilation which you can adjust - bought internet onboard so I can work, steward told me that there is no internet at all - why offer it on website if you don’t have this options? I wanted to upgrade my class, there is no possibility to do that neither get proper information about possibilities to do upgrade."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Munchen,Sep-23,3,5,2,1,2,5,3,no,6, This is my third Lufthansa flight within 3 weeks. All 3 flights were delayed. The seats don’t have chargers for your electronics. A plastic water bottle is passed to each passenger whether they ask for one or not. (It is equally disappointing that 95% of the passengers take one). The crew was very friendly.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8 ,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to San Francisco,Sep-23,4,4,4,1,2,4,4,yes,6,"  I like Lufthansa. They are a little cheaper than United on the same route and most of the time they are on time. The food and service is mechanical but efficient. I was excited to get a first look at Boeing 747-8 and thought seating on the double Decker would be fun! Alas! Who knew seating 'higher up' does not mean elevated experience. The business class seats at the upper deck are similar to down below, except it's 2-2 instead of 2-2-2 due to narrower space. The design of this business class (including lower deck) works for a couple but for people flying in business, does not make much sense. There are ample of holes if you are seating on the window seats but none for the passenger seating in the aisle seats. The seat was ok, it reclined fully and did it's job. I may have gotten a few hours sleep. The worst part was the screen and video. The touch screen barely worked. The remote was slow but did work, however, the screen resolution is worst than older box TV. The noise canceling headphone did cancel noise but every time there was turbulence, it made weird sound. Overall a good experience but could be improved. I like Polaris seating arrangement better. However, the wine and beer selection in Lufthansa is a tad better. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Manchester,Jul-22,1,3,3,4,,1,2,no,2,  Our 22.15 connecting flight from Frankfurt to Manchester in July 2022 was cancelled and there was no customer support provided. Everything closed and hundreds of stranded passengers sleeping on the airport floor. Lufthansa couldn't get us on a flight the next day so put us in a hotel miles from the airport (they paid the taxi). Finally got to Manchester 44 hours late. Very poor customer service and a terrible experience. After 11 months Lufthansa finally paid 600 euros compensation plus 70 euros for delayed baggage.
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Helsinki,Aug-23,5,5,2,2,2,3,3,yes,7,"  Frankfurt – Helsinki return in Economy. Our journey started stressful with a bad self check-in in Frankfurt. First we didn’t get our boarding passes at the check-in kiosk, so we had to do this procedure again. And again typing e-mail addresses and more information. Then we had trouble with the baggage drop off. Finally we used the check in counter with Lufthansa staff and it worked. The flight itself was good with a nice crew and on-time arrival. The return flight was smooth: check-in in Helsinki was fast and easy, staff was helpful. Onboard experience was fine: again a nice crew and punctual arrival in Frankfurt. Economy seats in Lufthansa’s A320 are comfortable, but there were no power outlets and no IFE screens. Wi-Fi worked so-so. And you have to pay for everything except water."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Bangalore,Sep-23,2,2,3,2,2,4,3,no,5," Interior design looks poor and from another generation. In business class, if you sit in the last seats, there is high probability to not get the meal you want. Crew is friendly but you really feel that this is a show or fake. Entertainment system is one of the most poor user friendly systems, the content is ok. But the remote control is not good, the screen luminosity is poor and the the browsing of films is made only for people with good eyes. Screen font are so small. Pictures of the films are so tiny, that I gave up watching a movie and went to sleep. The seats are on, but when 180 flat, it is very narrow for the legs. No mattress offer."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Munich,Sep-23,1,3,4,1,3,4,2,no,1,"  My experience with economy class seating comfort on the recent flight has been completely appalling. I have submitted my feedback to Lufthansa, and for this I have received a copy-pasted template response that have denied my request to compensation when I have not made or implied this request any at any point. Lufthansa made it clear that the comfort experience was as-intended by the company. The crux of the issue was lack of upper body ergonomics in the seats - while there was decent legroom provided, there was no way to rest my upper body without disturbing the passengers next to me, no matter how I tried to contort and what sitting poses I would pick. At its root, there is just not enough space between you and the forward seat ahead when it is reclined (which it will be on a long transatlantic flight!), the arm rests were useless, the angles between your body and seats/walls were uncomfortable, and the seating surface was just a bit too short.  Additionally, the in-flight entertainment gets a low rating due to brightness issue compounded by lack of space - if the IFE screen is off, any time you try to move in your seat you will bump against it... at which point the screen comes back on at default brightness. This means it'll shine bright in your face and disturb people around you many-many times over on a dark flight. The default brightness is extremely bright for a dark flight condition when everyone is trying to sleep, and there seemed to be no way to make the IFE remember the brightness level. I did not use IFE for its intended entertainment purpose, so I cannot rate the media contents. The second short flight using A321neo was just OK. It provided the basic level of comfort, but was nothing to write home about. The other aspects of my flight were not notable in the context of just how very uncomfortable the seating was."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Katowice to Frankfurt,Sep-23,3,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I had an unpleasant experience while on board a Lufthansa flight from KTW to San Francisco via Frankfurt. On my flight to Frankfurt, first I witnessed a flight attendant loudly screaming at another employee before boarding.  Once on the plane, the same flight attendant yelled at passengers to not bring their bags on board, instead insisting they leave their carry-ons at the foot of the airstairs. I understand the issue, but I didn’t know how it all works, and I was connecting in Frankfurt, I politely asked the FA, if I could please keep my only one bag pack with me since my connection was tight. She raised her voice and yelled that everyone here has a connection and walked off. Very rude and unprofessional. My arrival gate was in the B concourse and my connection was in Z. It would have been very difficult to wait for my bag with such a long distance to travel within Frankfurt Airport. Fortunately, another passenger told me we could get our bags while leaving the plane, before boarding the terminal bus. It's a shame it took a fellow passenger to explain things to me and deal with my concerns. The FA on the other hand, was rude, unprofessional, and from my point of view, on a power trip. I told her this as I was disembarking the aircraft and felt worried, she would have removed me from the flight had I asked more questions. Customer service is something that she is definitely lacking. Instead of dealing with a legitimate passenger concern, she pulled a power trip on me without any explanation directing people is not acceptable. Only one sentence was needed from her, that “we can pick up our baggage right after leaving the plane, before we will get on the bus”, instead yelling and screaming on passengers. Please consider retraining your staff to better handle your passengers' questions."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Munich,Sep-23,3,4,1,,,2,2,no,1,"  I fly for over 25 years with Lufthansa, but service levels continually decrease while prices increase. Today nearly 2 hrs delay and they could have send another plane. I was a brand ambassador in the past, 9 years HON and lifetime Senator, but if I have a reasonable alternative, I choose this now."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to Bangkok via Munich,May-23,1,1,1,1,,1,1,no,1,"  The rudest staff imaginable, dirty toilets, the food was absolutely disgraceful. I woke to the smell of food, asked the stewardess what the choice of food there is, she said there is no choice. Vegetarian, terrible bland pasta in a sauce.  I asked for an extra piece of bread answering bluntly no. Terrible entertainment, nothing newish just old outdated material."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to Beirut via Frankfurt,Sep-23,1,2,2,1,5,2,1,no,3," Last time I travelled was in 2020, I understand prices went up but!! I paid 2000$ and it was the worst flight I’ve ever been on, even the service was less than mediocre. I’ll start with the delays: all of my 4 flights were delayed by 1h30min to 2h because of some lame excuse: plane not here yet, another plane blocking us, cleaning the aircraft. I was exhausted before starting my 7h flight and they overbooked, so they started asking passengers to give up their seats and take another flight with a different airline (of course paid and everything but still). Now Cabin Staff service: I am short, therefore I cannot reach the cubbies on top to put my luggage and that’s why I didn’t have a carry on since I was traveling alone. They made me put my small purse in the cubbie which is fine for safety reasons. When I was allowed to take it back, I got up to reach it, but I couldn’t. Everyone looked at me while I was jumping trying to open it and when I asked for help, the hostess rudely said: “I’m not tall either” and told me to wait. I sat down and waited for an hour, no one showed up to help. My anxiety was getting worse, I needed to disinfect my table and screen before they served food and beverages. I awkwardly asked the guy next to me to help me get my purse and I’m thankful for him. Now entertainment: There was nothing interesting to watch. Thank God they had wifi so I paid for it and watched on my phone the entire flight. Food: It was ok. I’m not that picky. Long story short, I don’t recommend Lufthansa for long flights, maybe a flight up to 3h maximum. They are not well organized, it vey poorly managed, everything was chaotic and uncomfortable. Not worth the money I paid, and I was frustrated from the delays alone before stepping into the aircraft. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-800,Business,Business Class,Buenos Aires to Frankfurt,Sep-23,3,5,4,3,4,4,4,yes,7," As much as I hate Lufthansa’s European product, their intercontinental Business Class is quite ok and was on this flight very good. The seats and entertainment system are really outdated but service made it really up this time. Decent variety of drinks with pro-active refills, good food and lovely crew. On this 13-hour flight I was also able sleeping a solid seven hours."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Salzburg via Frankfurt,Sep-23,3,3,1,1,3,1,1,no,2, Took a flight from Brussels to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to Salzburg to attend a wedding. Luggage hasn’t arrived and the reason is “they didn’t have time to move all the bags to the plane”. The most nonsensical excuse. They could move some but not all luggage?! I have medication that I require daily and am supposed to attend a wedding. Absolute disaster and expect better from an expensive airline.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-400,Business,Business Class,Vancouver to Istanbul via Frabkfurt,Aug-23,2,3,1,2,2,2,1,no,2,"  On August 23, 2023, I flew to IST business class via Frankfurt by Lufthansa under the Air Canada Ticket. The aircraft was very old, outdated, and dirty, which I never expected from LH. I did not pay for this class of service. Food quality is much lower than any airline. I asked for a mattress cover and was told it was not loaded for this flight. I had to sleep in a bare seat, and it was very uncomfortable. A hot omelette breakfast was served cold, so I returned and had no time for further services. Again, the food quality did not match LH, which I had flown since childhood. Frankfurt to Istanbul, people boarded airplane like cattle regardless of booking class with very rude, not attentive two agents. I complained, but unfortunately, LH customer service is probably using Indian call centers, and it is impossible to reach someone."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Tehran via Frankfurt,Aug-23,2,2,3,3,2,2,1,no,1," I decided to fly Lufthansa for the first time in 25 years, and they managed to lose both of my bags. It is impossible to get an answer from them about anything. Your calls will be directed to a call center in Philippines and every single time you will hear a different response. The most painful part is that Lufthansa sent an email in the morning of the flight to check our carry on for free, which means they lost my carry on for me for free."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Seoul,Sep-23,2,3,2,1,3,2,1,no,2,"  Old plane with middle seat in business class. My infotainment didn't work at all. Crew is the only decent characteristic. They offered apologies. Food okayish With the same money you can fly Qatar or Emirates, so never again Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320-Neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Frankfurt,Sep-23,3,3,1,,,3,4,yes,7,"  I have given a decent score despite landing in Frankfurt 5 hours later than intended, because the airline reacted quickly to circumstances beyond its control (poor weather) by rebooking me immediately on to an alternative Lufthansa flight of my choosing. I was originally booked to fly from London City Airport to Frankfurt on the mid-morning flight but the inbound aircraft could not land due to dense fog at that time and the aircraft was eventually diverted to Gatwick after several go-arounds, so my flight as cancelled at the very last minute (when all passengers were waiting at the gate to board). There appeared to be only 2 Lufthansa ground staff at London City airport managing this flight and the senior member was unfriendly (she was borderline rude to some passengers who were understandably worried about delays leading to missed connections in Frankfurt) but her colleague was much more sympathetic. I bypassed them both in the end by reaching out to Lufthansa using their web chat on my phone internet whilst still at the airport gate, and was rebooked on to a later flight from London Heathrow airport, though the web agent had to wait for the Lufthansa computer system to “officially” recognise that my original flight had indeed been cancelled (which took a few minutes). I was then rebooked and checked-in automatically and my new boarding pass emailed to me immediately. I appreciated that I had automatically been allocated an aisle seat on my new flight, as I had paid for an aisle seat for my original flight. So basically the web chat agent had been very helpful. After that I was reliant on the Lufthansa ground staff to walk us (all affected passengers) back to “land-side” from “airside” of the airport. Luckily I did not have check-in luggage to wait to collect, so I immediately travelled across London (at my own expense) using public transport from City airport to Heathrow airport for the early afternoon flight to Frankfurt. This was a totally full flight due to accommodating others who had missed the City flight like me. Boarding for this flight was by zones, and I saw some people’s cabin luggage (those with carry-on cases) being weighed at the gate itself to check for compliance with the 8kg limit. This flight took off half an hour late (not unusual for any Heathrow flight, of any airline). We received one small bottle of water and chocolates for free. Anything else to eat/drink had to be purchased (card only accepted; not cash). Service was pleasant enough. In the end I was just happy to have made it to Frankfurt, albeit 5 hours later than planned."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Tunis to Berlin via Frankfurt,Aug-23,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," Buckle up, folks, because I've got a story that perfectly sums up why Lufthansa should be your last choice in flying. If you enjoy stress, frustration, and zero accountability, then, by all means, book your tickets with them. If not, run in the opposite direction! Let's start with the baggage debacle. Yes, Lufthansa lost not one, not two, but FOUR of my bags! They're trying to prove they're the masters of mishandling luggage. And the cherry on top? Their communication was a joke. I felt like I was playing a guessing game with my own belongings. But the real kicker? When I reached out for compensation, they dared to respond with, ""According to our record, the baggage irregularity happened at your home airport. Please understand that we cannot comply with your compensation request under these circumstances."" Seriously? So not only did they lose my bags, but they also refused to take responsibility for their mistake! Now, let's talk about customer service. If you've ever wondered what it's like to deal with unhelpful, indifferent, and unresponsive staff, Lufthansa has you covered. They've taken a crash course in making customers feel like a burden. Oh, and the fun doesn't stop there. Last year, I had the ""pleasure"" of going through the same ordeal with Lufthansa's baggage mishandling. You'd think they'd have learned from their mistakes, but nope, they're consistent in their incompetence. So, if you're into mind-numbing frustration, long waits for your lost bags, and dealing with staff who seem to need to learn what's going on, Lufthansa is the perfect choice for you. But if you value your sanity, time, and belongings, do yourself a favor and steer clear of this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Bahrain,Aug-23,3,2,1,,,1,2,no,1," Delayed baggage on 2 out of the last 3 flights. Both flights were business trips. I am a Lufthansa Frequent Traveller (silver card), and would have achieved Senator status before the end of 2023. This airline has caused me to have to: (1) Attend a C-Suite meeting in jeans and a casual shirt in Riyadh about 2 months ago (2) Caused me to have to conduct a seminar today in Bahrain, in short pants and a casual shirt AGAIN, today, 1 Sept. Two mess-ups on 2 consecutive business trips. My professional credibility eroded, because Lufthansa cannot get my baggage to my flight destination, and I have arrived too late in the evenings to go and buy replacement clothes. I still have another 12 intercontinental sectors to fly this year, and I'm not going to give them to Lufthansa. I'll be returning their Frequent Traveller card, and will stop using them before they completely destroy my professional credibility. They can't even get the basics right, and their Lost Baggage SMS's that read ""Exciting news! We have located your..."" are neither going to get me ""excited"" nor prompt me to give them another chance to potentially lose my baggage a 3rd time. Auf wiedersehen. I don't need your hassle."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Florence,Aug-23,2,5,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I am studying abroad for one semester in Florence. I flew Lufthansa (operated by Air Dolomiti) august 29 Munich to Florence. Unfortunately, I have a broken foot and am wearing a boot. My luggage was lost in Munich. I have an air tag in my suitcase. I have tried many times to contact Lufthansa and Air Dolomiti and they have told me I have to wait 21 days before I can be reimbursed for the lost luggage. My apartment does not have wifi so I am struggling to navigate to a café with wifi to make contact with the airline. No one answers the phones or answers my emails."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Tibilisi via Munich,Aug-23,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,  The flight departed LHR at least 4 hours late leaving no time for the connection. It turned out the flight from Munich to Tbilisi was also delayed 2 hours. This airline was totally indifferent to helping stranded passengers as were any member of staff at Munich. Terms like arrogance and callous indifference by the airline and the airport are relevant. No provision late at night to deal with the airlines problems. My bag has still not turned up after 5 days and not a single apology and plenty of ‘we don’t know we don’t care’. No offer of compensation so now I have to fight for it. 
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,Aug-23,3,2,2,2,2,1,2,no,5, Really bad customer service. No chat available with a person. People working for the airline very disrespectful and inefficient. Also issues with long waiting lines and with online check-in. Maybe will avoid in future
✅ Trip Verified ,A340,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Chicago,Aug-23,2,5,4,3,,4,3,yes,8," Very empty late afternoon flight to Chicago and therefore lots of good interaction with the cabin crew who really were outstanding. The seat is outdated, since years already, as well as the entertainment system. On the other hand, food and quality of wines offered was quite reasonable. Tried this time the new system on the internet for advanced booking of the main course, which gives more choices than what on the onboard printed menu is. Basically a win-win, as the airline can save on meals and avoid throwing away “left-overs”. But don’t think one gets rewarded with something that extensive (and luxurious) as some Asian airlines offer: it is miles away from such thing. Also the booking process through their website is quite complicated (or hidden), so when I got my pre-ordered main course I was surprised it even worked. Maybe it is a brand new concept and Lufthansa still is trying out how to position itself with this new service, but I hope they will further develop it."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Munich,Aug-23,3,3,,,,2,2,no,1," Lufthansa delayed our luggage - baby’s travel cot and car seat that could only be delivered in Munich or collected at the airport the next day. So we had to wait in the airport for hours doing paperwork, delay our trip to Austria and stay in Munich for the collection, change train tickets, lose a night’s accommodations in the process, and of course all of this with a baby. We asked them to compensate for these which they denied. Looking at the other reviews, I am actually grateful they didn’t lose our luggage! And the time and effort spent on chasing a compensation is frankly not worth the money. The incompetence is ludicrous and their customer service is disrespectful. Lesson learnt: never to fly to them again!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Larnaca via Frankfurt,Aug-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1, By far the worst airline I have ever flown with. I had 4 flights with them (in the course of 2 weeks) and every single one was delayed. When contacting customer service they just sent generic emails not even reading my complaint. The onboard experience was also quite unpleasant and the service extremely unprofessional. Truly shocking.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Couple Leisure,First Class,Frankfurt to Houston,Aug-23,1,1,1,1,,1,1,no,1,  Boarding was chaotic. The cabin was dirty and outdated and my seat was uncomfortable and in a poor state of repair. My food was very average. The service was distant. The airline managed to lose my luggage and the after care has been beyond your worse nightmare - 4 days later and no one can help. Help lines / emails are not answered and after contacting Lufthansa First help I had the phone put down on me. 
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangalore to St Louis via Frankfurt,Aug-23,2,3,4,3,2,2,2,no,2,"  We understand that experiencing delayed baggage can be frustrating, and it seems like the handling of the situation by Lufthansa in Saint Louis has been quite challenging. Initially, it appeared that the baggage would be available for pickup at the airport by 6:30 pm on the third day. However, when arriving at the airport, there were no open Lufthansa counters or assistance available. After contacting customer service, it was discovered that a courier had picked up the baggage, but there was no delivery address on file. Once the address was updated, the Lufthansa website indicated an unusual delivery time of 12:30 am. Upon calling customer service again on the fourth day, it was revealed that airport personnel, not the courier, would handle the baggage delivery and would call to provide a status update. Unfortunately, as Lufthansa operates in Saint Louis only on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays, it seems that contact from airport personnel might not occur until the 6th or 7th day."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Tokyo,Jun-23,1,1,,1,,1,1,no,1,"  My entertainment screen did not work and I was offered a 300euro voucher against future flights which at the time i thought was fair. Little did I know when I tried to use it that it was in reality worthless. When booking from the UK prices are quoted in £ sterling and according to the airline they cannot credit the Euro voucher. I have had many exchanges with the airline who say it cannot be credited and re-issued in £ sterling. Was I told about it at the time it was offered, of course not. The airline are totally inflexible. My comments below are limited to this issue and not generally."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Hong Kong,Jan-23,3,1,2,1,1,1,2,no,3,  No customer service at all. Our flight got cancelled last minute which caused us a 24h delay.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Wroclaw via Frankfurt,Aug-23,4,4,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Still not arrived at destination in Poland on a 5 hour flight from London, 55 hours and 2 hotels later. Nothing but misinformation, incompetence, overbooked flights, breaking EU rules for customer care and misplacing luggage. We are extremely well travelled and this is our worst ever flying experience. We will never ever travel with Lufthansa again. Still not at destination. Have now give up and changed to another airline. Tried to notify Lufthansa that we were not using the final flights but their chat assistant wasn't working. No surprise there!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Krakow to Munich via Berlin,Aug-23,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,  Due to delayed flight Krakow to Berlin with a transfer in Munich my luggage got lost. First of all there was not enough LH personnel available in Berlin resulting in a waiting line for 3 hours at lost luggage desk. I did all the necessary steps to try to get my luggage back. Contacted the lost luggage desk from LH - filed a lost luggage report - called at least 15 times to LH - filed a content list of my lost luggage. However Lufthansa personnel just does not help me in trying to even locate my luggage. I am very unsatisfied with the service of Lufthansa and therefore I recommend nobody to ever fly with LH again.

Their flight crew are kind and helpful and they give out free water bottles and chocolates to make you comfortable! I had my baggage delayed for one day after flying with a connection stop and they delivered the baggage to my hotel afterwards.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Munich to Zurich,Aug-23,1,,,,,1,1,no,1,  Been flying for over 30 years and this is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. They had no gate agents until 2 minutes before our flight and then proceeded to have us go down the gate where we have been stuck in a stairwell for 30 minutes in the heat and no updates. We are supposedly waiting on a bus but no one will tell us anything nor allow us to go back. This needs to be reported and someone needs to be responsible for such horrid service. 
✅ Trip Verified ,A321neo,Business,Economy Class,Venice to Tbilisi via Munich,Aug-23,1,2,1,,,3,1,no,4,"  I bought at the last minute an overpriced Lufthansa ticket. Last time I flew with them was in 2018 I think, and at that time I had a ""just ok"" flight to Beijing, with a very very old a340. Nothing to say of this time except that what you get from this overpriced company is worse experience compared to Ryanair. No service at all.  I'm 1.8m tall and I don't know how it is even legal to have so tiny space between seats.  Also, one thing that made me crazy was the boarding procedure. First route to Munich was an Embraer 195, they divided in 6 groups from front to back. Half an hour to board in this way. Same on the second flight. In Munich Airport we waited several minutes inside the tunnel, without air conditioning and extreme outside temperatures. "
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Singapore,Aug-23,2,4,1,2,2,1,1,no,1,"  A very disappointing experience. Staff was friendly but food below average. After 10 hrs flight got a sandwich for breakfast which was dry and not eat able, a muesli bar and yoghurt. Staff felt embarrassed to serve such terrible breakfast and advised to complain. Will not fly with Lufthansa again. Unfortunately being part of an alliance had no choice. Budget airline service."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Orlando,Aug-23,3,3,3,2,2,3,1,no,2," I had an unfortunate encounter with Lufthansa's customer service, which significantly marred my overall experience. I want to highlight that this review pertains specifically to their call center and counter customer service, not their in-flight service.  When attempting to purchase two tickets on their website, the site froze upon clicking ""purchase."" No success page was displayed. In response, I promptly called the airline to clarify the situation. They assured me that no flights had been booked. Successful Booking on Expedia: To secure our travel, we successfully purchased the tickets through Expedia. Unexpected Charge:  a week later, an unexplained charge of $3500 appeared on our credit card from the initial unsuccessful Lufthansa booking.  Contacting Lufthansa, I was informed that it was too late to cancel the flight. Despite our numerous attempts to resolve the issue, the customer service representatives seemed uninterested in assisting, consistently deflecting responsibility. We sought resolution through Amex, but our efforts were futile due to a lack of proof for the original call.  Upon arrival at the airport, we encountered further frustration. Lufthansa's representatives continued evading responsibility, resulting in no resolution.  Ultimately, my wife and I were left traveling with four seats, a predicament that was entirely avoidable. In retrospect, it is evident that Lufthansa's customer service is deeply flawed. Regrettably, this ordeal has left an indelible mark on our perception of Lufthansa. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Malta to Prague via Frankfurt,Feb-23,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  It has been more than 6 months since Lufthansa canceled my flight. They provided us with an incorrect email address to claim our refund for the canceled flight and any additional costs incurred due to the cancellation. When I emailed them with all my bills for the hotel, restaurant, and taxi expenses, I received a response stating that they had discontinued this method and provided other instructions for claiming my refund. Unsure of how to proceed and having received no response to my initial ticket, I attempted all the options described in the email. Unfortunately, nothing happened for about a month. I then searched for the customer support line number and called them, only to find out that instead of asking for a refund, you need to provide feedback in Lufthansa's process. After a little over two months, I finally learned how to request a refund. Things seemed positive as they requested information, and I provided everything they needed. Following that, they requested my bank details for registration, but since then, I've received no response. I contacted customer support, was told to wait since it hadn't been three months yet, and so I did. Now, over 6 months since my flight, I still haven't received any information about when I'll get the refund. I know the amount I'm supposed to receive, but it seems they're doing everything to avoid paying it. Today marked my last call to the call center. I had called last week, and they were supposed to contact the refund department to address my case. By the way, contacting this department is only possible via email, not through customer support or yourself. Regardless, I got a bit angry today because I haven't received anything, not even an email saying they're working on it. And all I get from team leader is a statement that I can't do anything but wait. They sent an email a week ago, and that's it — call canceled. When I called again, they asked me to speak with him, but he only sent a message that there's nothing to discuss. I requested an audio recording from agent, but I was sent to the same department where I've been waiting for a refund for half a year. In the end, I want to tell everyone that Lufthansa is an expensive company with one of the worst services I've ever experienced. Their system is designed to avoid helping customers."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Stavanger to Frankfurt,Aug-23,4,5,5,1,,5,5,yes,10,  I flew to Frankfurt from Stavanger with Lufthansa. The flight number is LH879. I have to just tell about how amazed I am. We landed 30 minutes earlier than expected. It was a very pleasant flight and I was able to catch my next flight in transit.
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,Jul-23,3,1,1,,,1,1,no,3,"  The airline delayed my baggage for 5 days while I was on vacation in Italy. I purchased essentials and sent them the receipts, but they kept sending me a series of nonsense emails trying to remove themselves from blame. Finally, I resent everything 3 times and they responded requesting that I itemize everything, as only underwear and toiletries were considered essential. They apologized several times and reported that this is all they're legally liable to do. I'm still waiting for my $300 for shoes and clothes."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 789 / 747,Family Leisure,Business Class,Austin to Bengaluru via Frankfurt,Aug-23,5,5,5,2,,1,1,no,1," Terrible experience on Lufthansa business class - my aging parents (88 and 79) were checked in, taken to gate by wheelchair and then told they did not have enough seats and only one can fly biz and other on economy. After 20-30m of arguing, begging and appealing, my 79 year old mom was able to convince they to find a biz class seat with entertainment system broken for a 9 hour flight. All this after paying regular fare for biz from Austin to Bengaluru via Frankfurt. Then they land in Frankfurt and no wheelchair waiting for my 88 year old managed to walk part way before a cart took them to next gate. This airline is a JOKE and treating seniors like this is unacceptable. Lufthansa should put some focus on taking care of seniors properly."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Catania to Munich,Aug-23,3,1,1,,3,1,1,no,2," If you want proof, that Lufthansa has now arrived at budget airline level, take a flight from Catania to Munich with this them. The departure gate was now at Terminal C which is usually reserved for budget-airlines like EasyJet. There was absolute chaos at the check-in counters with huge lines and now crowd control. The same situation at the security control. The gate area was over-crowded and 10 mins before scheduled departure, there was still no staff at the gate. Suddenly, the gate was switched resulting in hundreds of people scrambling to the new gate. Boarding was chaotic - no groups, no priority boarding. Everybody was just running for the gate, only to end up waiting for a bus in the boiling heat. The crew on the plane just said it wasn’t there fault that all was chaotic. In-flight service is non-existent- a small bottle of water is all that is provided. Food can be bought in Economy for a rather hefty price. (I gave up flying European Business Class with LH as it just isn’t worth it.) Seats are not really comfy and in my last five or six trips with LH, my pre-booked seat was automatically changed to a worse one on every single trip at least once - so, again this time."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sofia to Philadelphia via Munich / Frankfurt,Aug-23,2,4,3,2,,3,3,no,1,"  Sofia to Philadelphia via Munich and Frankfurt. What I expected to be a relatively straightforward trip turned into a series of unfortunate events.  A few hours before I departed from Sofia, I received an email notifying me that my Munich to Frankfurt flight had been canceled. While my baggage was already en route to Philadelphia, I was advised to contact an online chat assistant for help. I learned that my original flight was rescheduled from 8 am to 11 am. This change meant I'd have just an hour to make my connecting flight from Frankfurt to Philadelphia.  Although tight on time, our flight from Munich was delayed by 35 minutes. This delay meant I had 30 minutes to rush across Frankfurt airport to catch my connection. As soon as we left the aircraft, I started my running marathon with my carry-on to the next boarding gate, which took me 20 minutes. Sprinting through the airport, I was disheartened to discover another unexpected check-in process in Frankfurt. When I completed it, I presumed my flight to Philadelphia had departed without me. To my relief, but also frustration, the flight was delayed until 2 pm, presumably to accommodate other passengers like myself. Upon finally landing in Philadelphia my baggage was nowhere to be found. The delay also meant I missed the last train to Newark, DE. Thankfully, I was informed that my baggage was delivered, but an item was conspicuously missing upon inspection. "
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,Aug-23,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,no,2,"  I booked my flight with Lufthansa, and they messed up my reservation. I was supposed to be in Economy Basic and they put me in Economy Light, so I had to pay for my checked bag. I tried to change my flight and they told me it was not possible, because the class they put me in didn’t allow any changes and it was not even refundable. Nobody even tried to help me, the customer service was terrible. I’m never going to fly with Lufthansa again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Rome,Aug-23,2,4,3,3,2,1,1,no,1,"  We arrived to Berlin via Lufthansa on Tuesday, August 15,2023. The airline lost both of our bags. We came to Berlin for our engagement photos. Luckily they were able to have them delivered on Thursday, August 17, 2023 for pictures. We then on Friday, August 18 flew from Berlin to Rome. They lost my bag again. We leave for a 8 day cruise in 2 days. Lufthansa cannot provide any information on my bag. We asked to speak to the supervisor. We have medication and no one will help us. There is no sense of urgency.  Very unprofessional and Lufthansa treats the customer as if it’s our fault our bags are lost. Lufthansa has ruined this whole trip. There is no sense of urgency or empathy."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Tel Aviv to Chicago via Frankfurt,Aug-23,1,4,2,1,,1,1,no,1," It's hard for me to find anything good to say about Lufthansa. Perhaps the only possible thing is to say the crew were kind. The Lufthansa app had so many glitches, the staff in the business lounge had to delete my details and re-enter to get a boarding pass. Boarding according to group? In theory yes but not in practice. The lie flat bed is narrow, the shelf for your feet is offset so only a foetal position is comfortable. My screen was also offset and barely usable. The Tel Aviv lounge which is sad and depleted is 1 hour from the gate, with two changes of bus. As a consequence there is no flight information so if there is a delay and there was twice on my flights, there is no screen to update you. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cape Town to Paris via Frankfurt,Aug-23,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,no,1,"  Online check-in impossible. One ticket was arbitrarily cancelled on the day of departure and we had to drive to the airport to have it re-issued as it is impossible to reach Lufthansa by phone and if you are lucky enough to reach them, they cannot assist you. No email address to assist customers. On arrival at Paris CDG one of our party's luggage had not arrived. He received an email 12 hours later saying his luggage had been located and they would advise when we could collect it at CDG. It is now 5 days later. We have now received an email to say that they have not located his luggage. We have been trying to get someone to assist us at the baggage service department of CDG for 2 hours. No one is willing to assist. The option to dial Lufthansa is faulty or simply not being answered by them. We will never fly with Lufthansa again."

Turns out my seat was broken and not functional. Flight attendants were great but customer service after was awful, I was promised in writing that a partial refund would be paid, then told it was issued. After repeated emails it turns out no refund was ever paid and once I pointed out that they never issued any refund they reversed the decision and no funds would be paid to me. They then got quite rude and said it wasn't what I wanted to hear but the case is closed and no funds would be refunded but please fly with us again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Oslo,Jul-23,3,3,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I had a highly frustrating experience with Lufthansa's customer service when dealing with an overbooking issue. I was promised monetary compensation for voluntarily taking a later flight from Munich to Oslo due to an overbooking situation caused by Lufthansa. Not only was I inconvenienced by having to spend an unplanned night in Munich, but I also have not received the promised payment. Despite reaching out to Lufthansa for resolution, their response was off the mark, referencing unrelated delayed flights to Heraklion, then saying I have no right to money because my flight was cancelled.  They were all copy-pasted responses with no attention to the details of my complaint. Their lack of understanding and unwillingness to address the specific issues at hand left me feeling ignored and undervalued as a customer. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Denver,Aug-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,  Horrible service. Bought tickets directly from Lufthansa returning flights. Going and returning flights were late and ended up getting rebooked. It ended causing us over 20 hours and our seats that we paid were not honored on the rebooked flights. We expect direct flights and got nothing remotely close. Price difference between United airlines and Lufthansa was about $500 less. I would gladly pay that for better service.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Berlin via Frankfurt,Aug-23,3,3,,,,1,1,no,1,"  After a delayed flight with KLM from Edinburgh to Amsterdam, and missing our connection, we were booked on to a Lufthansa flight from Amsterdam to Berlin via Frankfurt. Lufthansa flight delayed by 2 hours and our connecting flight in Frankfurt cancelled until the next day. We enquired about our luggage and were told by Lufthansa staff that the luggage goes with you, don't worry. Arrived in Berlin next morning and no luggage. We filed a lost luggage report and said we fly out on the 11 August, and went to our hotel. Our entire holiday (4 days) without luggage. Spent most of the 4 days on the phone, and buying spare clothes and essentials. We were told by 5 different people our bags had been found and would be on their way. Once arriving it would take 24 hours to be cleared by customs, keep checking the website. I asked twice if someone could phone us, which never happened. The website is absolutely useless. It says ""we are working hard to locate your bag"". Then it says it has been found and a courier would be allocated but there could be delays. We were not at all confident that our bags would get to us before our flight out of Berlin so we changed our delivery address from our hotel in Berlin to our home address. Surprise, surprise 1 bag had been delivered to the hotel, with a damaged handle, on the morning we checked out, 11 August, even though we received an email saying the bag was with the courier and would be delivered on 14 August. Arrived at airport and went to the lost luggage section. To our astonishment we were actually able to locate the second bag. Lufthansa used to be a reputable airline but we would not give it 1 star. If something goes wrong the call centre and website are useless and you are left to do everything yourself. We were looking forward to visiting Berlin after our last visit in 1978. Thanks Lufthansa for ruining our visit."

Flight was delayed to the following day because of the typhoon hitting South Korea on 8-9-10 August 2023. It was delayed 30 Minutes before boarding. The day it was supposed to take place, time was changed once and gate was modified like 5 times at the airport. Plus the plane was parked at 10 minutes bus ride. Old plane (747-400), old seats, bad legroom, incredibly noisy at row 56. I’m tall I got up every 90 minutes to stretch 15 minutes in galleys, not disturbing anyone. I was told to go back to my seat and we should not at all walk around, Conclusion: Never again. "

What a horrible experience which started with a 7 hour delay (apparently the pilot needed time to feel a bit better - then we all know enough) business class looks and feels like 20 years ago, I tried to change date back but Swiss customer service kept saying - not possible although the ticket says it is and all their flights online showed available. Never had problems with other airlines. Complaints to customer relations were returned with standard emails referring back to useless call center. Their planes stop everywhere on the border of the airfield so every time in the bus and off course delay on way back. Luckily got the connecting flight because ta-da that one was delayed too - Lufthansa! Imbeciles! Stop with what you doing please."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Cairo via Munich,Jul-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," So here is the problem: Luggage lost & not delivered. You go file in the airport a report that your luggage was lost. You are given a reference number & told track it online, if not delivered in 5 days then we can consider it lost So you go home, go online on the luggage tracking website, surprise surprise, the reference number they gave you in the airport is a wrong reference number, so your logical thought process is to call Lufthansa & try to figure that out, I still have the luggage tag so sure someone can figure that out & verify the passenger details: You call their customer service number they tell you no you have to call luggage services. You call luggage services, they literally said this ""That's your mistake, you have to give us a reference number"", yeah but you guys gave me a wrong reference number & that's what I am calling to figure out, they literally say ""that's still your mistake & we gave you the answer"". Needless to say if you go try to create a new report for lost luggage using the luggage tag number they will tell you it has been reported already. Never seen an airline that has the face to lose luggage & call it your mistake Lufthansa quality is just like a bad joke these days."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cairo to Montreal via Munich,Jul-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," The worst airline company in the world. I was on board flights LH 587 and LH 474 on 07/25/2023. The company did not load and deliver the bags for the entire flight from Munich Airport to Montreal Airport and all what they did was an apology “ SORRY TECHNICAL MISTAKE”. A report of the loss of the bag was made at Montreal Airport on 25/7. They disable the baggage tracking service from my account on their systems by 7/31, so I am not able to know the status of the bag at all. I called them on 7/27, 7/30, 1/8, and 7/8, and every time they give me a response opposite to the other response. Sometimes they say that the delivery of the bag has been confirmed by the courier and you received it, another call the bag is on the way by courier, and the last call was very funny as they say the bag arrived at Montreal airport, but the delivery status is unknown on the system. My city is very far from Montreal airport is about 952 Km driving by car or 1:20 hour by airplane, so I asked them to share any contact such as email or phone number for Lufthansa Montreal office so I can communicate and check with my bag, but the call center says we don’t have any contact for Montreal airport. I sent more than 3 e-mails containing a complaint and details of the delayed report, and as expected no response until this moment. Is this true? We are in 2023 and they do not know where the travelers' bags have gone! The bag contains my winter clothes and some of my summer clothes, my treatment, my reading glasses, phone chargers, personal necessities, external HDD has my work and personal stuff souvenirs to my friends and many photos of my family."

✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Cairo via Munich,Jul-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," 1 star rating is quite a generous rating for Lufthansa We had a flight from SFO to CAI via MUC, so here is how it went: As any other airline, you go to ""manage my booking"" to see how many pieces of luggage you have, as it was premium economy it showed 2 pieces per passenger, as we were 2 passengers so it showed a total of 4, that's Lufthansa website &; mobile app, not a third party booking website. Went to the airport with 3 pieces, to be met by quite an incompetent staff working for Lufthansa telling me it's a website mistake, you only have two pieces of luggage not 4, so it is your responsibility to pay for the 3rd piece or we don't accept the luggage. Pointless argument for next 45 minutes, with all sort of excuses, none of which answers the most basic question, if we even accept that your website is wrong for the most basic information, why is that something that I should fix rather than the airline, the answer is simply from Lufthansa ""pay now & dispute with your credit card company"", I never heard this even from low cost charter airlines which to be fair they actually have better customer than the non existing customer service of Lufthansa. I paid $100 dollars for the luggage. Eventually on arrival they say sorry we only put 2 out of 3 luggage on the flight, 6 days & no luggage & no nothing. Good luck for any passenger still thinking of paying a penny to this airline, it is a waste of time & money & effort, if you are looking after ""basic"" experience you wouldn't even get that. Needless to describe the lack of service on 4 hours flight from Germany to Cairo"

No support on the ground and after 3 hr I was routed through Frankfurt instead of Munich - that flight was later cancelled too - ended up coming home a day later. The counters are not staffed by LH employees anymore and can only call to make changes, that took in this case over 30'. The customer service is rude and treats the customer as if we would owe them something."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Athens via Munich,Jun-23,1,1,1,1,,1,1,no,1,"  I made a reservation for another family cruise for 7 people with you which included flights with Lufthansa departing on 24 June 2023. The plane was delayed in New York JFK for a little over 2 hours. When we arrived in Munich, we were first told that we have to be rebooked because we won't make our connection. Then just before landing, we were told that we will make our connection but we have to run to the new gate. One of the flight attendants was asking us what time does the cruise ship depart from Athens? Just before landing in Athens Airport, they announced over the intercom that none of our luggage was on the plane and that we should go to the luggage help desk in Athens and file a report for missing luggage. Now I understood why they asked the question about the departure of our cruise ship. When I spoke to the flight attendant about that, she said it was not their decision, but that it was ""ground operation"" that decided not to wait for the luggage so they don't miss the flight window. Instead they decided to inconvenience over 50 people, including 7 in my family who are going on a cruise without a hair brush, a pair of underwear or an article of clothing. We were on line for over 2 hours at the luggage desk to fill the forms of missing luggage. It was a nightmare trying to function on the cruise or enjoying any activities without any of our belongings. Six days later we received our luggage in Cyprus. The largest airline in Europe should be embarrassed by such callousness of their employees in Munich. We spent most of our time buying clothes and personal effects instead of enjoying the activities on the cruise ship. To make matters worse, when I complained to the Lufthansa customer service they didn't offer any compensation or apologies for their callous decision. They said that they would be happy to welcome me on another of their flights. I would never fly Lufthansa again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Munich,Jul-23,1,3,2,2,1,1,1,no,1,"  My flight was delayed for more than three hours, causing significant inconvenience and wasted time. The process of reaching a real person in customer support was also challenging, as I had to wait with the number 87 in the queue. When I finally connected with an agent, they abruptly closed the chat without addressing my concerns, adding to my frustration. The seat allocation debacle was a major embarrassment. Upon check-in, I was assigned a specific seat, but upon reaching the aircraft, I was given a completely different seat. Worse yet, another passenger claimed the same seat, leading to an awkward situation. This confusion was eventually resolved, but not without causing unnecessary anxiety. The most distressing part of my journey was the mishandling of my luggage. Due to the flight delay, my luggage missed the connecting flight, and I was forced to fill out a form to provide details about my belongings. The subsequent emails I received from Lufthansa were inconsistent and misleading. First, I was informed that my luggage was found and would be delivered, but the next day, I received another email stating that you still couldn't locate my delayed baggage. I am deeply dissatisfied with the reimbursement policy for essential items like clothing and personal items. It is unjust to limit reimbursement to 50% for clothing needed while waiting for my delayed luggage. I firmly believe that I should be fully compensated for these expenses, as the delays and mishaps were not my fault. "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Berlin via Zurich/Munich,Jul-23,3,2,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  London to Berlin via Munich. The day before my scheduled flight from London - Munich was cancelled. Lufthansa shows in the app that I can get a refund straight away. I wasn't offered a different flight. I had to call the Customer Service. I was given no explanation why the flight was cancelled. The customer service was bad. I could not hear them despite the fact that I asked several times to speak up. My original flight was at 06:55, I was offered only late flights. 4 options were given via Brussels, Zurich, Frankfurt and one more which I can't remember. I chose the Zurich one as this one was the earliest one almost them all - operated by the Swiss. Upon arriving at Heathrow, everything seemed to be in order, one hour into waiting for my flight I got a message that the flight has been delayed. Immediately I went to Lufthansa's desk to check if I won't miss my Zurich - Berlin flight. I was told: don't worry Zurich-Berlin is late too and Zurich will deal with you, but this is not our problem here. 1.5 hours later we took off from Heathrow. Just before landing, we were advised by a Swiss crew what gates should we go to - connecting flights - once reaching the gate I saw on the screen Boarding. A few moments later they announced that the flight was cancelled and all passengers should go to Transit Desk. Once arrived there - a massive queue was there. Whilst waiting in the queue I called Lufthansa, once again unable to hear them, even though I asked to speak up, I was told no help will be given as I am already at the airport. Where should I be in Lufthansa’s opinion during the connecting flights? Just before I called Lufthansa I received a message on my app stating that I have been put on the flight to the same day late at night Frankfurt and then I would have to wait until the following morning for my flight to Berlin. I was already short on my trip. I got frustrated with Lufthansa's terrible customer service so I hung up. I was assisted by Swiss staff who managed to put me on a Berlin flight which was already closed. They had to override the system to get me on it. I managed to get to Berlin but missed my pre-booked coach and lost money. No help or support from Customer Service. On the way back I was supposed to fly Berlin-Munich-London. Berlin to Munich flight was late, no reason was given. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Frankfurt,Jul-23,4,5,5,,3,5,4,yes,9,"  Truly excellent experience with Lufthansa. Flight delayed over 2 hours due to storms in FRA, and therefore all transfer passengers would definitely miss their connecting flights as we would land after 11pm. Despite this, the crew were extremely friendly and helpful, dealt with everybody's concerns calmly and professionally, and even served free drinks in economy. Hats off to Lufthansa ( and the ground crew that then also took care of us all very well and with patience and good humour)"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bilbao to Munich,Jul-23,3,3,1,,,1,2,no,3,"  Flight was delayed by about 60+ mins on the day due to late arrival but promised late opening of the check-in counter did not filter down to ground staff on departure despite assurances over email. No update was provided on the ground by check in staff as well. Thankfully, ground staff at the airport were helpful and we could catch the flight. Check-in service staff were not the most helpful if a bit curt in their replies. The flight itself was generally comfortable and in a well-maintained aircraft although for the price of the ticket passengers could probably do with more than a small piece of chocolate and small bottled water. On arrival, there was a massive baggage delay with many other Lufthansa arrivals affected. Some customers had baggage delayed for hours and the service queue was very long. Despite the situation, the service desk closed at the published time, advising passengers to follow up their queries with the Qr Code. No additional advice was given. After more than an hour of waiting for the baggage, my AirTag revealed that the baggage was transported to another belt far from the original belt. All in all, if I have a choice I would avoid flying with Lufthansa where possible especially on connecting flights (a testament to this is perhaps the ever-long queues at the service counters)."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bordeaux to Stockholm via Frankfurt,Jul-23,4,1,1,,,1,2,no,3," This is becoming a rule when I fly with Lufthansa. First the staff is very rude and even unfriendly. Second, after we sit in the plane the pilot makes an announcement that something is wrong (this time it was to tell us that we were stuck without being allowed to take off for several hours and also that they had not received any water so they could not serve us drinks). Last but not least, we arrived but our luggage got stuck somewhere on the way. Actually this is becoming a rule now flying with Lufthansa is always an unpleasant experience."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Frankfurt,Jul-23,2,2,,,,1,3,no,1, Literal trash. I am being charged for baggage that I wasn't charged for initially. We flew from Frankfurt to Athens and I had a carry on and a backpack. I wasn't charged anything when they had to check my carry on as checked luggage upon boarding due to their miscalculation of a “full flight” AS ALWAYS. Not a huge deal just inconvenient as Lufthansa has lost my bags before. My backpack goes under the seat so I don't understand why I'm not afforded 1 space in the luggage rack. On our way back from Athens they charged me €55 for my carryon to be checked even though it was under the weight limit. The staff is almost always unpleasant and if they weren’t the only airline option pretty much I wouldn’t be using them at all.
Not Verified ,A320 family,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Sofia via Frankfurt,Jul-23,3,3,1,,,2,2,no,3," Flew from Amsterdam to Sofia and back via Frankfurt. In total, I had 4 flights and all were delayed. Disappointed to only get a small bottle of water and a small piece of chocolate on the flight. With an airline like Lufthansa I do expect more. The seats were ok, but punctuality leaves room for improvement. All my flights were delayed by at least 30 minutes, up to 1 hour. With a layover of 1 hour in Frankfurt both ways this was quite stressful. On my return flight the app did not work properly. We landed in Frankfurt 10 minutes late, however it took well over 30 minutes to arrive in the terminal due to the long taxi and bus ride. At this time my connecting flight already closed boarding according to the app and I still had to go through passport control. Much to my frustrations a group on my flight with another connecting flight, which departed later than mine, was offered special treatment to ensure they made their connecting flight, while nothing was provided to me. Fortunately, my connecting flight was also delayed, so I was still able to make my flight, but it was not a pleasant experience. I think it speaks for itself that none of my flight were on time and the service on board was lacking."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Salzburg to Bristol via Frankfurt,Jul-23,4,4,1,,,1,1,no,1,  Poor timing between connecting flights. Had to rush to make the Bristol leg. Discovered my luggage was delayed on landing at Bristol. Ground said baggage was getting loaded when asked at the gate.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bologna to Munich,Jul-23,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  For reasons of bad weather we were redirected to Nuremberg, we are now sitting on the tarmac for over an hour, waiting. No water is a being passed out, the engine has been turned off and we are sweating like pigs. Complete silence. Second time I’ve had problems with this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Manchester,Jul-23,3,4,1,,,1,1,no,4,  Paying €29 to reserve a seat on an Eco Light ticket and the fact the complimentary offerings are just a small water and single square or chocolate is terrible. The prices are too high to behave like a budget carrier. Due to staffing shortages in Germany Lufthansa also recently didn’t load any luggage but didn’t tell anyone until the end destination. Really poor service post pandemic.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Lisbon to Frankfurt,Aug-22,4,4,,,,1,2,no,2,"  On the last 20.07.2022 I receive an email saying that my flight LH1497 on 20.07.2022 from Lisbon (LIS) to Frankfurt/Main (FRA) at 05:05 hours have been delayed and the new departure time is 20.07.2022 at 11:50 hours. More than 6 hours delay. Because of this delay, I lost a connecting flight to India and spent the night in Frankfurt at my own expense. Since then I trying to contact Lufthansa Services and upon a myriad of email exchanges, I´m yet to obtain my compensation."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bahrain to Paris,Mar-23,5,5,4,,,5,5,yes,8,"  I would like to thank Lufthansa with all my genuine emotions. We lost our baggage on our return trip from Paris, upon raising lost baggage claim we were attended immediately by Lufthansa staff and Bahrain airport authority. According to their guidelines we waited over a week and proceeded to delayed baggage compensation and received it. As like any other person i lost hopes in getting it back since i received the delayed compensation and couldn't find anywhere to lodge it as lost baggage. It had my kids trip memoirs and collection. Now all in for a surprise after 4 months i received an email stating it has been found and duly forwarded to Bahrain airport and as of today i received it. I cant thank enough Lufthansa keep up the good work. Will definitely fly again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Frankfurt ,Jul-23,1,3,2,3,3,1,1,no,1,"  My flight to a Frankfurt connection was diverted to Dusseldorf because the Frankfurt airport closed due to a drone & security. The pilot said we were refuelling. Everyone thought the plane would then return to Frankfurt. Instead, without any direction, we were told to exit the plane. We had no idea what was going on, eventually ending up in baggage collection. Half an hour later, a staff member showed up & said we should collect our luggage & would be driven back to Frankfurt on buses. This took 5 hours. By then, everyone had missed their onward flights. No one met us as 5 huge bus loads of passengers exited at Frankfurt. Again, no one knew where to go. Eventually, everyone found their way to Lufthansa Rebooking. I stood in line 3 hours.  At this point no one had been offered water or food. After at least an hour in line, some snacks & water showed up, the first & only customer consideration. The agent who waited on me did not have a clue what she was doing. She wanted to book me on a flight to Chicago, long layover, then PHL. I said I wanted to be booked on the same non-stop flight to PHL. After an hour, she rebooked me for that flight leaving 3 days later, gave me a voucher for the night, & said I had to come back to the airport the next day to get a voucher for the following night. The hotel was a 20 min. shuttle bus drive. Next morning, I left the hotel on the return shuttle bus early in order to get back by the last shuttle bus at 10:50 or wait for next one at 16:20. I had to wait in line again in the Rebooking line another 2 hours to get another voucher. The agent went into my ticketing & said she had to go upstairs to documentation because of a problem with the previous rebooking. Apparently I had been rebooked via Chicago one day & a second booking direct to PHL 3 days later. When she returned, she handed me to another agent. He rebooked me on a direct flight to PHL with EW Discovery but one day later not 2 days later. He gave me a voucher for a different hotel & complicated directions to taking the train there. I said my luggage was at the previous hotel I was sent to yesterday. He said he didn’t know anything about yesterday. He was very rude & condescending. By the time I was finished with these 2 people, I had missed my shuttle which meant I could not repack my luggage & checkout by noon. I called the hotel & had no choice but to book another night there which I had to pay for out of pocket.  When my rebooking confirmations came through, I received 2 for check-in: One for the next day, the other for the following day, same flights. I checked in to the flight for the following day. The plane did take off the next day, & I was on it. But EW Discovery economy was the tightest seating I have ever been in.  Needless to say, had I known I’d be booked in a sardine can on a partner airline I never heard of for $2200, I would never have booked Lufthansa. And because of the worst customer service ever & uncomfortable partner airline, I never will again. I will warn my friends, family, & anyone traveling abroad about my retched experience with Lufthansa."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rennes to Oslo via Frankfurt,Jun-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,2,"  I had round trip via Frankfurt to Brittany, France. Prices for flight tickets increased drastically from 2019 to 2023. But what about quality of Lufthansa's service onboard, it has gone down in comparison with the pre-pandemic era. Forget about quality and tasty meals and beverages for free. It is not anymore included in flight ticket prices as well as choice of it. Onboard Lufthansa staff throws you one small bottle of the cheapest water from Denmark in plastic bottle and after 10 g bar of the cheap chocolate. On my final fly from Frankfurt I got very unpleasant neigbourghood from my back seating place. Crew told that they cannot replace me due no free places."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Vancouver via Frankfurt,Jun-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  The customer service I received was absolutely appalling! They messed my booking up, the check in, seat selection, the list goes on. The call centre staff couldn't understand me and weren't willing to help. I've flown all over the world with many different airlines and have never experienced such horrendous service. I will never fly with Lufthansa again and encourage others to do the same."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Cape town via Frankfurt,Jul-23,2,2,1,3,,2,1,no,3,"  We flew from Cape Town to the UK via Frankfurt, the out bound trip was okay. The food was terrible, almost inedible. The return trip was a disaster. The flight out of the UK was delayed causing us the miss the connecting flight home. The flight eventually landed at 22:30. Frankfurt airport shuts down at 22:00, including the in transit hotel. We were forced stay in the transit terminal without food or water until 6:30 the next morning when the Lufthansa service desk eventually opened. We were put on to a Qatar flight departing at 17:00. 19 hours in the transit area. We will never fly with Lufthansa again and never pass through Frankfurt airport again."
Not Verified ,A320-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Bangkok,Apr-23,2,1,1,,,2,2,no,2,"  I flew this flight with Lufthansa a few months ago and I still can't get over just how much of a bad experience it was. The meal service was particularly bad, the food was basically inedible. The breakfast just before arriving in Bangkok was unbelievable. I was really hungry after the very small portion of pasta the night before and was looking forward to the breakfast. It consisted of a yoghurt and a sandwich which I think was ham. I couldn't say for definite since it was frozen solid as was the yoghurt. The flight attendant couldn't care less after I pointed it out to her. Even had we got metal cutlery it wouldn't have cut through it, the plastic stuff we got was extremely cheap rubbish. We never got to see the attendants after the one serving from the drinks trolley. On the return journey from Munich to Manchester I fancied a gin and tonic only to be told it would be 7.50. Having paid out big money for the flights I couldn't believe they were charging the same as budget airlines. Never ever again."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Chicago,Jul-23,3,4,3,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Horrible experience since checking in for flight. We were leaving Chicago, was not able to select seats through Luftansa and was told to pick it 24 hours before actual flight. Flight didn't take off and sat for 2 hours on the tarmac. The entertainment system did not work on the way back to the states and the flight attendant tried to get it restarted and didn'twork. No USB to charge phone since it's an older airplane. Worse is when we landed in Chicago yesterday, we still don't have our luggage a day later. All passengers on flight LH430 - after waiting for over an hour were told to file a delayed lost luggage online. The cargo door could not be open was the answer they gave us. You need to do better Luftansa, we spent 7k for 3 people and an infant with you and your flight partners. We wanted German precision but you delived sub par performance at a premium price, we will never fly with your airline again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Business Class,Brussels to Munich,Jun-23,3,4,3,,,3,4,yes,7,"  Boarding was unfortunately difficult caused by passengers with too much hand luggage. Flight departure was with a short delay - an acceptable cold breakfast was served with cold cuts and some cheese. FA were friendly - nothing special, nothing wrong either."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Bologna via Frankfurt,Jul-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,  Our flight was delayed and we missed our connecting flight because they did not have anyone to transport passengers to the connecting flights terminal on the other end of the airport. They caused us to arrive at our destination over 14 hours later when the rental car counters had all closed so we lost our rental car reservation and had to book a hotel room and wait until the next morning. Then we had to rent a more expensive car because our original reservation was missed due to the late flight. On top of all that they lost one of our bags and returned it to us 3 days later in terrible condition. The bag looked like it had been dragged though dirt and beat up. We had to spend even more money to buy clothes for the 3 days we didn’t have the bag. I tried numerous times to call and email and you get absolutely no help from anyone. Just an email reply saying sorry but they will not do anything to compensate for all the additional costs they caused our family and nothing to make up for the worst flying experience we have had in our lives. 
✅ Trip Verified ,A319/A321,Business,Economy Class,Berlin to Catania via Munich,Jun-23,1,1,,,,4,3,no,4,"  After several disappointing trips with Lufthansa Business with terrible seats and inedible food, I decided to fly Lufthansa Economy only when using this airline. The boarding process was easy and well organised. The seat was rather small and flimsy with not much legroom. Lufthansa forked out a small bottle of water - that’s it. No free food, no free drinks. Honestly, I don’t see why not flying budget carriers - there is no difference except maybe the real priority boarding offered by the flag carriers."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Munich,May-23,4,4,4,4,,4,3,yes,8,"  Flight on economy class was fine and as expected. Seat was comfortable, flight on-time, and inflight meals were good. Economy class service was good as well. Overall, no complaints at all."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Tirana via Frankfurt,Jun-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Worst service my family has ever received. First, the flight was delayed, and then they changed the gate and didn't give enough time for the people to move to the new gate. My relatives missed the flight and nobody took responsibility for that. They even have the audacity to ask for money in order to give them new tickets for the next flight and then after a lot of arguing they accepted to give tickets at least, but nothing more. My relatives had to stay for 24 hours in the airport, Lufthansa didn't compensate for anything, no hotel, nothing. We will definitely avoid flying with this company ever again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Toulouse to Montreal via Munich,Aug-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," In June 2022, we were going back to Montreal from Toulouse (with a layover in Munich). The plane left Toulouse over an hour late, which made us miss the flight from Munich to Montreal. We had to wait 4h in line to get the tickets for the hotel/cab + plane tickets for the next available flight (24h later) to Montreal. The next day we got into the plane, the plane was nasty. I tried putting my bottle of water in the compartment in front of my seat and as I reached to put it I touched used, humid Kleenex from the previous passengers. I was about to take a picture of it when the stewardess saw me and changed our seats. The new seats we’re as nasty as the previous one, coffee stains on the table, visible old journals in the compartment, hairs on the other table, etc. That was at the time when Airlines companies were supposed to clean the planes very well in between flights (for obvious COVID reasons), we we’re also still required to wear a mask at all times. Two days after my arrival, I wrote a complaint and asked for the legal compensation for the missed flight (over 24h forced stay in Munich) and I also complained about the dirty plane, asking for a supervisor to call me. I did not receive and calls, only a weird email asking me for my banking information, which I replied to saying I wasn’t comfortable giving this information that way. It took 5 months (November 2022) before I received another email stating that it was a safe way to give my information through the website. I did send my banking information through the website shortly after that, reiterating that I also wanted to receive a call from a supervisor. I didn’t receive any calls nor any compensation whatsoever. I tried contacting the customer service department a couple of times, they would either hang up on me or make me wait for hours until the line would magically cut. At one point I was able to speak to someone, who confirmed to me it could take a couple months for me to receive something. Its been over a year now, I still haven’t received the call, I warned them that I would file a complaint to the OTC, asked them to settle this with me before, they didn’t reach out to me. I filled the complaint, still wrote to them that I was willing to settle it in a friendly way but they still refuse to call me. So for all the reasons above, I give the lowest rate I could give to this airplane company. The planes are not clean, they do not respect their customers, they do not respect the laws. Do not encourage that type of behavior, book with another company."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to Stavanger via Frankfurt,May-23,3,4,,,,1,1,no,3,  My return journey from Barcelona to Stavanger via Frankfurt was horrible! It took a little extra time to fly from Barcelona to Frankfurt and meanwhile connecting flight got cancelled/left and my ticket was reissued having a 10:30 hours transit. They issued a voucher of 15 euro for lunch but it didn’t work at their participating shops! I emailed them to reimburse but didn’t hear back from them. I was exhausted spending those 10:30 hours without kind of cooperation. Even couldn’t avail another convenient flight of them that could reach me early as they said that their server wasn’t working.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Vilnius to Munich via Berlin,Jun-23,2,3,,,,2,1,no,1,  Unbelievably disappointed for mishandling my delayed luggage and offering completely insufficient compensation. Unacceptable service and lack of empathy. Avoid at all costs!
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Birmingham via Munich,May-23,1,2,2,2,2,2,1,no,1,"  The quality and value for money of upgrades to business and premium economy are appalling. I paid significant amounts to upgrade my passenger class due to an accident that occurred on top of existing mobility limitations. I was desperately in need of a more comfortable return trip. I was extremely disappointed and after the trip, Lufthansa didn’t even bother to respond to my emails. I had to chase them several times and their interest was nil."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Skopje via Frankfurt,Jun-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa doesn't care for the passengers! In my case, they were late 1.30h in Chicago, and we landed in Frankfurt 20 min before the departure time! It took us about 15 min to get out of plane, and the gate which was again connection with Lufthansa was so far, we made it 5 min after the scheduled time, and they already left. When asked, they said that the plane was overbooked, and they couldn't wait for us. So they take off late and the same company doesn't care to wait 5 min. Instead they will run away early, because they sell the tickets twice. They made us wait in the airport for over 12 hours to wait for the next flight, and gave use $15 voucher to eat. $15 for the whole day? This was the biggest joke. The worse experience ever in 20 years. Stay away for Lufthansa! In the plane, the screen wasn't working, was so boring not being able to watch a movie. My ticket cost me around $2000, and I got no service for the money I paid. I have never seen such a careless company!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A330 / Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Nairobi to Los Angeles via Frankfurt,Jun-23,3,3,2,,,2,2,no,3,"  First leg, JRO-FRA- boarding process was a mess and dis-organized. Business class - Only one person at the gate checking boarding passes. Flat bed not comfortable. No rest rooms in the front of plane. Two restrooms that were shared with economy comfort and occupied. Second leg, FRA -LAX - again same issue with boarding. Business class - only one person at gate checking boarding passes and everyone pushing to try to get through. No orderly queue. Flat bed more comfortable because there was a mattress pad. In general, one of the worst airlines that I have used and will not fly Lufthansa again."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Sofia,Jun-23,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  Luggage payment was not included in the ticket price. I had to pay extra 75 CAD at each airport. None of them accepted cash. In Toronto, the payment machine did not recognise my Visa card. I was sent to another counter where they issued a card with 75 dollars in it plus 9 CAD for the service. In Sofia, the card worked but instead of 101 units in local currency, I was charged 101 CAD (I lost another 26 dollars). One may say 35 dollars lost is not a big deal. True, but the problem is with the nerves. On top of the stress with checking in, security check and wasting time (you must be at the airport 3 hours before the departure time and departure was late by a whole hour) comes the stupid requirement to pay separately for the luggage. Not online or within the ticket price, but at the airport. Never again Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,São Paulo to Frankfurt,Jun-23,1,1,4,2,,3,4,no,6,"  I flew from São Paulo to Frankfurt on the 1st June. The flight was almost completely full. On this 12-hour flight, we were placed in seats next to a partition, with no possibility of any movement to recline the backrest. The seat was only completely vertical. I spoke with the flight attendants about the problem. I noticed that there were 10 or 15 free seats in economy-plus / premium economy. I talked to the team again, I spoke about the discomfort of traveling for 12 hours in that seat, but they were totally inflexible. The 10-15 economy-plus seats were empty for the entire flight, and we had the backrest upright. The lack of flexibility and understanding of this discomfort on the part of the onboard team was astonishing."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321 neo,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Edinburgh to Frankfurt,Jun-23,5,4,2,,,2,4,yes,7,"  The check-in was a bit hesitant, since the staff acted a bit uncoordinated and the staff were not well pre-sorted by boarding numbers. Especially in a destination with a lot of older travelers not really well organized and prepared. The flight and the aircraft used were in excellent condition and there were no complaints."
✅ Trip Verified ,Embraer 195,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Bristol,Jun-23,3,4,3,,,5,4,yes,9,"  From check-in (1 day before) to arrival in Bristol everything was to our complete satisfaction. The seat spacing on the type of aircraft used was a little smaller than usual, but was easy to bear due to the short flight duration."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Trondheim to Venice,Jun-23,3,2,,,,2,1,no,1,"  I flew with Lufthansa now 2 times, from Trondheim to Venice. I had to change flights in Munich before going to Italy (April and June) and both times my suitcase was missing and the plane was late. I do not recommend."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sarajevo to Milan via Frankfurt,Jun-23,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,no,1," Both outbound and inbound flights were delayed by close to two hours, and this happened every single time when I took this airline to destinations in East and Southeast Europe. The positions we received in Frankfurt and Munich were always outside positions which made it nearly impossible to catch the connecting flight and, attitude of LH staff on the plane and on the ground in the airport is arrogant and unfriendly."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Naples,Jun-23,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,2," Left our bags in Munich, so we're stuck on vacation unable to do the things we came to Italy to do. Their excuse? The ""current situation"" with air travel - shorthand for not wanting to pay for enough baggage handlers. Makes you not want to bother traveling."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Warsaw to Frankfurt ,Jun-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Absolutely unpleasant and the worst flight I've ever had. They delayed flight and caused me to miss the connecting trip, which I also booked from Lufthansa (bus express). In addition, I lost my baggage because of it and nobody at the customer service point could help out. Person A (from Lufthansa) would say a completely different thing to person B, and so on (I talked to a number of Lufthansa employees, and each of them said different things). I had to get my connecting bus ticket three times (they made me miss my bus three times because of my lost luggage). The worst was when I was approaching one of the employees and with a very unfriendly tone, she said: ""Nobody can help you now. Come back tomorrow morning."" I was roaming around the airport at midnight for hours asking them and that's what they told me. They even do not give me any compensation during the lost baggage period. Extremely disappointing."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Cape Town,Jun-23,1,1,1,1,,1,1,no,1,"  Absolutely shocking customer service. Lost luggage, said they would pay 50% of costs for clothing for two small kids and an adult - not sure what law that represents. The worst is that the official helpline is utterly terrible. I've spent short of 6 hours trying to get through to someone. The end result is that the helpline for baggage is ""just an information centre"" and can't actually tell me where our lost kids clothes are. They ""make a request"". This is abysmal."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bucharest to Montreal via Munich,Jun-23,3,2,2,3,1,1,1,no,1,"  On my return flight from OTP to YUL, on June 13 I was denied boarding because Lufthansa overbooked the flight. They refused at the beginning to offer an alternative flight, but after insisting they offered an alternative flight with Air France. Because of this I arrived 5 hours late and Lufthansa offered me a Passenger receipt for a compensation. Even though i have a document from Lufthansa mentioning that they need to pay me 600Eur they refuse to pay it."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Chicago,Jun-23,1,1,3,1,1,4,1,no,3,"  Had 5 total seats. One seat the in flight entertainment screen was not functioning, 2 seats had the light stuck on over half the flight (8 hours). Flight left an hour. late Flight attendants were not interested in helping. As others have noted there is no service from attendants during flight. Overall poor experience from the ""flagship airline"" for Germany."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vilnius to London Heathrow via Frankfurt,Jun-23,2,2,2,,,1,2,no,1," The worst flight ever. Delay to incoming flight resulted in a two hour delay in departure. No information or explanation given other continued changes to departure time on boards. Boarding procedures chaotic. Although cabin bag size restriction is published, this was not enforced, leading difficulties in place correct sized bags in overhead lockers. Choice of food available for purchase on board very poor. Cabin staff unhelpful. Information given re onward flight affected by delay given re other flights but not to London Heathrow. On arrival in Frankfurt no stand available causing further delay, when stand was allocated, plane had to move to another since offloading equipment was in the wrong place! Before disembarking told London flight was being held for 15 minutes. After a race across the concourse, arrived at gate in time to board, only to be told flight had already closed no information. Gate staff officious, rude and unhelpful. Do help with any information as to how to re book onward flight, or when that might be. Eventually given new boarding passes for flight already boarding, so another dash to new gate."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Toronto,Jun-23,5,5,5,5,,5,5,yes,10,"  After checking in online and receiving my boarding pass I noticed that in the LH App my seat was not the same as the one on the boarding pass but 1 row in front, separating my wife and myself. When dropping off the bag at LH in Munich I was informed that my original seat has an issue with its electronic and as a precaution I was assigned a different seat. The check in agent then rearranged both my wife's and my seat to perfect different couple seat and all was really super. I was impressed that Lufthansa realised that there is a seat issue in advance and proactively cleared all issues. Boarding on the 15th of June for LH 494 was not as smooth as it could have been but acceptable. In flight service was top notch with very friendly and efficient attendants, meals very very well presented and of the highest quality. Plane was clean and in-flight entertainment good. LH Business Class seats are a matter of taste and admittedly I prefer those to the cocoon like atmosphere of others and when travelling as a couple just perfect. Choosing D and G seats will also eliminate the aisle access issue. Plane landed a bit before the scheduled time. A very pleasant flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A319,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Ljubljana to Frankfurt,Sep-22,4,5,5,,,4,4,yes,8,"  European short haul business class can not be compared with international, the seating is very different normal standard class seats with a spare seat in the centre. However for this short flight it was adequate. Service onboard was friendly, if a little mechanical. Food served was pretty nice with very tender beef with mashed celeriac and, a chocolate pudding and delicious bread roll and butter. A wide choice of drinks were offered, wine, beer, soft drinks, tea coffee etc. The flight attendant came around several times on this short flight offering further drinks and tidying up. We also received the very tasty Lufthansa branded chocolate."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Ljubljana via Franfurt,Sep-22,4,5,4,,,4,4,yes,8,"  Our flight experience Lufthansa was good. The app was very useful and worked perfectly, we were able to check in and download boarding passes without any issues, information via the app was useful not having travelled via Frankfurt before and directions we needed to follow on arrival were of particular use. Our flights were reasonably on time and flight attendants on both legs were pleasant and attentive. We were given a small bottle of water and a tasty Lufthansa branded chocolate. Having had a large breakfast at Manchester this was all we needed."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Toronto,Jun-23,2,2,2,2,,1,1,no,3,"  I had 2 bags one carry on and one checked in bag that I paid for. On my way from Canada I had no issues. Everyone was lovely and things were okay. On my way back from Nice to canada. The staff asked me to pay for my carry on luggage as the measurements were bigger than usual. I informed them that I had no issues coming to nice with that same luggage and was checked in by a Lufthansa employee. The customer service at Nice airport was horrible. I should’ve been informed of this when I was departing from Canada.  There are no real standards or rules. And obviously it varies from airport to airport, which is extremely stressful.  This was a Lufthansa staff error. & they still had me pay for the bag."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Chennai to Frankfurt,Jun-23,1,1,1,1,1,3,2,no,2,"  Absolutely pathetic experience, nowhere close to what I heard about Lufthansa. Cabin crew was not approachable or friendly, almost felt like they have been sent to do their jobs on gunpoint. Ran out of food options too quick and what we got was inedible by any standards. Seats were very hard and uncomfortable, pillow case and blankets were very dirty. Tray table was not cleaned. Worst of all, no headphones were provided on a 10 hour flight nor was the WiFi working. Absolutely the worst experience on any airliners flown so far."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Bangalore via Frankfurt,Dec-22,2,3,2,4,3,4,3,no,5," I flew Lufthansa three times last year (twice to India and once to Japan). The India flights were, rather surprisingly, alright, and the Japan one less so. But my problem is not with the flights themselves, but rather with Lufthansa's frequent flyer programme ('miles & more'), which is simply atrocious. First of all, there is no possibility anywhere of interacting with a human being. For some reason, the flight mileage is seemingly arbitrary. Whereas my daughter and I flew together, she got no mileage for two of her four flights and I got nothing for one (a different) sector. How do you fix this? Well, you go to their website and scan in your boarding pass and submit the request. You get a cryptic (by that I mean idiotic) ""reply"" but you cannot reply to that and ask for a clarification! All you can do is to redo the same thing you just did. Secondly, I just tried looking to see how much credit I could get with my miles towards a ticket for my kids. How do you do this? Well, you login to the miles & more website and ask for a flight on the dates of interest. Back a message saying that unfortunately no tickets are available for the dates requested, but perhaps changing the dates might help, alongside a helpful link back to the previous page, instead of showing you a grill with availability on dates a week before or after. So you go back to the previous page and has it kept your data? Of course not! They clearly do not want you to use your mileage. It's truly pathetic and unworthy of a major airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Frankfurt,Oct-22,1,1,1,2,,1,2,no,2,  Very disappointing and infuriating. Paid for upgraded seats - given the two middle seats of a row of four - hideous when going to the bathroom several times over a long flight. Cabin crew annoyed that we were not happy about our money being stolen by their company for services not given. Practically threw our food and drink at us the whole flight - it was ordinary at best anyway. To give credit we did arrive more or less on time and safely so really that is what you ultimately want. However then ensued several months of emails trying to at least get a refund for the services not supplied - no joy with this and in fact some very weird emails promising refunds which never materialised. What a waste of time - would never fly with Lufthansa again and definitely would not recommend. I'm was really surprised that the German national air carrier is so abysmal!
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Frankfurt,May-23,1,3,,,,5,1,no,3,"  I ordered an exit seat that allows for more space for your legs and paid 85$ for it. The ground steward confirmed that I have this seat. However, when I boarded, I was given a different seat. The flight attendant apologized and said that I should reach out for the customers' care for reimbursement. I sent 4 letters to customers' care, each time required to provide more explanations for this very simple event. Finally, they answered that the company does not take any responsibility for this and that they will not reimburse me. Bottom line: bought something that was not provided and was not reimbursed. I find this unacceptable."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Frankfurt,Jun-23,1,1,1,1,1,3,2,no,2,  Awful overall from start. Plane loaded illogically from front to back so last on battling through others. Food awful and special diet food forgotten about until asked for. Response given not apologetic but annoyed. Touchscreens nonresponsive. Seat recline very difficult and earpiece plug not functioning in 1 ear plug. Staff unfriendly and abrupt. Leg room shrunk in last years too.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Belo Horizonte via Frankfurt & Sao Paulo,May-23,3,3,4,4,,1,1,no,1," Problem was not the flight, although we had to run for the stop-over in Frankfurt (don't take a stop-over of 1.20 hrs). Real problem was the luggage. Had to pay 500 euros extra for 2 extra suitcases (OK) but our stroller/baby car went for free. This stroller/baby car consists of 2 parts, the bed and the frame with wheels. The frame with wheels never arrived in Sao Paulo (due to Brazilian law you have to pick up your luggage at the first entry in Brazil). Made a report via the Lufthansa website and then it's waiting but nothing happened. Called the luggage department 3 times and they just tell you to wait. Although they ask about a list of contents, which I already filled in . They gave me an email address to mail to send the pictures to, afterwards you get a nice email confirmation. But the pictures are never added to case! After 5 days still nothing. It looks like the luggage department can't just call Frankfurt and asked if it arrived there, then call Sao Paulo or Amsterdam lost luggage (only 3 calls or 3 computer systems, that shouldn't be that difficult). During the calls they constantly ask you for the list of contents, which I filled in off-course, but you can't upload of picture of the lost item (then it would be found pretty quickly). Yes, I can claim 50% of the value, but strollers in Brazil are different and not as good. They should just find the stroller frame with wheels. If the bed part can arrive, why not the stroller? So flying with Lufthansa can be fine or cheap, but if you luggage is lost, you are doomed and can't even speak to somebody normal."
Not Verified ,A320neo,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Vancouver via Frankfurt,Jun-23,2,2,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  We had a flight from Brussels to Vancouver with a change in Frankfurt. Normally we would board in Vancouver 4th of June at 11am to start a cruise. Our flight in Brussels had a delay of 70 minutes, so we missed our connection in Frankfurt. Still on the plane, taxiing to the gate, we received an email that our flight to Vancouver was rebooked to Monday 5th June, that was not ok because the cruise started on the 4th. At the customer desk, after a waiting time of 90 minutes, the lady was very rude, she gave us a flight with a stopover in Chicago and a (theoretical) arrival in Vancouver on the 4th at 11h 33am. That was too late, by no means we could arrive on time to board our cruise ship (11am). The lady was constantly pointing her watch to make clear that her shift was over, she only spent 10 minutes to solve our problem. She threw the new flight schedule on the desk, turned around and went away. I was totally in shock. In our life we have made a lot of travels to all kind of continents and with all kind of carriers. Never, never were we treated in such a brutal, disrespectful manner. We took a train back home, a sad ending of our dream cruise. I would not recommend travelling with Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Munich,May-23,1,4,1,3,1,3,3,no,4,"  Any longer flights will no longer be done with Lufthansa. They are charging premium prices but lacking the premium experience. The food was terrible, the seats were cramped and uncomfortable. WiFi came at a premium even for messages only. Many of the changes made by Lufthansa over the years remind me of budget airlines like easy jet. The very reason I flew with Lufthansa was the more Premium experience, such as being able to choose a seat on check-in free of charge. Ironically, the flight to San Francisco, our first stop on a road trip, was with United who had great food, very generous service and comfortable seats. It's sad seeing what's happened to this once great airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Washington to Riyadh via Frankfurt,Apr-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Absolutely awful at each level. Lufthansa has completely lost it. Under the pretext of COVID, Lufthansa has become extremely cheap. I have been a miles and more loyal passenger for at least a decade. During booking the lady was extremely rude and would not confirm if tickets were refundable if cancelled within 24 hours. In Washington and in Frankfurt the food was extremely sub standard and choices limited and on both flights I was not given the special meal that I had ordered. I have specific dietary requirements and despite confirming the meal twice before travel, they messed up my meal. During my flight from Frankfurt to Riyadh, the boarding was a horror. Passengers were not segregated according to class and it was almost a free for all. The ground staff was extremely rude. I requested that lady that perhaps passengers could be segregated according to class and made to board according to zones. To which she replied sarcastically how thankful she was to learn from me. I wrote several emails to Lufthansa asking them to address this and never got a reply. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Barcelona via Toronto,May-23,3,4,3,3,3,4,3,no,5,"  I was not able to do this online myself as their online booking system kept telling me to contact customer service for any add ons. I missed a step when I was originally booking online and I ended up booking my seat from Barcelona to Munich and not from Munich to Vancouver. I was willing to pay for my seat.  I didn’t have roaming on my phone so I used my friends phone. I googled how to reach Lufthansa from Spain. I couldn’t call their 1800 customer service number because it didn’t work from Spain. I googled everything from what area codes to use from Spain to call Lufthansa using a Canadian phone. Well let me tell you with all this technology these companies have they don’t make it easy on the customer. It’s not enough we have us do all the work ourselves when booking tickets and checking in, but its hard reaching customer service when you need them. Their online system is not user friendly and when it tells you to contact Lufthansa directly, but they don’t offer you a phone number let alone a number for calling from Spain or other foreign countries even though they have offices in these countries. After I managed to find their number on Google and it said it was Lufthansa’s number I ended up calling the Barcelona Airport. Finally, I did reach Lufthansa’s offices in Madrid. This woman picked it up and she was speaking in Spanish. I asked her if anybody there speaks English because I know no Spanish. As soon as I said that her attitude changed. She kept telling me that she didn’t speak English. I asked if some else there did? She said nobody. I told her all I wanted to do was book my seat, but she kept telling me to call this old number that didn’t exist because I had tried it. The irony was this woman kept speaking to me in full English sentences, but then she would say I don’t speak English? She would say “Sir you have to call this number for help” “Sir nobody speaks English here not even my colleagues” “Sir we have no manager here to help you” I told her that her English was fine & that she was speaking to me in full English sentences.  I was pleading with her to help me.  I got my friend to call her & talk to her in Spanish, and she told my friend that she couldn’t book our seats & to wait till we got to the airport. She told my friend that all the seats were booked. The next morning when we arrived at Barcelona Airport we checked in at the Lufthansa counter. We told this agent what the woman on the phone told us about there being no seats available and he couldn’t understand why she would say that because he said there were many seats available. Lufthansa needs to take responsibility for the lack of service from their staff behind the scenes. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Windhoek via Frankfurt,May-23,2,3,1,2,1,2,1,no,2," Really bad service, they cancelled our flight to Frankfurt 3 hours before departures, giving us no option to reebok. We had to flight to Namibia and had everything organized the option they gave us was to reroute on 2 days later losing money and time. So we booked a train that we paid ourselves, we did several claims and calls - no answers, no help, no refunds. We paid for a ticket and for a train, a lot of stress, the train was full and we had to stand for 4 hours. I'm writing this out of frustration, we live in Germany we have Lufthansa credit card, the miles and more program. It is getting after covid the worst airline, expensive and with bad customer service. It is not like before. Do not book with Lufthansa, do not subscribe the credit card, do not join the miles and more program. Use Air France it is way better"
✅ Trip Verified ,A321-200,Business,Business Class,Munich to Catania,May-23,1,2,1,,,1,1,no,2,"  Lufthansa used to be a very good airline but in recent years they have practised cost cutting to a level that impacted customer experience, food and service quality and is simply not acceptable anymore for a flag carrier. I had a much better travel experience during my last couple of flights with low-cost airlines than during my last 8 or so Lufthansa flights. There seem to be barely any LH flights that leave and arrive on time. In the last week, I took five LH flights and every single one of them was delayed. At this occasion we were told that the crew arrived late and needed to have a briefing and, in addition there were no baggage handlers available. So, we finally took off 40 mins late. I specifically booked a seat in the first row because I have rather long legs and got my boarding pass only to find out during boarding that LH changed my seat and I was bumped back a few rows. As there was no change pf aircraft, there must have been somebody more “important” than I which is not a good feeling. (I would have not even said anything if they put some seniors or people with special needs there but the people they put into my booked seat were some intoxicated rich youngsters.) So much about recognising loyalty which doesn’t seem to have a significant role in Lufthansa’s playbook anymore. Food portions were so small that I thought the airline handed out an appetizer before lunch only to find out later that this was actually the meal. Over the last years the food at LH got worse and worse and the portions are constantly getting smaller. The food was beetroot and some inedible celery salat with some cold meat cuts (no idea what kind of meat). Being German myself, I do know that beetroot and celery is part of the diet in some parts of the country, but I just don’t see why people of cultural backgrounds other the German would eat this. I suppose the food in Business was not worth more than about 3 Euros. There is no free food or drink service in Economy at all, The only thing Lufthansa is giving out for free for all customers is a piece of cheap chocolate and an apple (no joke). So, here’s the “verdict”: With Lufthansa it is not worth paying extra for premium seats, at least not on short or medium distance flights. There is no free food or drink service in Exonomy Class Loyalty recognition is non-existent. Food is terrible and comes in “appetiser” portions only. I can’t see why anyone would pay extra for no extra service unless one wants a free apple and an appetiser (but for the extra price of the premium ticket, one can buy 20 kilos of apple plus one or two bottles of champagne)"
Not Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cluj to Toronto via Munich,Apr-23,2,3,3,3,,1,3,no,3,"  On April 11th, I checked in for the April 12 flight Cluj-Napoca to Toronto via Munich. At the check in Lufthansa offered an upgrade for premium economy. I payed for the upgrade and next day to the airport I was told that I am on stand buy at Munich. When I arrived at Munich, I was told that I don't have the upgrade because Lufthansa sold more upgrades than the available seats they have. Arriving home I waited for Lufthansa to return the money, which didn't happened. I had to fill up some forms twice and almost o month to get the money back. Very disappointed with Lufthansa."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Krakow via Frankfurt,Dec-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa misplaced 4 out of my 5 suitcases between me and my flight party.

I am keep asking about the compensation, money transfer, and I am only getting back basically copy and paste massages that they have transferred the funds and I need to wait few more days. There has never been any transfers. Lufthansa is simply playing some games. Very unprofessional. Today in May 24 2023. 5 month later. Nothing was sent. They even stopped responding to my emails."

My journey started with a friendly check-in in Frankfurt. Although the Business lounge before entrance to Z gates was very busy, there were enough seats. Food and drink options were very good with a big choice of alcoholic (sparkling wine, spirits and beer on tap) and non-alcoholic drinks. On board the service was fantastic. The female crew member in my section was very friendly and attentive. Business seats in 2-2-2 configuration with a lack of privacy and storage space, but they are still comfortable. IFE had a very good selection, although the quality oft the screen could have been better. The food was very good, both taste and presentation. Drink selection was great including Champagne, a great Spanish red wine and raspberry brandy. One negative aspect was the missing free WIFI for Business class passengers. While there were different options available for reasonable prices, I think WIFI should be free for passengers in Business Class. Overall I was satisfied with Lufthansa’s Business Class while some parts could be improved."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Athens via Munich,May-23,2,2,,,,2,1,no,3,"  This review is of the extremely poor customer service. It all began in January 2023 when I purchased two RT tickets from Denver to Athens, Greece. The first leg of the the trip, Denver to Munich was a Lufthansa flight for which I paid $185 for seat assignments Row 18 H/K.  Fast forward to flight check in on April 29, 2023 and my seat assignments are not what I reserved. An hour and half later, and finally speaking to a Lufthansa rep and she cannot help me or refund my purchased seats. I am instructed to apply for a refund on-line after travel has been completed. It is now one week since I have returned from Athens and I have not been able to receive a refund. The on-line system won't recognize my booking code even though it shows ""verified"", and I receive error messages. I have made six calls to customer service with no service at all. I have been disconnected two times, and on other calls I am told that the ""system is down"", ""you have to do this on-line"", ""supervisors are unavailable to assist"", and ""due to the high call volume, I can't get you assistance"". The last call ended with the representative telling me to ""call back in 15 minutes"". I wish for this review to focus only on the customer service center. My actual flight experience is another review and equally poor. Lufthansa should be ashamed of all aspects of their service. I will not use this carrier again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Amsterdam,May-23,2,3,1,,3,1,1,no,3,"  Due to the delay of LH flight from Frankfurt to Amsterdam, I missed the Cathay Pacific connecting flight to Hong Kong. On the ground there was no service provided to me to rebook me to another flight or offer any remedy help to get me back to Hong Kong - Cathay Pacific was guilty too. After, I returned to HK, I contacted Lufthansa for compensation. Their reply was “bad luck” and the request for compensation was not entertained. Their reason was that the delay was less than 3 hours."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Berlin via Munich,May-23,3,3,1,1,,2,1,no,3,  Very bad airline. 2 delays on both flights.

We booked bassinet seat on February 2023 via their customer care and when we reached airport to board on April 2023, they told us that basinet seat is overbooked and we do not have the basinet seat. Same experience in the return flight too. We had to fight at the counter for almost half an hour at the time of boarding to get us basinet seat at the end. So it was never double booked but they lied to us. Also, very bad experience with their coordination with partner airline. Their partner airline got cancelled and rescheduled but Lufthansa did not update the itinerary. I had to call them to update it but guess what on the day before flying , they randomly cancelled our booking again with the partner airline. Overall, I spent about 10 hours in one week fixing the airline reservation issue as well as basinet issue. Will never book with airline ever again."

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Tokyo Haneda,Mar-23,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  
I am still paying the price, for my unforgettable mistake of booking flights LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo on March 22, 2023, and LH717 from Tokyo to Frankfurt on April 17, 2023. To start, one of our bags was delayed for more than five (5) days, and the airline's customer service at the Frankfurt Airport was unhelpful in resolving the issue. Despite spending over an hour discussing the problem, we received no information about the status of our bags, and they seemed indifferent to our inconvenience. Thankfully, a service agent who overheard our conversation, and helped us establishing the status of the missing bag. Furthermore, Lufthansa's reimbursement policy for the toiletries and clothing was unclear and unsatisfactory. We were informed after the fact via email that Lufthansa only refunds 100% of the toiletry items and 50% of the clothing, we had to purchase in Frankfurt and at the airport before our departure to Japan. Although we filed the expense reports with corresponding copies of the receipts on April 27th, we have been receiving daily emails stating that they cannot issue reimbursements due to the lack of receipts, which were originally filed. This has been a frustrating experience and has resulted in repeated filings of the same receipts. During our return trip from Tokyo, we were assigned a seat in the lower deck of the business class section, which was broken, making the 11-hour and 40-minute flight extremely uncomfortable. When we brought this to the attention of the head flight attendant, she was apologetic, but did not offer any solution other than the manual manipulation of the seat, every time we needed to change its position. To our surprise, two members of what we believe was an orchestra seated in the upper deck of the business class section with their cellos strapped into chairs next to them. Instead, we had to manually manipulate the seat every time we needed to change positions. Although the flight attendants offered to compensate us for the damaged seat, they changed their minds three times,  For the high price of a business class ticket, I expected much better treatment and a more comfortable experience.

✅ Trip Verified ,A340,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Venice via Frankfurt,Apr-23,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  
My family and I were so excited to visit Venice for the first time, and booked an April 1 departure flight from Hong Kong though Frankfurt with Lufthansa.  Firstly, they canceled my outbound flight just a few days before without automatically rebooking me on an equivalent flight (incredibly, they just removed the segment from my itinerary), with just a discrete email sent to me. I felt myself lucky that I checked my email a day before going to the airport and realized what had happened. As their on-line rebooking system was completely useless (ie. they had simply removed the cancel flight segment without a trace from my itinerary, and so the on-line system could not even find it to rebook.). After 30 minutes of frustration with their useless chatbot, I called into their customer service line, and then the next 90 minutes of pain really started. I tried both their local HK and German hot lines, with a reasonable wait each time, but each time a few minutes into the call, the line would simply cut off. This happened whenever they put me on hold, and sometimes at other random times also. After trying both mobile and land lines at my end, I realized this was probably Lufthansa's IT system issue which the agents seem obvious to. In the next calls, I had to beg the agent to call me back if the line dropped so that they could complete the rebooking transaction. None did for about 10 tries! The Asia-line call center was particularly horrible, as the agent was incredibly rude and evasive, trying to argue immediately that Lufthansa had no responsibility to handle the case as the original ticket as booked through an on-line agent (I booked through Booking.com, whom I had already call. They indicated the Airline was the only one who could make the booking change). Incredibly the agent spent about 3 minutes tried to find every opportunity to evade instead of just solving the problem, and eventually the line dropped (or perhaps he just hung up on me!). Incredible that Lufthansa hires people like this for customer service.  That night, after nearly 90 minutes of trying, I finally got someone on the German call center who was kind enough to call be back after the system dropped the call. She said she rebooked me on a KLM flight that departed half a day earlier and despite the horrible experience, I thought I was saved! Next day, a Friday, my family (4 of us) rushed to the airport to catch the new flight. We had to pull both of our kids out of school a few hours early, and I left work early as the new flight departed mid-day Friday, instead of the original we booked which was early AM Saturday, just after midnight. We didn't realized the horrible April Fools trick Lufthansa has played on us until we reached the KLM check in counter. With 2 hours before flight departure, the counter agent informed us that Lufthansa has incorrectly rebooked the flight with wrong ticket numbers and we could not get on the flight."

There was a strike so at the airport they rerouted me over Munich on a flight not affected by the strike. No problem, it happens. My flight to Munich, unfortunately, left with delay so I missed the connection in Munich. And then it started. Since it was already late the Lufthansa staff in Munich to just organize your own hotel and they would provide a refund after which they just closed the office. Now they refuse to refund the hotel.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Berlin via Frankfurt,Jun-22,2,3,3,,,1,2,no,1,"  If you are ever promised to be reimbursed for expenses when they lose your luggage, don’t ever count on it.  My two kids and I flew to Germany several months ago. When we arrived in Berlin, my suitcase was no where to be found. I stood in line for over an hour. When I finally reached the front, I was told the bags were normally located within a day. They promised they would “do what they could” and that I would be reimbursed for any expenses that were incurred. The documents they handed me stated the same. The next day: no bag. I continued to check the website, call and email. No response. The website for lost luggage just stated it was still missing. We left and stopped at several second hand stores to find cheap clothes and other necessities, including a small suitcase and toiletries. I thought I did pretty well and kept the cost under $500.00. EXACTLY ONE WEEK LATER We were in Munich when I received an email notifying me the suitcase was in Berlin. The email had a phone number to call with any questions or concerns. No response to emails. Phone calls bounced through automated systems like a pinball. I selected every option throughout the entire system and never reached a live person. Two weeks later we arrived back in Berlin where we would stay for two more days before flying home. I went to the airport to finally retrieve the luggage. I parked in the temporary lot which allowed for 20 minutes of parking before fees incurred. I went in and, after much hunting, located the area where the lost bags office for Lufthansa. Literally hundreds and hundreds of suitcases, bags, etc. It took 40 minutes to find it. I mentioned paying the fine for the parking. The rep stated: “You can add it to the claim for reimbursement. Just keep the receipt”. We returned home and, within a couple weeks, I sent off the claim and receipts, along with copies of the original lost bag documents and emails I had received. After a month I received an email requesting I send the documents for the claim again. I resent the documents with the information. Six weeks later, I received another email requesting my ticket information and address. I sent the information back again with the message about a third time After two more months I received a final email: “Thank you for your feedback We sincerely apologize for the unintentional delay in responding to you. As Per your email, we regret to hear that your baggage was delayed at your destination. We can imagine what it meant for you to travel and not have your essential items as you intended. Please accept our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused to you on this occasion. Liability for baggage is clearly regulated by law, and we must fulfill certain criteria in order to be able to meet your request for compensation. The passenger must indicate the damage amount and prove it with the help of receipts, e.g., sales receipts or credit card receipts. As much as we understand your irritation, we are unable to comply with your request for reimbursement of the expenses for your replacement purchases. We hope for your understanding that we cannot pay damage compensation under these circumstances. We nevertheless hope to welcome you on board a Lufthansa flight again soon."""
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Hamburg,May-23,3,1,1,,,2,2,no,3," Lufthansa allows a standard hand luggage 55cm 8kg plus 1 item (laptop bag, no weight requirement). Entering the plane, there was no space at all to place a hand luggage in the cabin overhead bin. That was because all the passengers had already placed there not only their hand luggage but also their plus 1 items, jackets, etc. I informed a flight attendant about this, she apologetically told me ""I know but now it is difficult to fix this"", an attitude I respected although the problem was not fixed. A bit later, another flight attendant tried to ""help"" me however he was not even able to place my small plus 1 item in the cabin bag. Then, I told him again that there are numerous bags in the overhead bin that should not be placed there and they should be moved underneath the seat so that the 55cm luggage can fit. He just started lying to me about the weight of the hand luggage, claiming that both items should weigh up to 8kg (which is a cheap lie according to the official website of Lufthansa) and everyone has done the same here. That is rudeness at a different level, I've never encountered anything like that because flight attendants are super polite and helpful typically (1st time flying with Lufthansa though, maybe that's the problem here). He also claimed that the laptop bag is typically to be used in the overhead bin and the 55cm underneath the seat, that sounded so ridiculous. All in all, instead of trying to help a customer who apparently has paid so that he is able to travel with a decent sense of comfort (without having to place his feet between a 55cm luggage on the floor while keeping the laptop bag at hand during the entire flight), the flight attendant tried to blame a passenger for his own shortcomings being unable to arrange a correct baggage placement in the aircraft! I have NEVER seen such an attitude by a flight attendant in so many flights I've been present. To the contrary, all flight attendants typically rearrange the luggage and try to solve any problem so that everyone can fly in a decent setting. I will certainly never use Lufthansa again, it was the first and last time I did and I would discourage anyone using this airline that does not care about customer service at all!"
Not Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Madrid to Munich,Apr-23,4,5,5,3,3,4,5,yes,10," I feel more like telling others of positive experience. And my Lufthansa's flight from Madrid to München/Munich 26. April was a very good experience. A brand new, very clean aircraft, a wonderful welcoming crew - and above all, a very good, hot meal (I chose chicken breast). I'm impressed - this was only a two hours flight. Good wines."
✅ Trip Verified ,Embraer 190,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Frankfurt,Apr-23,1,1,1,,,2,1,no,3,"  Lufthansa has now become the European legacy carrier cutting costs to compete with the growing low cost carriers. Nearly everything extra is now charged, checked bags, seats, food etc. To change flights sometimes costs more expensive than buying a new ticket, and from my past four flights with them, none left on time. They have announced a new cabin refurbishment, I am skeptical."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Cape Town via Munich,Dec-22,3,3,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  Our flight was delayed from for 3 hours it then took off and diverted to a different airport 3 hours later. It stayed here for another two hours due to weather conditions (which happens) what was not acceptable however, was not providing any food. By this point my children hadn't eaten since midday and it was now 9pm. It then finally arrived at Munich at 2230 and we disembarked at 2300. Told to head to the service desk to see what was next, especially since a lot of people including us had missed their connection flight. The queue was huge and the very helpful help desk closed at 0000 before most people could get any information. A tannoy announcement came over saying they could not provide any hotels, but people could either get a hotel and then claim it back or were welcome to stay at the airport, on the floor, and check on the flights at 0600 the next day. No substantial food was offered. A twix and juice carton was provided to substitute the missed meal. We opted to go for a hotel as we had young children. Unfortunately the taxi queue was also huge! To make things worse it was outside in the snow, and well into the minus numbers. What turned this experience from awlful to utterly ridiculous was that we had barely any warm clothes as our final destination was South Africa in the summer. We had to wait an hour before we could get a taxi. We were not allowed to collect our baggage which we may have been able to add a few more layers, as it had been transferred to the flight tomorrow. Or so the tannoy said. We were unable to confirm this, as previously mentioned, the help desk closed. I checked on the app and it did appear that we were on the same flight the following day. I was unable to reserve seats to ensure we were sat together as the flight was less than 24 hours away, but that was a task for tomorrow. That morning I discovered that I had in fact been kicked off that re-booking. According to the app I had now reached my final destination and so the seats were now vacant and booked by someone else. I attempted to use the app, online portal, the live chat and calling up the help line number, none of these could help and told me I had to go the the service desk in the airport. I then spent from 0945 till 1205 in a queue to speak to one of the 5 people working in the service help centre (I was number 3538 and when I got there it was at 3342) there were 12 desks for attendants to work from, but Lufthansa decided that the queue trailing the length of the airport only justified half filling those positions. Finally I was told that it was a glitch in the system and that there was nothing they could do about it but would book me in for the following day. So me and my family had to spend another day in mid winter with no warm clothing. Luckily the there was no issues with the next flight, except that our laggage was temporarily missplaced. We did manage to recover it and headed out for our holiday thinking that the worse was behind us. This was just the outward journey. The I was informed on 4pm the day before the flight home. It had been cancelled! I spent 4 hours on hold to get in touch with the ever-so-helpful Lufthansa online chat number 372 in queue! They informed me that the link flight from Frankfurt was cancelled due to bad weather condition and would not find a replacement flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Munich,Apr-23,3,5,4,5,5,5,5,yes,9,"  I took a return trip from PL to US this April and the crew was amazing. On the way there I had to call them to come as I had a problem with a passenger behind me - crazy woman who had three seats to herself but wouldn’t let me recline when I tried to, the crew came and helped me deal with that. On the way back the crew were smiling and very helpful. The food was good on the way to USA, worse on the way from USA but I’ve been traveling there for almost 20 years and that is always the case. Overall the trip was really good. Only tiny complain I would have is there space is little small on the A350."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Philadelphia via Frankfurt,Oct-22,1,4,2,2,,1,3,no,3,"  The last time I flew with them my return flight was canceled 1 week prior to my trip (and the year before it was cancelled during my trip!). The proposed option was to rebook us (myself and my husband) onto a Eurowings Discover flight! This is outrageous as an offer as that is a low-cost flight and we booked Lufthansa. Instead of resorting to this option I decided to call and get rebooked to a United flight from a different city (Newark). I called the number provided in the cancellation of my flight email from Lufthansa, but the person I spoke with was a third-party agent and unfamiliar with their job. I had to give them step by step instructions on how to proceed - and their incompetence totally screwed us up on our return. The night before my flight I could not check in as our return tickets were not being recognized. I spent hours of time with a United customer service agent. The agent eventually booked our seats assignments, but when I reached the airport we could not check in! We then had to go to the counter and the agent there had to fix our tickets as my husband wasn't even listed as a passenger. She told us that this was Lufthansa's fault for not entering proper code data. If we hadn't had seat assignments we would have missed our flight. After flying both Lufthansa and United, I can say United is better. This is shocking to me as previously Lufthansa was far superior but their standards have drastically changed. The food is bad, the entertainment selection is mediocre, and worse the seats are horrible! The only positive is the staff was friendly. It was so uncomfortable and I am used to the trek across the ocean but this past time was unbearable. I will now do my best to avoid Lufthansa for all future flights - it's not worth it!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,St Louis to Frankfurt,Dec-22,2,5,5,3,,5,1,no,3,"  When called customer service was told 2 days before trip that my confirmed reservation had changed from STL-Frankfurt round trip to Frankfurt -STL round trip. This was after 4 dropped calls. They charged $700 for my spouse and myself to correct their error. Despite multiple emails, they have not responded other than canned emails requesting patience. If you must fly them, avoid any questions to customer service which appears to be an outsourced travel agency, for profit. We were foolish enough to be trying to ascertain cost of upgraded legroom seat, but had a really expert shakedown. On the good side, ground and flight staff great"
✅ Trip Verified ,A340,Business,First Class,Munich to Miami,Mar-23,3,2,1,1,,3,2,no,4,"  Flight was done in a worn A340 - despite a very personal welcome by the captain all the other items were not okay not for First Class. Hot towels are gone, F&B operations were not appropriate for First Class. There is some caviar however with one tin of 100 g FA must serve 8 people. Other appetisers were very so-so, and beef cheeks is not a luxurious product. Also the fish was not nice. The second meal was ranging from rather fat cold cuts to stewed fruits. The wines were not very attractive and cheap mineral waters were thrown out of plastic bottles in a kind of carafe. For First Class a rather limited alcoholic drinks - despite friendly one of the FA was not qualified to do the service in First. Lufthansa in First : a poor experience the result of a rather serious zeal of economising despite the very high fares. A very hefty deterioration in standards and the red rose in front of my seat could not change my mind that I did not enjoy my flight at all. There was an amenity bag however not in leather."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Phnom Penh via Singapore,Apr-23,,,,,,5,5,yes,10,"  When checking in at LHR we were informed of a 1 hour delay to departure, which would likely have meant missing our connection to Singapore (1 hour 25 minutes). Without prompting, the check in agent suggested they rebooked us on a Singapore Airlines flight direct to Singapore. They checked that the Singapore airlines flight had availability and took us to the sales desk to get us rebooked. As a result, I am writing this review from the lounge in Singapore while anticipating an on time arrival in Phnom Penh. Without the Lufthansa check in staff’s thinking, it is likely I would be boarding a plane in Frankfurt around now and reaching Phnom Penh a day late."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Bergen,Mar-23,3,2,1,,,1,1,no,3,"  At check-in in Frankfurt only business class or above have a staffed counter - everyone else has to struggle through an automated system. Once on the plane flying economy you get a bottle of water and a tiny piece of chocolate, Not only do have to pay for a warm drink but it is also not good and you have to use a card to pay. I flew back with KLM which still treats passengers like customers. I will avoid Lufthansa if I can in the future."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Istanbul to London via Frankfurt,Nov-22,2,4,4,,,1,2,no,2," Never again. First time I've flown with Lufthansa in many years and my first time flying in business class with them. The post-purchase experience is absolutely appalling. They are incredibly difficult to contact and incorrectly denying any compensation claims. They send you repeated 'copy-paste' responses that don't correspond at all to your submission, then stop replying altogether. There was no in-airport support at Istanbul, we were denied access to the business class lounges when they cancelled our flight (which was their fault) and offered absolutely no compensation or support. The planes were dated with poorly maintained interiors. Very friendly cabin crew though. I don't see myself flying again with them internationally any time soon."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to New York JFK,Apr-23,1,5,1,,1,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa economy seems to work out to be more expensive then its premium economy option by charging extra fees for everything under the sun. It seems almost disingenuous after seeing the price of very basic amenities stack up to more then you would have paid for a more pricey ticket. All in flight services felt extremely low budget. Everything was hidden behind a pay wall. I payed 18 USD for their second tier “fast” in flight wifi that would not even suffice to write this review at the time of my flight. The in flight meals were about as basic and cheap as possible. My advice would be to take your chances with another airline. On the only positive note I can think of, the flight crew were very friendly."
Not Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Cairo via Frankfurt,Apr-23,3,3,3,4,,2,2,no,1,  I was Traveling to Egypt from Miami via Frankfurt. My flight from Miami to Frankfurt delayed by one hour but once I was at the terminal I ended up waiting another hour on top of the delay making it two hours delayed. In Frankfurt my flight was once again delayed although only half an hour.  On the way back our flight Cairo to Frankfurt was delayed by 12 hours which caused us to miss our connection to Miami - after an hour on the phone with Lufthansa we figure out we are getting back to Miami with a flight the day after. In Frankfurt the next day for the last flight going from Frankfurt to Miami the gate changes to 30 gates away from the original. Once getting to the new gate and waiting for 30 minutes an announcement saying that the boarding process would not begin for another half hour after it was scheduled.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Mexico City,Mar-23,1,5,2,1,,4,3,no,6,"  I have been a loyal customer of Lufthansa both for economy and business flights for over 16 years, being my second preference after SWISS. Flying long-haul with them for the first time after the pandemic, how things have changed! It was the worst in flight experience. The hardest seats one can possibly imagine for an 11h flight. Terrible food, and in the smallest quantities, no snacks, no fruit for in between. And the entertainment console, I could not even imagine something this terrible can exist in 2023. It was touch screen but mostly an instrument of torture for your fingers, and the slowest thing one can imagine. Not too great of a selection either. Paid internet available. Obviously their safety record is great, and I am happy they got me to my destination safe and on time. But it would have been nice if they did it with a bit more comfort. I am really disappointed to see what was a really great airline to fall so low in terms of service. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Houston,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,,1,1,no,1,"  The plane from Amman to Frankfurt is old, seats are hard and flight attendants not helpful or friendly. The boarding process is inefficient. The plane left late and arrived late. With a narrow time with the connecting flight, we have to use the back door of the plane and take a shuttle to get to the airport terminal and then go through security again. In Frankfurt, the desk assistant was slow . People are lining up to ask questions and to ask for upgrade and about 20 people on the line waiting for assistance.  The boarding process is again inefficient, slow, and late again. We have to go down steps to board the plane again. I will never take Lufthansa again. No TV on the plane from Amman to Frankfurt and plane amenities are old and no WiFi. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Thessaloniki to Munich,Mar-23,4,1,3,1,5,1,1,no,1,"  It was my worst experience ever. My flight was from Greece to Dublin via Munich. We were not aware that in the Munich airport had some technical issues and the majority of European flights, were being cancelled. Although the pilot prior take off from Greece and due to a flight delay mentioned about these issues in Munich no one bothered to inform us that we might lose our flights and be stuck in Munich. The following 2 days it was known that the staff in Munich airport was in strike so no flights. During the flight I found out that my flight from Munich to Dublin was cancelled. When I asked the flight attendant what am I supposed to do and why they did not inform us earlier to find another option to travel to Dublin, she replied you may be able to travel to Dublin on Tuesday, 3 days later."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Toulouse via Frankfurt,Mar-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," I think the fact that Lufthansa states “We are aware that due to the steady increase in personal and business travel, we are currently unable to provide you with the excellent service you have come to expect from us” says it all. When customers book flights, they are entering an agreement (typically an expensive one) with the airline. In our case, we upheld our side of the bargain and Lufthansa consistently failed to uphold their end of the bargain. Never mind “unable to provide you with the excellent service you expect” - this was well below “does not meet expectations”. Our Journey from Hell - STEP 1: We originally were set to leave Dallas to Frankfurt for a connecting flight (both Lufthansa) to Toulouse. For reasons outside of our control/not related to weather, the plane was delayed. We chose to try to make our connecting flight instead of rebooking after speaking to the person at the front desk. We spent the entire 9 hour flight stressed about whether we’d make it in time. STEP 2: Our connecting flight was delayed - pretty on brand and a trend that would continue for the rest of our journey. At first we thought it was our lucky day, we sprinted across the entire first floor of Terminal A and up 5 flights of stairs to get to our terminal. WE MADE IT AS THEY WERE STILL BOARDING! We did everything in our control as the customer to be there, yet alas - as we presented our boarding passes, the attendant realized they had given away our seats to standby passengers that were standing right next to us. He pulled us aside, and as we were waiting for him to check our tickets, they continued to let other passengers board. We were finally told they only had 1 more seat left and moved us to the next flight which was a total of 6 hours later (plot-twist: you guessed it, that one was delayed by an 1.5 as I’m writing - AND COUNTING!) The icing on the cake is that they tried to give us $15 meal vouchers for our trouble, but upon presenting them to a vendor, they had not been loaded. DO WE EVER MAKE IT TO OUR DESTINATION? That is a question we still have no clue what the answer will be. We’re going on over 8 hours of total delays, the airports are closed tomorrow due to strikes. Also who knows where our bags are. I can only hope they uphold THEIR side of the agreement and get us to our destination. If you as an airline or business cannot uphold your end of the agreement, and continuously fail to meet the agreement, then it is my opinion that refunds should be provided. I will NEVER fly this airline again and will be sharing this story broadly with my friends, family, and any acquaintance on my socials."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Dublin,Feb-23,3,5,,,,1,1,no,1,"  It is now over a month since Lufthansa confirmed refunds in relation to a cancelled flight. Despite both email and verbal confirmations of refunds, Lufthansa have yet to honour the refund payment. It is unacceptable that a refund would be confirmed and then not actually paid, particularly in the circumstance where I had booked another flight with Lufthansa in order to return from Munich following my original flight cancellation. I have now in effect paid twice for my family to fly home. What makes this all the more frustrating, is that despite completing numerous “Customer Feedback forms” on the Lufthansa website, no one is responding to my queries and if any response is received it is an automated one. I have attempted three times to speak with a customer services representative and on every occasion they state that the “refunds department” is dealing with the request. At no point have I been able to speak to the refunds department and at this stage I believe Lufthansa to not be honouring the refund and frustrating my ever attempt to receive clarity on the situation in an effort to deter me from pursuing further. It is easily the worst customer service experience I have had with an airline. Which is saying a lot given issues experienced during the pandemic. Truly disgraceful and very disappointing."

Food was below average and for a 10 hour flight after food service they provided only a small bag of crackers. No additional drinks or crackers were avalable in the galley. When asked for more I got another small cracker. MIA-MUC-BUD: IFE touchscreen is a disaster. Booked payed seats and they reseated us for what? IFE did not work on those seats! Only one soft drink service for a 9 hour flight, dinner was average but the morning breakfast was the most disgusting sandwich. Luthansa has definitely became a below average airline. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Budapest to Denver via Munich ,Mar-23,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  Customer service is rude because they know they don't need to be otherwise. I asked in Budapest for information on how to leave a comment and they said that there is no way to do so. They said they are not Lufthansa they are just the contracted agency. Therefore they said they do not need to follow Lufthansa rules. So, even though I checked with a Lufthansa representative, they said it is my responsibility to check with them. I was only able to bring my purse, so I am now going to have to hand carry all of my laptops, iPad, cords. I have no bag for them because they don't fit in my purse. This is the most illogical thing I have ever encountered. I will do every thing I can to not take Lufthansa. They are a really bad airline"
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Munich,Mar-23,1,1,3,4,3,2,2,no,1,  Legroom in Economy was below minimum. With the Backrest in front of you at the back position you cannot eat or have a tablet on the table.  The seat becomes uncomfortable after 3-4 hours.

Lot of movies to decide and an USB-Socket. 
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Prague,Mar-23,3,5,5,,4,1,4,no,9,"  Definitely not a big fan of Lufthansa but this time it was a joy flying with them.

Planes are clean and in a good condition, but service level is minimal. A bottle of water and a piece of chocolate is all you get. No further drinks or snacks available, not even for purchase! I was looking forward to get a coffee in the morning but was disappointed. Crew gave out water and chocolate, then disappeared. WIFI didn't work on both flights and Inflight Magazine is gone. Fares are high, service is low, that’s Lufthansa now. Nevertheless recommended because of their reliability."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Manchester,Mar-23,5,4,1,1,1,4,3,no,5,  Service is now worse than budget carriers. A free bottle of water and a chocolate don't make up for the ridiculous fees for changing seats etc. Planes are clean staff are friendly but service is no better than a budget carrier and pricing is premium. Every opportunity to extract money is taken - you can't even pick a seat at check in and when a seat is allocated the fees to change are high. The app often doesn't work as it should and presents errors preventing you from making changes to bookings.
✅ Trip Verified ,A340,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Munich,Feb-23,1,4,1,3,1,1,1,no,1,"  I booked a round trip on United Airlines ORD-MUC-BOM. The sectors MUC-BOM-MUC were operated by Lufthansa. I paid an additional amount to ensure an aisle seat. On the return leg, BOM-MUC much to my surprise I was allotted a middle row seat. On arrival MUC I contacted LH Customer Service but was summarily told to go online with my complaint. These people should not sit behind Customer Service counters if they do not know how to talk to customers. I submitted my complaint on-line and received feedback from Lufthansa - ""Thank you very much for contacting us regarding your flight. The respective operating carrier, who has access to all relevant flight operations data, is best suited to address flights which fall under EU regulation 261/04. We have therefore forwarded your correspondence to the operating carrier UA to facilitate the fastest and most accurate answer. UA will contact you as soon as possible. We thank you very much for your understanding."" The payment I made was directly to Lufthansa and not United Airlines. Lufthansa is simply avoiding their responsibility and deflecting from this service failure. I have heard of other instances where Lufthansa makes you pay for a preferred seat and does not assign the seat at the time of boarding."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Warsaw via Frankfurt,Dec-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Had an absolutely horrible experience with Lufthansa. My parents were traveling from Denver to Warsaw with a layover in Frankfurt.

I will never use Lufthansa again and do not recommend it to anyone else."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Cape Town,Feb-23,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,no,1,"  I flew in business class in one of the most uncomfortable and derelict seats I’ve encountered. The seat lacked any cushioning in the top 2/3rds of the back, because the adjustable airbag system had permanently deflated. I was told they could not reseat me because all remaining business class seats were also broken. The IFE system reset multiple times and was unresponsive for minutes at a time, and the tray table refused to stay concealed within the arm rest, as the latch was broken. The seat offered no privacy and angles adjacent passengers towards each-other, increasing opportunity for uncomfortable incidental contact with strangers. The airline offered me no form of compensation."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Zurich,Feb-23,1,3,1,,,3,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa has good flight slots and modern aircraft, but that's about it. The seats are uncomfortable, the food is abysmal or non existant but the worst is the customer service. The IT services are regularly down, making it impossible to rebook your flights. The callcenter does not answer, waiting times of more than an hour are normal. Sometimes you have to drive to the nearest airport to rebook your flight, and this in the most expensive fare classes Economy and Business Flex. No apologies ever. Add to this the ridiculously high fares and you have a wannabe premium airline with a sub-par service which is often below the standards of Ryanair, Easyjet, Vueling or other low cost carriers. Unfortunately, Lufthansa holds a monopoly on many European routes if you want to fly non-stop. Be cautious if you book this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Miami to London via Munich,Dec-22,1,2,2,,,1,1,no,1,"  I flew from Miami to London via Munich business class in December 2022. The lie flat seats are the worst I've ever experienced in a business class -  they recline all the way, but they're two seats next to each other, and there's no privacy, no storage space. If you're by the window, then the person next to you, when they recline all the way, there is absolutely no way to get out - their legs are too high for you to climb over, so if you need to go to the loo, you have to wake them, get them to sit up so you can get out, then they have to wait for you to come back before they can settle down again. The little bag of goodies contained a couple of tiny tubes of moisturizer - no earplugs, no eye mask . And when we got to Munich for the connection, we had to climb down 6 flights of stairs, onto a bus, be driven out to the plane, climb up another flight of steps. They lost my bag for 4 days, but their website says you can buy essentials up to the value of 1500 pounds sterling - and they'll reimburse you. I spent $83.02 in total, on essentials, I submitted my claim on 1st January - 30 days later - nothing - I contacted them and they said ""we never received your claim, you're now out of the window to make a claim, tough"".  I had all the receipts  and I told them how angry I was. They said as a favor to you, this one time, we will reimburse you. I waited and waited and sent emails. Then I was told oh, we did pay you but by mistake cancelled the payment. They said they'd do it again, to be patient and wait two to three weeks. I waited. I pestered them, they said oh we've sent the wire, here's the payment confirmation (just some numbers, which do NOT constitute a wire confirmation number) and to check with my bank to see why it hadn't been received."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321Neo,Business,Business Class,Funchal to Munich,Feb-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Dreadful airline these days. I had selected window seat 6A some weeks before the flight and then had an email two days before my flight stating that my seat had been changed to 4D, an aisle seat. I very much dislike aisle seats as I detest other passengers or crew brushing past me. On boarding the aircraft I saw that 6A and 6C had been given to a couple travelling together. So I feel that Lufthansa discriminated against me as a solo traveller and gave my seat to others so that they could conveniently sit together, even though they clearly booked and / or chose their seats later than me. There was absolutely no consideration to me or my preferred seat selection. On arrival at Funchal Airport I was also informed that there is no lounge. The whole idea of travelling in business class is to be able to escape from the main passenger contingent and get some peace and quiet and a nice drink and a snack. No such possibility at this airport. I have travelled quite a lot with this airline in recent years and have witnessed a clear deterioration in standards."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Bangkok via Munich,Feb-23,5,5,4,4,,5,5,yes,9,"  Excellent flights on Lufthansa, Manchester-Munich-Bangkok on the A319/A350. Comfortable seats on both flights and warm friendly professional crew, served a decent meal (chicken teriyaki) on the long haul sector and good choice of films to watch too. Music and TV choices were a bit lacking although as these were night flights I was happy to sleep for most of the time, got a decent sleep both ways which is always a bonus in economy! All flights on time, service pattern perfect for when we wanted to sleep / eat. Overall very happy with Lufthansa despite reading many horror reviews recently, flying with them saved us a tonne of money and I'd happily travel with them again long haul."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Marseille to Singapore via Frankfurt,Feb-23,1,1,1,2,,1,1,no,1,"  On the outward journey on January 16, 2023, between aperitif (strong alcohol at an additional cost) nothing to snack on and the really bad meal, more than an hour has passed (only one team of hostesses per lane in economy class). At breakfast no hot drinks, a glass of water served with something inedible for me. On my return on February 22, online check in, departure from terminal 3. I arrive in Singapore before 1 p.m., no more early check in before 4 pm. I wait and I go to terminal 3. where there is no Lufthansa, I end up learning that the company is in terminal 2 for flights to Frankfurt and Munich. Return flight: a bottle of water accompanied by some biscuits, so the service is much faster. Tasteless meal, breakfast with coffee accompanied by a sandwich. The Boeing 747-8 fitted out for as many people as possible, it's the very discomfort from seats to toilets. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toulouse to Frankfurt,Jan-23,2,2,,,,1,1,no,1,"  My luggage was delayed for more than 2 weeks and Lufthansa handled it very badly. There was no communication at all from their side, getting someone on the phone took me 1h everyday and the person on the phone told me several time ""our system is not working now, try to call later"". 2 months later I still haven't received any compensation. Their customer service is stuck with a robot sending me emails asking for my address even if I already replied the same message 3 time.  If everything goes well you might have a good flight but as soon as their is any small problem they cannot handle it."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cluj-Napoca to Miami via Munich,Feb-23,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa used to be my primary go to airline, but lately I has turned to s%. I booked more than one month ahead of the travel date. The flight got cancelled hours before the planned take off, at a time when I was loading the luggage in the car to get to the airport. Since I have a travel insurance, I asked Lufthansa for the cancellation reason to use with the insurance company. As a response to this request, Lufthansa has never stated the cancellation reason offering instead a financial compensation to settle the issue and I have sent an email of acceptance to which I got no further response. 10 days after, I've asked for an update and I got an email requesting further documents. After me sending the further clarification requested in a matter of hours, all communication from Lufthansa's side stopped. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Bucharest via Munich,Dec-22,,,,,,,2,no,1,"  This was a return flight and only the outbound flight was with Lufthansa. The flight was cancelled due to weather. If you use the automatic chatbot to rebook you lose the ability to rebook your returning flight. In my case it was important to rebook the return due to arriving late at the destination by one day. If you use the chatbot to rebook only the cancelled flight you are unable to rebook the return (online, via phone, chatbot). If your flight is cancelled give them a call immediately to rebook your itinerary if needed.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Chicago,Feb-23,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Worst flight experience of my life. First of all the food was horrible, and the WiFi connection was even worse. The seats were ungodly uncomfortable and on top of that they made us 30 min late and I missed my flight and now I'm about to get home 3 hours late. For your sake never fly with these clowns."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Delhi,Feb-23,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  Very disappointing experience. My food was really poor, cold bread, terrible coffee. Limited movie selection, poor music selection, mostly German music. I needed to stand up to stretch my legs but I was forced by the crew to go back to my seat. My flight back has been cancelled and rebooked on a flight with six hour connecting time without any compensation. The overall level is not better than that of a low-cost airline. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Rio de Janeiro via Frankfurt / Munich,Feb-23,5,5,3,3,,3,2,no,3,"  I purchased an airline ticket with Lufthansa to Rio de Janeiro, departing from Istanbul on February 7, 2023, returning on March 1, 2023. I arrived in Frankfurt and went through customs and passport procedures and arrived at the boarding gate. I waited for my boarding for flight LH 100 which was supposed to take place at 10:15 am with an estimated arrival time of 11:10 am. It was then that the nightmare began. We were informed that the flight would be delayed by 20 minutes and with that it was already certain that I would miss my flight to Brazil. I asked an attendant about the flight I was supposed to take at noon. And she didn't know how to answer me. The flight left after 11:20. I arrived in Munich late. During the flight, several passengers asked about the next flight because they were late and the flight attendants said they did not know. Upon disembarking from the aircraft, an employee informed: Flight to Rio, gate L7: run! It was then that I found out that there were 10 more people to board flight LH 500. After customer service, my flight that was supposed to be on the 7th of February and because of the company's fault I couldn't board, I was relocated, along with my cat, to a flight on the 9th of February. .I was referred to a hotel for two nights, Moxy Munich Airport. I was informed that the company would give me a voucher for 18 euros for the two days of stay. And that I would have breakfast included. But that for the 7th and 8th of February, I would only have 18 euros for my meals, that is, 9 euros per day! I ask Lufthansa to analyze my request for compensation, which was informed to me at the time of booking my hotel in Munich by the customer service representative, since I missed the flight to Brazil due to the company's fault, reimbursement of food expenses I had at the hotel, as a voucher of 9 euros per day did not allow me to have 2 meals a day and change of my flight from Munich to Frankfurt at no cost, as we already know that it will be impossible for me to arrive in Munich at 1 pm and leave for Frankfurt at 14:00. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Bologna to Amman via Frankfurt,Feb-23,1,3,1,1,1,3,1,no,1,"  I booked and paid for an extra leg room seat but the seat was standard and the feedback received from Lufthansa after my complaint is this ridiculous message ""Thank you for your inquiry, which we have already forwarded to our processing support, quoting the reference number. We understand that due to the ever increasing number of travel for personal and business reasons, we are unable at this time to offer you the first class service you expect from us. Please understand that response times are currently longer due to the exceptionally high volume of incoming emails."""
✅ Trip Verified ,A319,Business,Premium Economy,Warsaw to Munich,Feb-23,4,5,,,,5,5,yes,10," Flight on time, boarding time perfect. Plane old but in good condition. In all a very good experience and very nice timing of entry into the plane that made for a very nice boarding."
✅ Trip Verified ,E-195,Business,Economy Class,Turin to Munich,Feb-23,5,2,,,,3,4,yes,7,  First time in Lufthansa  and unfortunately it was late. Not much but not used to it. The flight attendant seemed like were not there and the only interaction I had was to remove my jacket from my lap? That was also a first. Plane old but in good condition. 
✅ Trip Verified ,A319,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Warsaw,Feb-23,3,5,5,,,3,3,yes,6,"  A big disappointment with the 1 hour delay in delivering the baggage that made me lose my rental car, no explanation and all closed. The good part was the flight attendant that were spectacular and very friendly Kudos to them. Plane very old. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Houston via Frankfurt,Feb-23,4,5,2,4,2,3,4,yes,7,"  I would just like to thank S Furtmeier, she went above and beyond to make me feel very cared for and special. I did not have a good previous experience on this airline, but she has changed my mind. I will look forward to flying with Lufthansa again due to her service."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Business,Business Class,München to Newark,Jan-23,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa's service has been constantly deteriorating. Food in business class is an insult, cabin service is mediocre and frequent flyers are treated like kettle. The business seats are uncomfortable in comparison with premium airlines. They now seem to pursue a policy of not crediting frequent flyer miles unless you complain. I've been credited 2 out of 7 flight segments with Lufthansa this year - among them only the return flight from New York."
✅ Trip Verified ,E190 / Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bristol to Singapore via Frankfurt,Feb-23,4,4,3,3,2,4,4,yes,8,"  I flew Lufthansa Regional from Bristol to Frankfurt and then Lufthansa onward to Singapore. Prior to travelling, I was worried after having read all the terrible reviews, but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. The shorter flight was perhaps a third full and the flight attendants were polite and professional. They gave us water and a little chocolate. which I thought fine for the flight time of 1h30. Boarding in Bristol is by walking to the plane, and disembarking by bus in Frankfurt, both seemed well organised and with no delays. Upon arrival, the walk through Frankfurt Airport from the bus gates to the Z gates was well-signed and with no need to go through security again. The flight between Frankfurt and Singapore was delayed by an hour. Being a 747 on a busy route, the flight was full but boarding was quite fast with their automatic gates. The seats in economy are smallish but fine for anyone under 6ft. The flight attendants were again polite, professional and had ready smiles. The IFE system had a wide choice of films but was somewhat slow to use, and the Wifi wasn't working on this flight. There was a choice of supper (vegetarian pasta or chicken teriyaki) along with wine, beer or soft drinks. Unlike Singapore Airlines, the crew didn't walk around with drink trays in the middle of the night, so the next meal/drink was a breakfast (cheese and sundried tomato sandwich, yoghurt and the little chocolate). All in all, Lufthansa got me from A to C (through B) in a relatively pleasant manner. It's not 5* like Singapore Airlines, but I would rate this trip was a generally positive 4*."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340,Business,First Class,Munich to Miami,Jan-23,4,5,4,4,,5,4,yes,8," Boarding started with some 20 minutes delay, then it started to snow in Munich and after boarding was completed the plane had to queue for de icing causing a delay of some 2 hours. Very personal and friendly welcoming on board. The First cabin was full - 8 people. Lufthansa should streamline the quality of Champagne - one month they serve a brand retail price at 300€ and the next a brand of 200€ there was no rosé Champagne. Appetisers including caviar were very good however I find beef cheeks not up to First, neither a river fish ""pike"". The German white wines were very good, but the red Ch Batailley is served on another company in business. Very good cheese service and desserts The service was exceptionally good by 2 friendly ladies. Design pyjama by Van Laack and a good amenity kid were also adding value. It was a smooth flight and First passengers did receive special assistance by a friendly lady at the airport for immigration and luggage pick up. It was very good however not the overwhelming ""wow"" effect that receive by some Asian and Mid Eastern companies."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Sofia via Munich,Dec-22,1,3,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," The absolute worst customer service and airline. Years ago Lufthansa had an exceptional standard and quality of service, guess what-not anymore. I don't know what changed but they are the worst. The employees are super rude and the don't give care for resolving your problem. The cabin crew was polite. I travelled from Boston to Sofia, Bulgaria via Munich. My first flight got delayed and I missed the connecting flight. All of this was Lufthansa's fault not mine. I had to stay at Munich airport for 4 hours straight in a line for the customer service desk so I can be rebooked. The people at the line were crying because we all have different final destinations, no one seemed to care. I was with my dog (Pomeranian) that travelled with me in the cabin. I tried to explain that because there is not a pet relief area I can't stay for hours and hours at the line - they didn't care. There were people with small children that explained the same thing - they didn't care. Finally after a horrific wait I was booked on another flight to Frankfurt and from there I had to go to Sofia. Surprise! The flight was delayed again. I was left with 10 minutes to board the other flight. I ran through the airport because they didn't offer transportation to the gate even though all the delays are their fault, and let me tell you that there were no severe weather conditions or any complications of that sort. Their disorganization and lack of communication led to this absolutely awful journey. Years back I travelled with Lufthansa and I can tell that they had top performance. Finally, after all I tried to email them for a partial refund because of all the issues they caused and they denied it. In conclusion, don't travel with them it is not worth your money and your time."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Munich,Jan-23,3,2,1,,,5,1,yes,3," An A320 plane on good condition, departed on time. There was no IFE unless you had pre-loaded LH application. There was no inflight service, than a bottle of water and a small chocolate. Buy Menu available. You could not change your seat at e-check-in, unless you pay for it. I cannot see the difference with low cost companies. On LH you pay more but you get lowco treatment."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Mumbai via Munich,Dec-22,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  My flight from Newark to Munich was delayed by 1 hour 10 minutes and we miss the connecting flight.  We had to take Emirates from Munich to Dubai. The seats allocated in Emirates were separate for me any my wife and the amount that we paid for Seats is not refunded till date despite multiple follow ups. After 4 hours of layover at Dubai, we travelled by Air India from Dubai to Mumbai. The additional handbag that was complimentary by Lufthansa at Newark was not complimentary anymore by Air India at Dubai. We were asked to pay $200 for 6 Kilogram handbag, which we paid. Lufthansa is not at all bothered to reply to your grievances."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Leipzig to San Diego ,Dec-22,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Round trip LEJ-SAN-LEJ booked 5 months in advance. One of our outbound flights was canceled at short notice and we were automatically rebooked. All sections with delay. Luggage came after 2 days. To top it all off, our return flight was reimbursed 2 days in advance for no reason, even though we didn't apply. Incidentally, the credit to our account is still missing today. To get home we had to buy a new flight which was 5 times more expensive. After 4 weeks no response to our letters and mails, no compensation, no responsibility. If a company works so bad, one has to ask is it still safe to fly with them?"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Frankfurt,Jan-23,3,3,2,1,1,4,4,no,3," The inflight entertainment screen was very old with an old touch screen which was very difficult and temperamental - it reminded me of the first entertainment screens on planes in the 90s - these urgently need to be upgraded on this 787-9 as are verging on being unusable and it takes a very long time to find what you are looking for because the touch gestures don’t work half the time / work at the wrong time and you have to go back. Very frustrating. It was a 12 hour flight - we were given a main meal which was fine and then a sandwich and yoghurt before we landed - given the length of the flight, I would have expected two proper meals to be included. Staff were fine but not overly helpful - about the same level of service as on United Airlines or China Southern. Only beer and wine was included - any other alcohol had to be paid for. Legroom in seat was not great - had more legroom on Singapore flight that I took before."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Premium Economy,Newark to Hamburg via Munich,Jan-23,4,4,4,1,,2,3,no,7," I had the privilege to fly Premium Economy on my long haul flight across the Atlantic both ways. For the price, I thought I was pretty happy and it was my key to getting some shut-eye. On the way over, we has a separate cabin and the seats and things were newer. (I think we were on a Boeing) on the way home, we were on an Airbus. It was still good, but not as great as the Boeing version. The food was pretty good and service was average. On my short haul flight, I flew economy, it was tight and cramped. A remodel is needed in the Economy class on all flights. It was outdated. Overall, I would fly this airline again because it was clean and safe, but if you have some extra cash, just fly another."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Istanbul via Frankfurt,Nov-22,4,4,3,,,1,3,no,3,"  Won't be doing that again. Normally I fly with OneWorld but thought I'd try out Lufthansa for this trip as the seats were a reasonable price. Booking was pretty seamless and easy. However it was downhill from there. There is little to no ground service help at the airports. It's mostly outsourced to companies who have little power to actually help you; useless when your flight is cancelled and you can't be rebooked for 3 days. Absolutely appalling lack of communication from on-ground and central customer service, with each customer service agent either not replying at all or contradicting their colleagues. Trying to claim for any kind of compensation has been a nightmare (despite assurance from the ground staff at the time) and I'm not holding out any hope. Many letters, emails and phone calls later, I'm not getting anywhere. Business class with Lufthansa offers you nothing extra in terms of service. Friendly and professional cabin crew though."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Chicago,Jan-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,  The portions of the meals as well as quality of the meals were extremely poor.  10.5 hours of flight and only two snacks and one small lunch with no vegetables or fruits.  The other sandwich was piece of bread with spaghetti sauce in the middle and nothing else. To make the matters worse none of the USB chargers were working and my TV was not working either. There was a message saying that it needs to be replaced. Our kids were hungry and cranky the entire flight. We travel this route several times a year but this was our last time flying with Lufthansa.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Frankfurt,Jan-23,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Without a shadow of a doubt, Lufthansa is the worst airline in the world. I have never experienced a ruder and less helpful customer service team. They cancelled my flight and refuse to communicate with me in relation to a refund and compensation. Every time you speak to an agent they tell you something different."
Not Verified ,A340,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Cape town,Jan-23,1,1,2,2,2,2,1,no,2,"  Shocking airline for long haul flights. Expensive flights in economy and travelled with my wife and 11 month old son. I was originally told that no bassinets or extra seats were available for this route to find out when checking in that there were bassinets available to which could not be booked. Extra seats were also not available to which when boarding the flight, there were seats available. I have never in my life experienced such rude and arrogant cabin crew who were loud and rude to my wife, and  seemed to want to rush everything. Seats on this flight were uncomfortable and no leg room. All in all, this has really out me off travelling with Lufthansa again in the future for long haul. Short haul is a completely different story where I have only ever experienced great service and comfort. Very disappointing Lufthansa to say the least!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Marseille to Dubai via Frankfurt,Jan-23,2,2,3,3,,1,1,no,1,  I spent hours over the phone to know the cost of bringing some sport equipment with me and I was told that it was free. once I arrived at the airport I had to pay 150euros. on top of this I had wrapped my golf set and it arrived damaged but Lufthansa refuses to refund me as they told me I should have told them at the airport that there was a damage. This means I should have unpacked the wrap at the airport and report immediately. Be careful and check your luggage before leaving the airport. I now have a broken golf bag and broken clubs that I will have to throw away.
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Port Harcourt via Frankfurt,Jul-22,1,1,1,1,2,1,2,no,2," They canceled our flight as a result of their one-day strike living a family of six stranded in a foreign country. This could have been prevented if they had taken a little care to inform the traveler to not travel or reschedule. But they don't care. We could all be stranded for all they cared. We were told to foot all bills on hotel, food, and transportation back and for the airport that they will reimburse/compensate. Since then till now we have been going back and forth. Now they made an offer and we accepted then they came back to say it was an error figure they made another offer cutting the initial offer by six and I'm wondering why. By the way, our eight pieces of luggage never arrived on the same day, which was more inconvenient for us. Wearing the clothes for how many days and our medications were in the luggage. How can they not be sensitive or care about what travelers had to go through especially with kids? it has taken five months to even respond to the offer they are withdrawing from."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Munich,Dec-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Flight LHR-MUC cancelled due to weather - freezing rain, in Munich. Other airlines were operating in MUC. Staff in Lufthansa lounge at LHR is not trained to rebook. They tell their premium customers to go down to 1st floor and get in line of more than 200 people and one booking agent. Wifi in LH lounge not working but lounge manager gave me a code of Air Lingus lounge. Clearly an ongoing issue. Suitcase lost at LHR for over 2 weeks. Chaotic messages about suitcase status via their tracking website and cell phones messages. 2 different non integrated systems. Outsourced customer service in Asia with terrible waiting times and minimal competence. No compensation for articles of premier necessity for suitcase lost for over 2 weeks."
Not Verified ,A340-313,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Frankfurt,Jan-23,3,3,2,2,,3,3,no,6,"  Flight LH797 was scheduled to be a Boeing 747-8 so was disappointed to see that had changed. Cabin and crew were fine although seemed to vanish once the meal service had been completed. My main issue was the lack of additional snacks during the flight, bearing in mind it was 14 hours 20 minutes long with only 1 meal and 1 snack service offered. My outbound legs were with a different airline (rebooked as LH cancelled my original full sector so missed connecting with the outbound sector of this flight) and on both sectors (6.5 and 8.5 hours long) 2 hot meal services were provided. Inflight entertainment system was ok but had difficulty hearing any of the programs offered and the headsets were uncomfortable"
Not Verified ,A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Manchester,Feb-22,2,5,,,,2,3,yes,7,"  Regrettably the boarding staff were very rude (I've discussed this in my review about Frankfurt airport). Short haul flight with the worst seat pitch ever; we were sat very near the back, which made for a very slow exit on arrival. More like a low-cost airline as you get nothing for free. However, the cabin crew were lovely and we arrived on time"
Not Verified ,A340-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Frankfurt,Feb-22,4,5,3,3,,3,4,yes,8,"  The second leg of our journey to Europe from NZ was via Lufthansa. We booked our flights based on price more than anything else, so we weren't expecting a great deal. Boarding was straightforward and not delayed. The A340 had a 2-4-2 configuration, and one of the crew had whispered to me ""the flight is empty, once we say boarding completed, grab yourself a row for sleeping""; unfortunately, the couple in front of me decided they would have a row each, so my wife and I had to settle for a pair of seats each. Compared to the Singapore A350, the Lufthansa plane was showing its age, though it was fairly clean and tidy, but the toilets in particular had seen better days. We were served dinner soon after departure, which was a hot meal, there wasn't anything else on offer, and anything between that and breakfast had to be purchased, which I did not expect from a full service carrier. That said, one of the cabin crew pointed this out and suggested I may need more than one beer for the 14 hour flight, so placed 2 spares in my seat pocket. The inflight entertainment system was OK, though the range wasn't as good as others, particularly on the music channels. Breakfast was very odd; it was a very large cheese roll - more like lunch than breakfast, with a thick lump of cheese and no pickle. Flight wise, this was the smoothest trip I have ever been on, and the landing was buttery smooth; it was though a culture shock when the aircraft parked a long distance from the terminal and we disembarked on to a bus - 70 passengers on an A340 all bunged on a single bus!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Munich,Dec-22,1,3,2,2,1,1,1,no,1,"  I would never travel Lufthansa again! For no reason, they kept me at their counter for 1 hour 20 minutes, asking me questions for no reason, when this had never happened to me anywhere. They questioned me and asked me to show them evidence of where I had traveled and where I was going to travel. They asked me for identification in addition to my passport, credit cards, in short, an extensive history, it's ridiculous! Besides, we traveled 6 hours in the worst seats I've ever traveled on an airplane, the plane looked spacious and good, but the seats are very uncomfortable! And to close with a flourish they broke my entire suitcase! "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Cape Town to London via Frankfurt,Dec-22,2,2,3,2,1,1,1,no,1," The worst experience. I booked directly with them, I had numerous changes, cancellations. 2 minutes before announcing our gate I received a message that our flight was cancelled. I called customer service in the UK and was given a flight 2 days later with BA. I still had to go and check out at the counter so I get my new flight confirmation. No guidance and no staff to help anywhere. We were like a sheep all wandering around. They had 2 people working there for numerous airlines. One said first class and business and the other was economy, I stood next to the business window. I was told to go back to the end of the line. After we finally landed in Cape Town 2.5 days late to our celebrations. I noticed that our flights back were cancelled again. I managed to rebook but after that checked every day to make sure we still had the flights to go back. Stressful and unnecessary! The flight back was on time and the older lady (she was the only one in business class that was pleasant!). The guys were extremely rude and one of them was more interested looking and playing with his moustache than providing service. The short flight from Frankfurt was pleasant and the staff lovely. So to summarise this. The worst experience ever, rude and unpleasant staff (with exception to 3 ladies on 2 flights) unorganised, lacking communication, no clear guidance. I will never ever use them again!"
Not Verified ,A320,Business,Business Class,Glasgow to Frankfurt,Dec-22,2,5,3,,,1,4,yes,7,"  Turned up 3hrs before departure time. Joined the business check in queue, There were 4 people in the queue, The two passengers at the counter had reservation issues and it took approx 45 mins to sort it. Meantime we waited, and waited and waited. Most of the economy queue had checked in by the time we did, Fast track security, which made very little difference. LH use the upper deck lounge for business passengers, I definitely wouldn't pay for it. Grumpy, unwelcoming, miserable looking staff. Male toilet out of order. 10.15am I was told that I couldn't have a croissant as breakfast was over. Once on board the aircraft your seat is an economy seat with the centre one blocked off. No different to BA. The cabin did look a bit tired and used, Cabin Crew were lovely and the catering was of decent quality if a bit miserable. On the return trip the crew were exceptionally nice especially the Purser. You could tell that this lady enjoyed her work. I was impressed with her friendliness and attentiveness. Drama in Glasgow though when my luggage wasn't on the belt. Menzies aviation didn't seem to care. They didn't even give me a lost luggage ref number and also did not put my contact details onto the computer. They have done everything possible to prevent you from phoning them. A call to LH the next morning got thigs sorted. Menzies received my luggage on the morning of the 3rd Jan and didn't deliver it until the afternoon of the 4th. Despite RUSH/SAME DAY DELIVERY being labelled all over the cases. I live 30 mins from the airport. Most of the problems were most likely very little to do with LH but they're the ones taking the money. Onboard the aircraft the crew did make up for any of the airport shortcomings."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Birmingham to Singapore via Frankfurt ,Jun-22,2,3,2,3,,5,1,no,1," Appalling service!! Booked business class return flights with Lufthansa to Auckland NZ from Birmingham via Frankfurt/Singapore. A week later two of the return flights were cancelled. Re-booked returned flights from Auckland. A week before departure I downloaded Lufthansa App to phone to find out that two of the return flights were not on my itinerary any more, so obviously had been cancelled by Lufthansa. No email or message received to notify me of this. Then had to rebook two return flights at over double the cost of original. I've complained to Lufthansa in August. Have since send reminders and still no response to my email in regard to the cancelled flights. Would never use again. Above wasn't the only issue! Only gave 1 out of 10, as yon cant give Zero"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Incheon to Munich,Dec-22,1,1,3,4,1,3,2,no,5," My flight date was 15th Dec from Seoul to Munich and flight number LH719 On 14th Dec around 11pm I got a message saying your flight has been cancelled. After that no further information was given to me. I tried to reach customer care in South Korea but no customer care service available in the night. Then tried to reach Germany customer care, after holding the line for 1 hour able to talk to the customer care asked them to rebook my flight. But they booked the flight for 16th Dec instead of 15th Dec which I never told them to do. Then I had to call them again for rebooking, and another 1hr of holding time. Then customer care said they will book the Singapore Airlines via Singapore. Again I waited for the confirmation mail or message from Lufthansa or Singapore airlines, but none came that night. Again I called to customer care and able to reach them after another hour of struggle. They said it's booked but not confirmed from Singapore Airlines, so you need to wait. By this time its already 4am. So this difficulties can be avoided if Lufthansa provided me the rebooking options in the app or via email then I could have select the alternative flight for my trip. It will be very easy but no, they didn't provide anything. And no apologies mails or msg from their side as well. Very bad airline in terms of customer services for me."
✅ Trip Verified ,Canadair Jet 900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Milan Linate to Frankfurt,Jan-23,2,1,,,,1,1,no,3,  Again an uneventful low cost experience on this full service airline. A complete waste of money for what one gets. Better to take a no-frills airline (which gives exactly the same onboard service as Lufthansa’s Europe in Economy). The benefit is you spend less and you do not feel fooled.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Muscat via Munich,Dec-22,3,4,,,,1,2,no,3,"  Flight was delayed from LHR. No information for connecting flight at Munich airport. 1 hour transit time reduced to 30 minutes - horrible airport experience with no Guidance at Munich. They lost my bag which was did not arrive on 16th Dec in Oman. Day 18 of Lost Bag on 01st Jan 2023.  I bought the ticket from their website no discount or changes from my end. Please avoid this airline and MUC airport. 18 days and my bag with family gifts for Xmas and other essentials is nowhere in site. LH tells me to ask the connecting flight operator Oman air, but my bag is in LH custody which they have not released to Oman Air! LH ground staff at LHR needs more training as well. A learning experience for me."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Krakow to Nurnberg via Frankfurt,Dec-22,2,3,1,,,2,4,no,1,  Our flight was on 21th December from Krakow to Nurnberg through Frankfurt and they lost our baggage. At Nurnberg on 24th December we found one of the baggage but the other one was still missing. So we had to travel to Izmir and wait there for the other baggage. As we informed from Lufthansa site (where we can check the situation of the baggage with the reference number) they found also the other baggage and it flew on 27th December from Nurnberg to Frankfurt and then from Frankfurt to Izmir. On 27th it should be at Izmir's aiprort. We went to the Izmir's airport but they didn't help us from Lufthansa and told us that there is no information about the baggage and they will call us. Also they told that we had to ask also to Sun express company. Still waiting.
✅ Trip Verified ,Canadair Jet,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Milan Linate,Dec-22,2,5,2,,,4,1,no,5,"  Short hop to Milan, not even 60 min flight. Upgraded from eco light Tarif to business class with a voucher being Senator Star Alliance Gold, which frankly speaking was easy. Wasn’t expecting much, and got 100% confirmed, besides the kindness of the cabin crew. The rest was miserable as expected and I wonder how long Lufthansa‘s management thinks they can get away with it. Piece of cake on a plate with a whip of cream and that was it. Luckily they had a glass of white wine, to make something out of it."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Madrid,Dec-22,3,3,,,,1,1,no,1," The most horrible travel experience of my life. Took a codeshare (originally booked under Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Madrid with a stopover in Frankfurt) and the Frankfurt to Madrid journey was operated by Lufthansa. After a 12.5 hour journey from Singapore to Frankfurt, I arrived to Frankfurt only to get a message from Lufthansa saying my flight was cancelled. No other explanation or information given. Staff directed me to the Lufthansa service Center still refusing to give an explanation. There were over 120 people waiting in the line before me, all of whom had their flights delayed or cancelled from different countries. I waited over 4 hours in that line from 6pm to 10pm. When I finally got to the front, they told me the next flight to Madrid was the following day morning and was even put on the waitlist of that flight because it was so full. I was stuck in Frankfurt (-4deg Celsius) for the night with no additional clothes or my coat because they would not release my luggage. The next day by some luck, I got on the flight to Madrid which was at 10.15am. Due to delays, the flight left at 1pm. When I reached out to the Lufthansa for some sort of compensation for my troubles (I had missed a train in Madrid due to this) and frankly exhausting experience, the only compensation they gave was “we’re sorry”. I am absolutely put off and disgusted with the service & Lufthansa is one airline I will never fly with again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Munich,Dec-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  We were 2 hours delayed leaving Manchester and when we finally arrived in Munich they had no staff to unload luggage from the plane so we had to sit for 4 hours on the floor in the baggage area waiting with a small baby. Finally we got our suitcase, the baby's pram didn't arrive as they had forgotten to put it on the plane in Manchester. After 4 days it was delivered to our house - broken. We asked for some compensation but Lufthansa refused to pay anything. I guess they feel they did nothing wrong!"
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Oslo to Phuket via Münich,Dec-22,1,4,1,2,1,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa did nothing right. Flew from Norway to Thailand and on the way there our flight was delayed, so we lost our transfer flight in Münich. We had to stay there 24h to wait for our next flight. The costumer service was also really bad, they were rude. On the way back we were checking in our baggage to go home, and they couldn't find our flight. Lufthansa had cancelled our whole trip and didn't notify us. Worst traveling experience. Would not recommend. Only good thing was that cabin staff were nice."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Bangalore via Frankfurt,Dec-22,3,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  The queue management at Frankfurt airport is pathetic. There was a long queue for Indian passengers just for passport verification, 2 hours before the flight. Then another queue for boarding. Once I reached the end of queue, I was informed that the queue was for disabled passenger and asked me to go back to end of queue. After some time they informed me that the queue is for family with children, elderly. We were given middle seats in different areas of the plane.  I requested but no cooperation for Airhostess. My food was not fresh and not tasty. We requested Vegetarian food, but were not given Veg food."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Bangalore to Toronto via Frankfurt,Dec-22,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," I booked Lufthansa for my Toronto trip, my 2nd flight was changed to Eurowings which is operated by Lufthansa I did not get food in the flight, they said only ""Beef"" is the only option but I am a vegetarian I requested them and they rudely said ""only beef is available"" as they ran out all veg and they end up giving just a bun and butter for my entire 9hr duration flight. They were charging money for even basic things like air pods"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,San Francisco to Trieste via Frankfurt,Jun-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," I used to love this airline and fly LH all the time. What's happened to you, Lufthansa?? The most horrendous customer service, full of misleading information, and no result, in over 6 months! Needed to rebook parents' flights due to my father's medical emergency back in June... called a zillion times, phones constantly disconnecting, three times spoke to a different rep who rebooked for me, three times supposedly booking was confirmed, but then the booking code disappeared from the LH website... I'm beyond appalled!!! What a scam this airline has become!! I kept calling 1800 645 3880, the USA phone number. For weeks, even months, the voice message would say that the lines were busy and to call later. I finally got my call answered in November. I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. I tried the second time. The second rep assisted, I explained the whole situation, and got disconnected. Five times in a row! This cannot be normal. At one point, I asked the rep whether they were having issues with phones, and she responded yes, but they are being worked on. But I called on other days, too, and it was the same. I got disconnected every time I got a rep on the phone. Is this a tactic by Lufthansa to keep customers away? Basically you can't get anything solved, since you get disconnected every time!! And I repeat, EVERY TIME!!! Over a span of two weeks, I called the US phone number about 10 times, and got disconnected every time, after I explained to the rep what I needed. So I called the German phone number +49 - 69 - 86 799 799, on December 5, 2022. The rep reviewed the files and offered to rebook my parents' tickets. We spend over an hour on the phone (and got a message from AT&T phone company that I just got charged $200 for the long distance call). The rep gives me a new booking code. She took my credit card number and said I would be charged $41.23 for tax, and $150 for rebooking, for either of my parents. I agreed to these terms. The rep gave me the new booking code. I checked on the website, and the code was on the LH booking site. Two days later I checked again, and the code was no longer there. I called +49 - 69 - 86 799 799 again. Asked a different rep why the code disappeared from the LH website. The rep checked, and said it was because those flights were no longer available (nobody let me know that! Imagine my parents going to the airport on the day of, and find no seats on the plane!). She offered to rebook to ‘available’ dates. Took my credit card information, told me that I would be charged $41.27 for either parent, the booking code would stay the same, and now we’re supposedly confirmed. I received an email from Lufthansa with confirmation. However, the email also said to “Please call back your Lufthansa Service Center”. I smelled a problem again! I called Lufthansa, spoke to a rep, who checked the booking, and she assured me that everything was in order. I also checked the website, and the booking showed. Two days later, IT DISAPPEARED AGAIN! I tried for the last time, on December 21, 2022. The LH rep said that the previous booking didn’t go for ticketing (no explanation provided!). I said this would be my last time attempting to rebook the two flights."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Sofia via Frankfurt,Dec-22,3,1,1,2,1,1,1,no,1,"  As a customer I have never been treated with such disregard as I have by Lufthansa and their Baggage service. I have been on the phone 20+hours over the last two weeks trying to get a resolution to our missing baggage. We have Apple Air Tags on our bags and have informed them every time of their location. Every time I call I get the same response, the bags made a trip from Munich to Sofia and that's the last it was updated. Every time I tell them the baggages never left Munich and say ""yes the flight was cancelled"" and day they will update the system but I still get the same response every time. We were asked to submit an inventory list to help locate the baggage because apparently GPS trackers aren't relevant enough, and it's been 3 days without a response. This was our first trip for our adoption and the travel was the worst experience either of us has ever had."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Tunis,Dec-22,2,1,1,,1,1,1,no,1,"  Our flight had a 1 hour delay, which was OK, considering the weather. The captain announced that passengers were free to send messages by the internal Wi-Fi, which was a good attention too. Then things started to get nasty. Late night food was mediocre at best, the omelette was without taste and rock solid. After landing in Tunis at 1:30AM and waiting for the luggage at the delivery, we were informed that ""No luggage has not been embarked in Frankfurt"" ""make the queue to register for lost luggage"". Waited 1 hour in the queue, just to be told that the registration can be made online. No Lufthansa personel on site for any explanation. I was surprised by the lack of sincerity from Lufthansa, the plane captain and crew, since they must have known the missing luggage before the departure but failed to share the information to the passengers.  If I was able to make the online registration in the plane, I could have left immediately the airport! Set aside the general difficulty around the increased air traffic, the lack of sincerity and transparency at Lufthansa has been a real shock; I will have no option but to consider alternatives. After 2 days, our luggages are still missing"
Not Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Munich,Dec-22,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  The worst customer service I have ever experienced. Started when our flight was cancelled due to bad weather. The customer service desk at Heathrow T2 had a long line which was expected but after standing in line for 20 minutes all the customer service staff finished their shift, left the desk whilst a 50m long queue of people were waiting. After 2hrs no one had returned back to the desk to serve the customers. After someone asked we were sent to another customer service desk where again the lady behind the counter finished her shift without being replaced leaving customers again standing in queue with no one to help them. On arrival into Munich the following day (we had to pay for our own accomodation in London) 3 of our bags did not arrive. We placed a lost baggage claim at Munich airport but 4 days later we still do not have the luggage back or even an estimated date. I have made several phone calls trying to chase up where our baggage is (snowboard equipment so we have to hire equipment costing us approximately $2000 AUD) and no representative from Lufthansa is willing to assist us in prioritising our baggage to be located. One baggage service representative even hung up on me!! So now we are 4 days without our brand new snowboards, $2500 AUD out of pocket and dismayed and disgusted that an airline can show such absolute disdain to iits passengers! "
✅ Trip Verified ,A220,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Manchester,Dec-22,2,5,3,,,3,4,yes,8," As with all European Business Class offerings, the seat is nothing special. An economy seat where the middle seat of the three is left empty as a shared space with the other passenger. Lufthansa does offer a meal depending on the time of day it may be hot(ish) or cold. One nice touch is that on many routes a small bar of chocolate and an apple are offered after the meal. Our flight was a little late departing which was frustrating but understandable as the sub-zero temperatures across Europe were causing delays everywhere. Indeed our flight from Budapest had been so late that we only just made this connection. The cabin crew were excellent and the service brisk and professional. All three of our Lufthansa flights this month were excellent when rating the service."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hannover to Budapest via Munich ,Dec-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Flew, (or at least tried to) with Lufthansa to Budapest. First flight was delayed 2 hours in advance, automatically rebooked to a flight on the same day, 5 hours later. This flight was then delayed two times, half an hour before scheduled departure time with a total of 4 more hours. Missed the connecting flight, and of course the ""help desk"" cannot do anything and a refund or compensation is pure myth."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Florence via Frankfurt,Sep-22,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,no,1," Terrible! Initial flight out was delayed and we would miss our connecting flight so they crammed us onto another flight which also got in late. I had originally paid extra to pick our seats so that was a loss. The entertainment system on the plane was not working so that was also a bust. We arrived so late that we missed our private transport. The return flight was worse and never actually happened!! After waiting at the Florence airport for 7 hours, Lufthansa cancelled our flight out and claimed weather (not sure how it could have been weather since another flight going to the same place, Frankfurt, was allowed to take off). We were now stranded with no one to help us. We were told to go to the customer service desk where we initially checked in for the flight. The rep recommended that we travel to another airport and book a flight out on a different carrier. We did this at great expense to us. We have since asked Lufthansa to reimburse us for the Lufthansa flight that we never took because it was cancelled by Lufthansa. They refused. I never want to fly this airline again. There were cheaper flights available but I chose Lufthansa based upon their rating. What a joke! I flew home on Delta and had a wonderful experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Economy Class,Milano Malpensa to Frankfurt,Dec-22,4,5,5,,,4,3,yes,10,"  Lufthansa took me from point A to point B, safely and on time. The flight lasted under two hours, and I was surprised that in economy they still gave us bottled water and a little chocolate. The 25 year old plane was very well-kept.  I paid a little bit extra to sit on the 2 seat emergency aisle, and I lucked out because I had no one next to me. If you are a frequent flyer like me I don’t understand what all the negative comments about Lufthansa are all about. They do a fantastic job!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Chicago,Dec-22,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I have been at Frankfurt airport after traveling on an early morning flight out of Amman which left at 340am their time. I have been up for over 36 hours at this point and my flight has been delayed multiple times. It was originally supposed to leave at 1040 am and now we are looking at 600pm. We are going to Chicago, and from there have a flight to Charlotte, NC before driving 3.5 hours home. This is on top of being told we will be provided a “meal” but being given only trail mix, some kind of chocolate cookie bar, water and juice. We were also loaded onto shuttle buses that had very few seats, we were packed in like sardines, and taken to the tarmac to board a new flight. We watched them load our luggage while we sat stationary on the tarmac with no explanation. Then they started unloading the luggage back off the plane and we began receiving texts that our flight was delayed again until 4pm them immediately received another text stating it was delayed until 6pm. My partner as significant rheumatological health problems and did not have access to a seat, which is a problem for her, and was in tears from standing stationary on a flat hard surface for so long. There was poor air circulation on the shuttle and the close proximity of everyone packed onto the shuttle quickly made it become suffocatingly hot.  We waited approximately 45 minutes on the shuttle in front of the plane before being told, with zero explanation, that we were being taken back to the gate we had just left.  We were then told that our gate was moved from z54 to B23, which is quiet the hike in the airport. This is on top of sleep deprivation and zero real food. I began researching Lufthansa customer rights and found that we are supposed to be provided with a meal voucher to be used at participating restaurants within the airport and that it is built into the bar code of the boarding pass. When we went to use it, the lady at the restaurant said it was something they honor and use but when she scanned the code, she said it hadn’t been activated by the airline yet. When we came back to the counter to see about having it activated, we were told they couldn’t activate it and a manager had to. It is now 408pm local time.  I understand that delays happen but the overall lack of communication and lack of customer service has been appalling. I have never seen this level of lack of caring for the clientele paying for services by a company."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Krakow to Munich,Nov-22,4,5,,,,5,5,yes,10," I had a pain attack while flying from Krakow to Munich, and even when I thought I could control it, it was not the case and I had to ask for help. I want to take time here to recognize the excellent job of the cabin crew on the flight, which not only took care of me and provided me with as much comfort as possible but also coordinated everything to make my way to the hospital fast and easy. Luckily I got on time to the hospital and they could treat my issue before it scaled to a more severe situation. Thank you, I am grateful about your very human and empathetic approach and for sure will continue flying with you."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Rome to Munich,Nov-22,1,5,,1,1,1,2,no,1,"  I’ve flown with them three times in the last year and each time they’ve managed to have a baggage delay. The app and website are slow and unreliable and simple things like changing seats require calling their phone center. Business class has old uncomfortable seats, no power outlets, and no wifi."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 748,Business,Business Class,Johannesburg to Frankfurt,Nov-22,1,5,3,4,,4,2,yes,7,"  Crew are great, not over the top, they just get the balance right. What lets them down are the dreadful business class seats. Seriously LH this is 2022, 4 across on the upper deck is no longer acceptable. Wine list made up for the dreadful seats."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Mumbai via Frankfurt,Nov-22,4,1,1,3,,2,2,no,4,"  The cabin crew staff were rude and arrogant to me. If you are sleeping, then you won't get water or food even if you ask multiple times. I pressed the button and was waiting for 20 mins for a glass of water.  I have traveled a lot but the experience with Lufthansa is painful. I don't think they really have any concerns and if customer experience really matters to them."
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Rome to Brussels via Frankfurt,Nov-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1, Horrible experience. Delays. Lost luggage. Rude steward. No carry on baggage compartments due to stuffed jackets from others. When asked for compartment help the steward replied too bad. Very bad attitude. Will not fly Lufthansa again
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Madrid,Nov-22,2,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  I felt compelled to write this, even though nothing I am going to describe in my recent travel experience hasn't already been written by others. The only thing I can add is that I am shocked that the Department of Transport in the U.S. and the FAA continue to allow Lufthansa to operate with impunity. I have flown Lufthansa for decades, (because I primarily fly on United, and being the Star Alliance partner, inevitably I would be on Lufthansa in the European portion). This month was the first time I traveled outside of the U.S. since the pandemic. I had heard that Lufthansa has completely fallen off the cliff in terms of service, reliability and even general operational adequacy, but I thought, a short 2 hr flight RT between Frankfurt and Madrid, how bad can that get? Their seats booking system is broken, and while we had paid for premium seats over and over again (and promised previous overcharged payments would be refunded, I don't expect to see that refund), we essentially had no premium seat assignments up to the day of departure. Their ground crew was rude and hostile, (e.g. just did not answer my questions, rolled their eyes and smirked with agents next to them, etc.), and the flight crew basically was not present throughout the flight. No service whatsoever on the flight (no snacks, no drinks, I didn't know this is a discount budget airline?). Mobile boarding pass could not be issued at time of check in, I had to line up at airport, at which point, the agent harassed me by insisting on weighing my carryon (they did not insist on doing that for my husband who is White), and said my carryon was 1 kg over, so I had to check it. At least, my luggage did not get lost. I was horrified by the experience. I sent many letters of complaints to the company, I do not expect anyone to respond or compensate."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo Haneda to Munich,Nov-22,4,4,3,5,,5,4,yes,8,"  The flight experience was very good, far better than expected. Crew friendly, flight on time, food okay if not a little poor, self service of drinks in the galley, movie selection/ entertainment system good: a smooth flight, on par with ANA, which I had flow on the leg Frankfurt-Haneda."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Nice,Sep-22,1,1,1,2,,2,1,no,1," We use to love Lufthansa but now it has become the worst airline both on-board and with the worst customer service. No one is ever there to address issues, if they are there they are rude. You can’t talk to a live support. No response to email inquiries. They owe me 250 euros but have not yet reimbursed me. Flight cancellations, delays are very common with no explanation or support. Terrible food on board on international flights. Avoid Lufthansa at any cost."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bologna to Munich,Jun-22,2,2,,,,2,1,no,1,"  They won't send me the money they owe me for something that was their fault. In June 2022 their flight from Bologna to Munich was late and caused me to miss the connection to Toronto. I waited in line for 5 hours and was told they ran out of vouchers and would happily reimburse my overnight expenses which amounted to about $300. I'm a college student and could barely afford to cover that, so I've really needed my money back. But after I went through the email-only customer service process, after 2 months the rep asked for my bank information to send me the money - I responded promptly - and never got the money, almost 4 months later. I sent multiple follow up emails and nobody will respond. There's basically no way to contact them otherwise. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,BOG to FRA,Nov-22,3,5,4,4,,4,4,yes,8,  Nice Flight on time in Business through a mileage upgrade. Cabin crew very nice and attending. Food was quite decent three course Menu and breakfast even though the flight was a late night one. Seats are a bit dated. Yes it’s a full flat bed but seat had some male function and needed to be reset. Also the head part is annoying when sleeping. But all in all a good experience.
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Tunis via Frankfurt,Nov-22,1,3,1,1,1,1,2,no,2,"  You get what you pay for. Lufthansa crew are always on point, if a little dull, but the business class product is embarrassing. Chaos at the gates, nasty ground staff, no sense of feeling like this could be a fun trip. The food onboard is poor with a single selection, no charging points, no amenities, no pillow or blanket on a late night flight, no entertainment, no recognition of Miles and More status. Just sub-par on every count except price. Well done for making a cheap product feel really cheap."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to Vancouver,Nov-22,3,3,3,2,,3,2,no,5,"  We paid for premium economy for the transatlantic flight. Weeks before our departure, we paid for seat reservation as we want to ensure we are seated together and have the window/aisle, 2 seats only - so not to sit beside a fellow passenger). We got an email that our carrier will be changed to Eurowing. 24 hours before our flight I did my on line check in, they moved us to the middle aisle with 3 seater. What is the point of paying for seat reservation, and being moved for no reason at all? This is a rip-off in my opinion, paying already for premium seats, and you need to pay for seat selection! Food from Amman to Frankfurt, Frankfurt to Cairo which is over 4 hours, they gave a stale sandwich. Egypt Air for a short haul flight from Cairo to Jordan, at least provided a cold plate , For the amount of money we paid, it was really not worth it!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Keflavík,Nov-22,1,3,3,,,2,1,no,1,"  Frankfurt to Keflavík, Iceland in Business Class in an A320neo. Lufthansa's Business Class product within Europe is a joke, a glorified Economy Class. The lack of quality is apparent right away during boarding. Priority boarding is virtually non-existent. This time we were herded into a crowded bus and driven to the aircraft on the tarmac. Then the seating - virtually identical to Economy except with a slightly more legroom and the middle seat left unoccupied. Hardly premium. No inflight entertainment nor WiFi on their A320neo aircraft for a flight over over 3 hours. Why does Lufthansa charge Business Class fare only to provide us an Economy Class experience? This is a case of false advertising."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bombay to Frankfurt,Nov-22,2,5,5,3,4,4,4,no,5,"  Bombay to Frankfurt in Business Class in an A340-300. Lufthansa's current fleet to and from Bombay is either the aging A340 or the aging B747-400 aircraft. Both are well past their prime and so is the Business Class seating configuration which is 2-2-2 with no direct aisle access for the passenger by the window. The dated seat design is not in the same class as those offered by rivals such as Qatar, ANA, Singapore Airlines and so on. Where Lufthansa shines is the inflight service which is top notch. The flight attendants are warm and efficient. Currently it is not worth paying for Lufthansa Business Class. The only reason I stick with this airline if the suitability of routing for my needs."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Business Class,Brussels to Barcelona via Frankfurt,Oct-22,2,2,1,,,2,1,no,2, The flight to Frankfurt is short and the service provided in business is a disaster - I cannot describe an apple and muesli with a small bottle of milk as a decent continental breakfast - I was lucky there was some decent breakfast available in the business lounge in Frankfurt the meal served on the flight to Barcelona was also very mediocre - the inflight service on Lufthansa really is declining heavily : extremely small portions of cheap ingredients like boiled beef - and once again my suitcases did not arrive - the ground handling promised a delivery at my hotel in Barcelona at 5 pm unfortunately it was 1 am during the night - I've had it with Lufthansa
Not Verified ,A320-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to London Heathrow,Nov-22,4,3,3,,3,2,3,no,4,  Emails were sent to check hand luggage into the hold due to amount of person’s using hand luggage. However unlike in London on departure to Munich this was not followed up with mandatory removal of hand luggage by staff. This is all free of charge. As the staff did not force passengers to enter baggage into the hold this created an uneasy attitude towards luggage already in place in overhead storage - this created animosity within the plane and aggressive behaviour. There were numerous bags far too big and heavy into the above lockers. I find this level of incompetence astounding as the first journey was nothing like the incompetence we’ve received on return.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Düsseldorf via Munich,Nov-22,3,2,2,3,3,1,2,no,1,"  One of the worst experiences I ever had on this airline. I booked a flight from Mumbai to Düsseldorf via Munich. A few hours before the flight when I try to check in, I see a notification stating that i cannot go ahead with the check in process and need to select an alternative connection. They rebooked my flight without my consent on one of their star alliances partners at a time which was not at all convenient to me. So i had to go from Mumbai to New Delhi and then from New Delhi to Munich and to Düsseldorf instead of the direct flight from Mumbai to Munich and  to Düsseldorf. Moreover, the flight from Mumbai to Delhi was delayed by up to 3 hours and they lost my luggage between Munich and Düsseldorf. I could not reach the customer care as it was a Sunday and it was out of their working hours. I had to call a separate customer service number who hung up on me on the pretext of clarifying the information"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to  Panama,Oct-22,3,4,2,3,,1,2,no,4,"  We booked a flexible Premium Economy ticket with Lufthansa from Paris to Bogotá. About three weeks earlier, Lufthansa announced that the long-haul flight from Frankfurt had been cancelled. So I called the call center and asked that Eurowings Discover flies to Bogotá via Panama City. Confirmation etc. received by email. Hotel canceled in Paris. 4 days later this ticket was canceled again by Lufthansa. Another call to the call center revealed that you have to fly from Paris - no customer service from Lufthansa.  They insisted on Paris, and the reference to the new ticket issued and that Lufthansa had canceled it didn't help. Only the internal instructions at Lufthansa were referred to. Transfer to AG from Paris rejected. Either money back or from Paris. Arrival and hotel organized again and then with two changes to Bogotá. You don't have to say a word more about what is called on European routes at LH Service. Eurowings Discover - yes it works, but all drinks in the Premium Eco are free of charge. Otherwise, customer orientation at Lufthansa is underground - even if they cancel flights themselves. Hands off! Wir haben eine flexibles Premium Economy Ticket mit Lufthansa von Paris nach Bogotá gebucht. Ungefähr drei Wochen vorher teilte Lufthansa mit das der Langstreckenflug ab Frankfurt storniert sei. Also das Callcenter angerufen und angesprochen das man mit Eurowings Discover über Panama-Stadt nach Bogotá fliegt. Bestätigung usw. per Email erhalten. Hotel in Paris storniert. 4 Tag später ist dieses Ticket von Lufthansa wieder storniert worden. Ein weiterer Anruf beim Callcenter ergab das man von Paris fliegen muss - Kundenservice gar keiner seitens Lufthansa. Es wurde auf Paris bestanden, auch der Hinweis auf das ausgestellte neue Ticket und das ja von Lufthansa storniert wurde hat nichts geholfen. Es wurde lediglich auf die internen Anweisungen bei Lufthansa verwiesen. Umbuchung auf AG von Paris abgelehnt. Entweder Geld zurück oder ab Paris. Anreise und Hotel wieder organisiert und dann mit zweimal umsteigen nach Bogotá. Über das was sich auf Europastrecke bei LH Service nennt muss man kein Wort mehr verlieren. Eurowings Discover - ja geht, aber n ihr alle Getränke in der Premium Eco kostenfrei. Ansonsten ist die Kundenorientierung bei Lufthansa unterirdisch - auch wenn sie selbst Flüge streichen. Finger weg!"
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Calgary to Manchester via Frankfurt,Oct-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  My wife and I traveled with this airline for the first time in business class. The return flights from Calgary to Manchester was delayed approximately 10 hours in total. I applied for compensation online and was contacted by a customer representative, I can honestly say that I have been in business for over 30 years and this representative is the worst I have ever dealt with. He / she argued that Calgary to Manchester was a short haul flight and because of that I was not entitled to full compensation? He / she also said that the conversation would be terminated and would not reply to me further. He / she now is not responding to my emails. You have been warned."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Keflavik to Munich,Oct-22,2,5,4,,,3,3,no,2,  Keflavík to Munich in Business Class in an A320neo. Lufthansa provides an utterly mediocre product on this route. The seating in Business is Economy class-like with the middle seat kept empty and with a little more legroom. No WiFi on this 3+ hours flight. Boarding in Keflavík was a disaster. No separate lane or even allowance for Priority boarding. What is the purpose of spending money on a Business Class ticket if the experience is going to be Economy?
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Mumbai,Oct-22,3,5,5,4,4,4,3,no,7,"  Munich to Mumbai in Business Class in an A350-900. Lufthansa's long haul Business Class product is a mixed bag. With the 2-2-2 seating configuration and the mediocre seats themselves, Lufthansa is way behind the top players in this class. Where Lufthansa shines is the quality of inflight service. This was a comfortable flight but Lufthansa needs to quickly up its hard product game."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Glasgow,Sep-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  I flew from Newark to Glasgow through Frankfurt and my baggage did not make the connecting flight in Frankfurt. It was supposedly put on the same flight the next day, however, I never received it during my entire 9 days in Scotland. I filed a claim for reimbursement of my expenses and was declined because Lufthansa couldn't find a PIR. I provided the baggage claim # from the Glasgow Airport servicing company, Menzies Aviation. I was not advised by Lufthansa or anyone at the Glasgow Airport that I needed to file any other claims or reports. I have emailed Lufthansa at least 4 times since their denial of my claim on 10/03/22 and have received no response. I called Lufthansa customer service and was told that I have to deal with baggage issues by email and there's nobody to speak to regarding the matter. I'm being taken advantage of by an airline and a system that is extremely dysfunctional and unprofessional."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Charlotte via Munich,Nov-22,1,3,1,2,1,4,3,no,5,"  Leg space is pathetic, leg was literally numb on the journey of 10 hours and if someone reclines their seats then we are left with even less leg space. I was in the middle seat and my son is 5ft 10 and he suffered a lot. The second meal provided on the 10 hour flight, the sandwich was extremely pathetic. I couldn't eat even half the sandwich. Veg option was only pasta and it wasn't so great, need to give better meals for sure. Movie selection definitely needs more changes in the regional category."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Krakow via Munich,Oct-22,2,2,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa is one of the worst airlines I've ever flown on. Their desk staff are rude, lie and totally unhelpful I requested a wheelchair at all legs of my trip, when I arrived in Munich they dropped me at the wrong gate and no one from the carrier was around to help (very poor customer service) The same happened in Frankfurt coming home, total mess up and Lufthansa could care less, just plain out and out lies."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,"Frankfurt, Germany to Cairo, Egypt",Oct-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Business Class on Lufthansa is a “joke” and they shouldn’t be able to advertise or sell it as such! Their front cabin is exactly the same as their second coach cabin. 3 small seats on both sides. Tall people like my husband, are absolutely miserable due to no leg room! We have flown business class on many other airlines, but none with business class like Lufthansa! They leave the middle seat vacant to call it “business class” and that should be labelled as “fraud” in my opinion. The food is deplorable and definitely shouldn’t be consumed! It was an all around horrible experience that I will never have again!!!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-313,Business,Economy Class,Seattle to Frankfurt,Nov-22,1,1,1,1,,2,1,no,1," Lufthansa used to be one of my favorite airlines. The only positive thing is the safety, other than this nothing. I flew on my birthday back home. Nobody congratulated me. The food quality is very bad. LH served us lunch after one hour of flying. The food was too dry as LH have overheated it. Then left us without food and drinks for almost 8 hours, then served breakfast with the most worst sandwich you can eat in your life. If you are hungry during the flight, you need to pay for snacks. They have a Green strategy, but most of the people around me did not finish the sandwich, which as a consequence lead to more waste. Pillows and blankets are very bad quality. The cabinet temperature is very cold. Toilet was not cleaned frequently. I am not speaking about a short flight, it is 10 hours flight. The entertainment options are very poor and they have provided us with low quality headset. In general, avoid it by any means!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Geneva to Hong Kong via Frankfurt,Oct-22,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,no,2,"  I was flying out of Geneva to NZ, via Frankfurt and HK. From Frankfurt I had a 1 hour - 40 minute stop over to reach my connecting flight to HK. An hour before the flight was due to depart I received an email advising me that my Geneva tō Frankfurt flight was going to be 15 minutes late. 30 minutes later, I received another email advising that the flight would now be an hour delayed. A Lufthansa representative eventually advised the delay due to a ‘technical’ problem, and that ground staff would at Frankfurt would be on hand to help all passengers with late or missed connecting flights. While waiting for our plane to land in Geneva we were told the replacement plane was smaller than the original intended plane, as such, our hand carry luggage would have to be surrendered upon boarding, This created even more delays. 40 minutes into the flight, the pilot announced that due to bad weather, the flight would be now diverted to Nuremberg. At the Nuremberg tarmac, we were given little information. Hours later we were told we would be bussed to Frankfurt, however we were waiting for a bus to arrive, and also, there were no ground crew to help disembark the luggage. Later, we were told to collect our luggage and wait for the bus. No specific area was designated. Eventually an airport representative came out and advised the bus would be arriving in 10 minutes The bus ride would take approximately 2 and a half hours. During this entire 6-7 hour Geneva to Frankfurt ordeal, passengers were not fed nor given time to use the bathroom. During the bus ride I received emails from Lufthansa advising me they had, without consulting me, rebooked the remainder of my trip home. This rebooking meant an entirely different route, and it would also mean I would arrive back in New Zealand a whole day later than I had intended. At Frankfurt we disembarked at a bus stop. No Lufthansa representative was there to greet or advise us. The bus driver simply drive away with no instructions. A majority of the passengers stood around lost and confused. Using my phone Google maps, I began walking terminal 1 at Frankfurt airport. At the terminal, we discovered it largely deserted. Not surprisingly as it was well after midnight. Most check-in counters were closed. Eventually we found some staff who handed every passenger vouchers for 1 night stay at a hotel and two taxi vouchers and told us we had to sort out our problems in the morning. Weather problems aside, if there were no technical problem with Lufthansa's plane to begin with, we would have landed in Frankfurt on schedule and avoided the airport closure due to ‘bad weather’ and I would have made my flight to Hong Kong. Even after the bad weather and plane diversion issue, the lack of support and help from Lufthansa made the bad experience worse. There was no attempt by Lufthansa to help or guide us from Nuremberg to Frankfurt, and there was no help at all once we arrived at Frankfurt. I have since contact Lufthansa Customer Relations, to date my attempts to contact them have been ignored. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Frankfurt,Oct-22,3,4,1,,,1,4,no,4,  Flight on Time. Good legroom in economy. Drawback was that our flight was cancelled before. Then they gave us another ticket which was fine then three days later they told us that this was not allowed and they did a mistake. So we had to go on a long connecting flight to Bogota instead of direct. Flight itself nice. Only booking and call center are totally crazy.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Zadar to Singapore via Frankfurt,Oct-22,1,1,1,2,,2,2,no,3,"  My flight was from Zadar to Frankfurt and then to Singapore. The flight from Zadar was cancelled after we checked in the bags and just before boarding. No explanation was given. We were automatically re-booked on the same flight 3 days later. That wasn't a problem for us as we are based only 25 minutes from the airport and have our own apartment. However, things could have been much worse. The flight from Frankfurt to Singapore was in an old worn out airplane, with very little leg room. My seat was broken and very uncomfortable. The best they could do was to give me some thick blanket to put under. That made it better, but still not comfortable. The food was the worst I even had on a long flight. First meal was vegetarian ravioli and there was no other choice. When I commented that I am not vegetarian, the flight attendant was very rude, stating that she can only give me what she had. Her delivery was atrocious. The second meal was a very cold and unappealing sandwich. We didn't eat it and had something at Singapore airport instead. We won't be flying Lufthansa again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Prague to Glasgow via Frankfurt,Jul-22,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,yes,10,"  Despite a huge number of negative comments in here, there’s nothing I could reproach to Lufthansa staff, from the whole cabin crew to customer service at FRA airport, they accompanied us on 4 flights (in total) with empathy and highest degree of professionalism. Our return flight from Scotland was cancelled from FRA to Prg, but everything was so well organized at FRA airport despite covid shortages, everyone queuing was given snacks and a drink, then we were automatically given meal & hotel and taxi vouchers when waiting at a hotel for a new flight the next day. This month (October), I finally received a compensation of 250€ per person. (3 persons in total) with excuses for a cancelled flight. Since we traveled in Economy class, we bought awesome fresh ground coffee, a sandwich and Poke bowl, together for 20€. All the food and coffee was super fresh, very quality and tasty, just like the quality I prepare myself home. Definitely worth money. I think Lufthansa offers outstanding quality when it comes to meals. Ecology and sustainability in Lufthansa catering are a big  highlight to me compared to other airlines. I was scared of flying this summer due to covid shortages all around Europe, but thanks to the Lufthansa excellent team it has been a truly pleasant experience. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Toronto,Sep-22,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,yes,10,"  One of the best companies i flew with. The attendants were spot on, and the aircraft was impeccable, didn't find a single flaw. As a connection flight, even the airports have smoking lounges and are perfectly clean with very little smell. I will definitely will fly with Lufthansa from now on."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Premium Economy,Istanbul to Lisbon via Frankfurt,Oct-22,4,2,1,1,1,1,2,no,3," This company provides an amazing experience: at one hand, it’s one of the most expensive airlines, on the other hand, 70% (3 of 4 for last week) of my flights with them were delayed, and any person in the whole team didn’t even tried to tell the passengers why we are waiting at the gate, then waiting on a board. No service that is expected for that cost, no communications, the most expensive delays (I’ve been paying for the timing that is perfect for me: if I’m agree with possible delays, I prefer to spend less money and get on a low-cost flight). Total disappointment."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Zurich to Dubai via Frankfurt,Sep-22,4,4,3,3,4,3,3,no,3," There was a time when I loved Lufthansa, but not anymore. Two flights to Dubai, both cancelled. Arrived at destination over 8 hours later, no hotel offered. Airline downgraded me to a lower class, contacted the airline for a compensation for cancelled flights, the airline refused to pay compensation without stating the reason."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Split to Copenhagen via Munich,Oct-22,3,5,4,,2,4,5,yes,9,"  A decent connection. European style business class. Good attentive service, decent snack on both flights. No complaints at all. Still onboard hoping my luggage is too."
Not Verified ,Embraer,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London City to Frankfurt,Oct-22,3,3,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa cancelled my flight from London City to Frankfurt after the scheduled departure time, then booked me on another flight eight hours later. There was no explanation for the cancellation, and a £10 food voucher was hardly compensation. (For a connecting flight from Frankfurt to Zagreb, they rebooked me on three-star Croatia Air.) I lost the first day of a three-day stay in Zagreb, finally reaching my hotel late at night. Incidentally, my return flight to London City on Swissair was infinitely better in terms of food, drink and comfort. I've given Lufthansa the benefit of the doubt up to now, but shall try to avoid in future."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Ahmedabad via Frankfurt,Jul-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," 3 tickets booked for 3 passengers to fly in December 2022, are for round trip flights booked well over a year in advance for international travel for our daughter's wedding. Since the booking was made, there have been countless flight and schedule changes requiring us to repeatedly contact customer service to accept changes and/or find alternatives as proposed by the agents and re-book on alternate flights with different airlines, timings, dates, airports etc. Despite the extensive flexibility on our end in terms of these factors, every time we called and confirmed a booking with an agent, we were left to find that the booking had either not been made, changed again, or entirely cancelled. We have evidence documenting the numerous calls lasting over 50 hours in total, as well as all the emails/screenshots of bookings from the website documenting the booking changes, as well as the flight cancellations that were made without our knowledge and were not informed of until checking ourselves. At this time, despite multiple attempts to resolve this issue, the itineraries are missing components of the journey as originally booked ie. the last leg of the trip from DEL - AMD for record locators #1 & 2. The customer service agents have not been able to resolve this and have pretty much said there is nothing they can do in terms of ensuring we have confirmed flights for the entire trip as planned and have left us hanging, without answers, and in a panic as our travel date approaches. I also intend to submit a compensation request as advised by an agent in order to be compensated for the price paid for the flights at the time of booking as well as the additional fare difference to book on ticket now with a different carrier, and making the same request to management if they are unable to resolve our problem internally, by booking us on appropriate Lufthansa/Partner flights as booked and paid for."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Orlando,Oct-22,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,yes,8," My husband and I were returning home from a long Europe vacation. We were able to check-in online and ticket counter personnel was nice and professional. Once on board we were greeted by the staff who was extremely cordial and professional with all of us (22 people on the upper deck of the 747-400). The 3 course lunch and the cold dinner we were served were very good, actually one of the best we had eaten on a plane, as well as the wines we selected with every dish. The crew made sure we were all, 22 of us, taking care of and feeling as special passengers. The attention to details that this airline's employees offered us was very much welcomed and appreciated. During the flight, 10 hours in total, we were offered beverages, sweet and salty snacks, and anything else we desired. Once we arrived, the ground personnel advised us that one of our luggage was left in Frankfurt. We filled the paper work to claim for the luggage. When we got home around 9 pm, we received an email confirming that our claim was entered into their system. The luggage arrived 36 hours after we landed."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Singapore,Oct-22,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,no,5,"  Very inefficient. Unable to check in online like a lot of other passengers because their system is unable to verify the docs. No choice but to queue for manual check in which took almost an hour. The food is disappointing too. I opted for low sodium meal. For dinner I was given brown rice with chicken in some salty sauce. And for breakfast, I was given a very sad sandwich, first layer with cucumber, second later with tomato. Also, because I took Lufthansa, I had a stopover at Frankfurt where airport staff are rude and very inflexible. No assistance given to passengers who are about to miss their next flight whatsoever."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,London to Graz via Munich,Jun-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  I traveled for business with Lufthansa from London in the UK to Graz in Austria over the summer. Upon my return, Lufthansa canceled my connecting flight to Munich. They did not offer any rerouting, were not reachable by email or phone and lost my time and over 600 EUR since I needed to rebook on my own and to spent an additional night in Graz. It was an altogether horrific journey since I was pregnant. In correspondence I've had subsequently with Lufthansa trying to invoke my passenger's rights under the EU Passenger Rights regulation, Lufthansa's customer service was disrespectful and rude. No refund was issued."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Rio de Janeiro to Berlin via Munich,Oct-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  This company's customer service is simply unacceptable. I arrived in Berlin six days ago with no luggage. I'm following the instructions given at the airport (to check the website in order to track my luggage), the website says that my luggage was already delivered which is not true. When I call the airline to find out what is going on they say the delivery company CLS is responsible for the service and they can't do anything but give me a phone number so I can call and sort it myself. How come? I paid for the Lufthansa ticket, I checked the bag at the Lufthansa counter, I visit the Lufthansa website to trace the baggage and they are not responsible? Not mention my flight was 7 hours delayed and my connection flight in Munich was overbooked. Negligence, irresponsibility, lack of sensitivity to passengers! Just a horrible experience since."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Tokyo,Oct-22,1,1,1,2,,1,2,no,2,"  Seat space: half. Check in: procedure: non existing. Information about delay: non existing (I got three mails after our arrival in Japan!). Aircraft: Boeing 747-8. The cabin crew turned up just 3 times during a 14-hour-flight, clearly showing that their passengers were a nuisance to them. My meals a real catastrophe - dinner consisted of a pasta dish, breakfast a slice of bread topped with ?. Luggage with priority tags: one piece arrived fairly early, two pieces shortly before the belt was stopped. Overall experience: non existing."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Frankfurt,Aug-22,2,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  They lost my baggage and demonstrated an appalling attitude throughout the course of handling the issue. Having closed my missing baggage claim without my having received my baggage yet, they still have not updated me as to the whereabouts of my baggage. I flew with them back in August 2022. At the time of writing, it is mid-October 2022. Things happen. I get it. What really matters is its resolution. Lufthansa seems to me as if they don't really care about what their customers think. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bogota to Frankfurt,Oct-22,2,4,3,3,1,1,1,no,1,"  Our flight left 2 hours late. While waiting in Bogota we didn't receive any information what was going on. There were 100 people who were left behind at the airport because of the weight of the plane. They had to take another flight. We were lucky to get on the plane. When we arrived in Frankfurt we waited more than 1 hour on our luggage. Nobody knew how long it would take. They even left some of the peoples luggages in Bogota. It was a really bad experience with a long time of waiting. Lucky, the staff on the plane was very kind. That was the only positive aspect."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Sao Paulo to Amsterdam via Frankfurt,Oct-22,4,5,5,4,,1,4,yes,6,"  All was pretty fine, apart from the fact that in the flight back, one of my suitcases was not loaded inside the airplane from FRA to AMS. It has been a month already and it is still sitting inside a warehouse in AMS. I know this because I put an Airtag inside of the suitcase and can track it. Lufthansa claims that ""they have been unable to contact the company that handles bags for them in Amsterdam because they don't answer phone or email"", which is untrue and makes it look even worse for LH. The lack of action and transparency is pretty frustrating. Other than that, the flight itself was good, the outdated C cabin is not very private but surprisingly comfortable, food was pretty good and crew was nice. Also in the outbound leg, the B748 was changed last minute to a B744, which was (at least for me) pretty nice because I had never flown in one. That said, my seat was not changed and I got to still sit in the upper deck. Many people were not so fortunate and this caused quite a bit of a commotion on ground."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo to Munich ,Oct-22,3,1,2,2,1,3,1,no,1,"  Currently flying from HND to MUC is a long trip as flights avoid Russian airspace, approximately 14hrs, or in my case 14hrs of looking at stained plastics, a clicking headset and having to push the tv screen back into place as it works itself free every half hour. Schedule changes feel very much the norm in today's travel however, I would have hoped the passenger log for my flight would have been correct. Shortly after take off the lead member of the cabin crew took his time to introduce himself to some of the passengers with some polite chat. At this point it became apparent, despite checking in 12 hrs earlier the passenger log had no idea who I was. Asked if I was someone I wasn't, an accusing ""have you changed seats"" was delivered followed by the non reassuring ""oh, no don't worry"" and a clear tone of 'your not at a high enough loyalty member to warrant my time' was delivered in a closing remark. It should be easy for the cabin crew to tell the truth, so when during the second meal service I was informed that the first option was no longer available I was surprised to see the opposite row still able to order and receive, with the polite question asking if option 1 was actually available my original meal choice was found. I can't help thinking Lufthansa have stripped all customer service out of their operation, several attempts to contact the team before the flight were ignored, the only engagement came when they cancelled a section of the journey and asked me to call them, nice touch that their automatic email pretends they have tried to contact me. A small connection flight cancellation was apparently enough to confuse the booking system and the many people in the call centre.  It took six hours of my time reviewing the Lufthansa schedule and and their ticketing availability to find a route that the 'system' would allow. To rub salt into the wound, at HND I was approached by an agent for Lufthansa and asked if I would like to change flights,  for one of the routes I had been denied and that had always shown availability. This is not helpful one hour out when I had arranged business calls around the terrible schedule Lufthansa and landed me with."
Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Los Angeles to Istanbul via Frankfurt,Oct-22,3,3,1,2,1,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa by far is one of the worse airlines today. I made a change to my business class air ticket on phone with a Lufthansa representative and got his confirmation and paid him online. The change happened 10 days before the departure. On the day of departure, the counter person told me the Lufthansa had done something wrong and I have to pay $1,700 in order to take the flight. I was shocked and so upset, it took over an hour to have someone on the phone to admit that the problem has been created from their side. However, this was 30 mins before the departure so I barely made it to the flight. I arrived in Istanbul on Oct 12th at 5pm, and I have not yet received my luggage, and it’s been 52 hours since I arrived. I’m so disgusted with the level of unprofessionalism that Lufthansa has demonstrated from booking, online services, checking in, airplane, their cabin service and low quality and quantity of food. Remember, I had a business class ticket, not sure how messed up the economy tickets have been."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Amsterdam to Sao Paulo via Frankfurt,Sep-22,4,4,4,2,,4,4,yes,8," First and most of all, Lufthansa brought me and my luggage to my destination on time and without any hassle, I think that's fair enough to mention these days. Furthermore, the flight was surprisingly pleasant and comfortable, and good service was provided, despite being fully booked. Lufthansa might not be as fancy as Qatar or Singapore, but both dinner and breakfast were decent and drinks were filled up frequently. While the seating arrangement in 2-2-2 is not the latest standard for business class, I found the seat comfortable enough for 11 hours. On these really long flights, Lufthansa now provides extra padding for the seat to sleep on and a sleeping shirt. The only drawback is the entertainment program, there used to be a better selection of movies, and the music selection is really poor, obviously that's the field to cut costs now. Cabin crew did their job in a friendly and professional way, not more, not less."
✅ Trip Verified ,A359,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dusseldorf to Singapore via Munich ,Oct-22,1,1,3,3,,1,2,no,1,"  We had paid for economy seats; my wife went online and reserved aisle seats. She selected seats in a row that was about halfway between the mid and rear toilet areas. (Around row 40) When we arrived at the departure lounge at Munich there was some sort of loud-speaker bargaining situation going on. The Lufthansa staff clerk was stating that a woman in Business class had her seating booking messed up and as such she was going to be separated from her two kids. The clerk was asking for volunteers to give up their seat in order for the woman and her kids to be together. The suggestion was, that the flight wasn't happening until this seat problem was settled. After some time, a guy volunteered to a round of applause from the rest of the people being held up. When we got on board, I got to the row that was printed on my boarding pass that I had been given when we checked our bags earlier in the day. I hadn't checked if the seat matched my wife's online booking from the previous day. When I got to the row shown on my pass, there was a guy sitting on the aisle in what I thought was mine or my wife's seat. A short argument ensued until the guy pointed out the seat next to the window matched my boarding pass. Some people in seats in front of us turned and said they have messed up all the seats. The seats my wife and I endured for 12 hours were right in front of the toilets with little or no movement of our seats or chance to get out without climbing over the lucky winner of the aisle seat. The seats were in a row that was roughly 20 rows different to the one we'd booked. There was no acknowledgement or apology from staff. We noted that the crew were absent from the end of the aisle to welcome passengers to Singapore. Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Brisbane was the third and last leg of our journey, an approximately 8-hour flight. We had tried to once again book our seats online, but the airline was trying to charge $20 dollars for the privilege. So, we just indicated that we'd prefer aisle seats. We received our boarding pass and we'd been given aisle seats in different rows. My wife in the row that is normally reserved for parents with babies and the row immediately behind. When we arrived on board, of course there was a woman with a <1yo baby breast feeding in the adjoining seat. The parents did their best but the crying and continuous getting up and down to silence the baby made sleep impossible for anyone nearby. Cabin staff were noticeably absent in assisting the parents. Avoid Lufthansa at all costs in future."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Billund to Seoul via Munich,Oct-22,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  My first flight was delayed an hour and 15 minutes and as the transfer time in Munich was only scheduled for 40 minutes I missed my direct flight to Seoul. I was then rebooked for another flight 6 hours later from Munich to Singapore with a 7 hour layover to Seoul. The reason I booked Lufthansa in the first place was to get the direct flight from Europe. But apparently there was not even one seat available on the direct route the day after. I could have stayed at an airport hotel and Lufthansa could have at least guaranteed me a somewhat comfortable sleep as compensation for their delay, but instead I get to spend the night on my way to Singapore and a day at the airport, already tired from the long extra wait, not even to mention missing my meetings in Seoul that I had planned. When I booked my original ticket I had paid extra for window seats, but as the window seats were already fully booked I got an aisle seat and when I asked if I could at least be upgraded for the inconvenience I was told that it would be on my own expense. As I will be almost 24 hours delayed I thought as it states on the Lufthansa website, that I would get the necessary care during the redirecting, but all I got was a 15 euro voucher (which had to be spent all at once) in one of the airport restaurants. Sadly most meals start at 20 euros so it should rather be called a modest meal contribution instead. Very sad to have around 24 hours longer to spend in airport transfer with a 15 euro “meal” voucher, aisle seats despite having already paid for window seats and a service level below minimum. Sad experience with Lufthansa today. Cannot recommend to anyone."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Venice to San Francisco via Munich,Oct-22,3,2,1,2,,1,2,no,1," This is the worst company to fly with. We flew it coming here because my husband is European and he believed Lufthansa was a good airline. We first took it from SFO and the first problem was they made us pay for luggage even though I showed the agent that our ticket included 1 checked luggage. I always pay for luggage beforehand because it’s a lot cheaper than what they make you pay at the airport. He made us pay $75 anyways. This rubbed me the wrong way but I went on with the vacation. Of course my husband wanted to use them going back to SFO so we did. First, they left late so the plane was delayed and we missed our connection. We tried to run and make it but were held up in Germany because the lady was upset that she couldn’t find a stamp in my passport even though I kept telling her I have a residency card for Italy so I don't get a stamp. We missed our connection and then had to deal with customer service from hell at Lufthansa. They guy was unbelievably rude. I first asked him if there was another, earlier flight he could put us on so that we wouldn’t have to sit at the airport for like 5 hours. He said no. I asked him if there was a customer service centre and I guess that made him mad because from there he became rude. He told us that we didn’t even pay that much for our ticket and it wasn’t ‘that bad’ and I should be fine with it because it’s not like I’ve never had a delayed flight before. He continued on being rude. I think customer service is definitely the wrong profession for him. I have never ever had to deal with someone like him and I’ve been flying all over the world since I was a teenager. We missed our connection because of their mistakes and instead of being empathetic and kind, he was the opposite. Absolutely despicable. I will never ever fly this airline again. To top it off, he gave us seats that weren’t next to each other for an 11 hour flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham  Frankfurt,May-22,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Horrendous airline, I hate dealing with them. I have no alternative with the route, visas etc, but every time we have problems. If it's not baggage, it's ticket reissues, they take the money then don't update the system, tickets confirmed so you think it's all ok, don't be fooled this is Lufthansa! your then invited to check in, and you can't sue to the departure time, but it's within 24 hours and your wife's checked in fine. So you call, and your waiting for 48 minutes, then another 42 mins to sort it out. Even after your told it's done, DO not trust it. I've had the same thing on every single booking I've had to change dates for, they are horrific. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Buenos Aires to Oslo via Frankfurt,Oct-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Worst airline ever. Rude, mean and passive aggressive. Flight was delayed six hours and all restaurants at the airport were full. Staff would only allow us into the lounge if we paid. Miles and More does not give you any benefits ever. Login at Lufthansa is almost impossible. Flight attendants are rude. Staff at the airports are rude. Customer service is incompetent, and you risk making matters worse if you call to ask for help (I asked for a simple confirmation of the names on the tickets and three times in a row they sent me a confirmation that only half our group was traveling). Horrible. Will never use again. Not recommended."
Not Verified ,A340,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Singapore via Frankfurt,Sep-22,1,2,1,1,,1,1,no,1,"  LHR-Frankfurt was 90 minutes late leading to a two hour hour connection reduced to 30 minutes to get from plane to gate - found the cabin manager a bit unprofessional at times. After a 1km sprint across frankfurt, made the gate for the next departure to Singapore in a pretty dated plane. Seats were uncomfortable with not a lot of space and the inflight was a big let down. The crew were absent after first meal to 1 hour before landing with zero refreshments inbetween - not even any water or juice, you had to make your way to the back of the plane and pay for it. The food was possibly the worst plane meal I've ever been served, with no option - just vegetarian mushroom stew.. With no other option I had to make do with buying a tube of pringles and a twix to last 11 hours until the cheese sandwich for breakfast. Having set in various stress positions for 12.5 hours, I was relieved to get off with the dreaded fear of having to return on the same airline. Expected so much more - I'll stick with BA for future."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Economy Class,Oslo to Frankfurt,Oct-22,1,2,1,4,1,3,1,no,2," Lufthansa is by far the worst airline in Europe. Over a period of 1 year (I unfortunately fly often with LH as I live in FRA), I have experienced: - 2 flight cancellations - 6 flight delays - 1 overbooking issue. Not only that, but it is the only airline in the world that charges 850€ for a FRA-LON flight, and makes you buy your soda. The seat pitch in economy is the shortest of any airline (Ryanair is comfortable in comparison). In transatlantic flights, they only serve vegetarian food in both meals. Finally the service on ground and on deck is lacklustre. If you can avoid, please do."

Family of 6 with a baby and 3 small children, midnight, no luggage or pram - as they refused to off load, all Lufthansa hotels were full to sleep over. Were told to find own accommodation and airline will refund. Ended up having to fly via Angola instead of direct, which was also delayed for several hours. Was told would not get bassinet and extra leg room (we paid for - as flying with baby and 3 small children) stroller went missing on arrival in Johannesburg! And worst part is still waiting for our accommodation refund despite various phone calls, emails etc to Lufthansa. Despite being told reimbursement will occur. It's been 4 months. Worst customer care. No service. Despite full responsibility and blame lying with Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Miami via Munich & Frankfurt,Sep-22,1,2,1,3,2,2,1,no,1," Athens to Miami via Munich & Frankfurt. Had to pay an extra $200 for my carry-on when they had said it was free first. Again the couple flying with me had the same luggage and paid nothing. The seat for 10hr flight was super tight and uncomfortable. We had 2 layovers with no time to even go to the restroom or anything cause they leave you at a gate and you layover flight is at the other end of the airport so you have to run to get there on time, so I was unable to get anything to eat. The food on the plane was horrible, they only had vegetarian food - no choice. I don't eat vegetables so all in had to eat in the 10hr flight was a piece of stiff cold bread with a little butter and a sip of Sprite. I will never fly the airline again."

Got myself one of the best seats available on LH’s A321 (11A/B/C) with really has lots of space and I enjoyed the ride. Of course we are miles away of what LH’s cabin service used to be, but we got a little bottle of water and a small chocolate. Nice feature was one could follow the route on an own device when connecting (without buying) to the onboard WiFi system. All ok for such short flight. Most important, I safely got at destination."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Hamburg to Munich,Sep-22,1,5,1,,,1,1,no,3," Hamburg to Munich. This Business Class trip was in two points worse than before. In Hamburg, no fast lane was available at the security control. The queue was too long, given the booking of a full fare premium product at a premium carrier. The second point was meal service. It consisted of cheese cake only (see picture) - cost cutting has reached the bottom. I feel sorry for the staff, who have to deliver this terrible level of service to Business Class customers. From now on, Lufthansa Business Class stopped to be an option for me, as German Railways ICE 1st Class product is in every point superior - and much cheaper."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Muscat via Munich,Aug-22,2,2,1,2,,1,2,no,2,"  Not a good experience all round with Lufthansa. I thought it was supposed to be a reputable airline but the service provided to us after we missed our connection in Munich (at the fault of the airline) was extremely poor, and frankly embarrassing for a member of Star Alliance. First, the positives. They automatically booked us on the next flight once our connection had been missed, although this sadly did involve another connection in Frankfurt. Also our baggage did not get lost. So they do get 2/10 for these 2 positives. So, what went wrong? Inconveniently, there was not a single member of Lufthansa staff available at the airport in Munich. Thankfully we had downloaded the Lufthansa app, which seemed to be the only way of accessing the information of the new itinerary. Customers who did not have the app really struggled to find the information as there was no email or SMS communication. EU passenger rights say that the airline is obliged to provide hotel accommodation if the delay is overnight. However, we were told by the cabin crew during the descent that we had to book our own accommodation and then ""send them the bill"". We took the alternative option of staying in the airport, as there was only an 8 hour gap before the new flight to Frankfurt departed. Having to spend a night in Munich airport with our 2 year old was not the greatest experience. The food that Lufthansa provided was frankly shocking. Crisps, chocolate biscuit bars and sugary drinks do not constitute a meal, and this disappointment came after no complimentary food was served on the flight into Munich. All the restaurants, cafes and shops in the airport were closed, so we went without an evening meal that day. Lufthansa did provide blankets and pillows, and then we set about trying to find a place to sleep. The designated sleeping area clearly had not been cleaned. There were only 4 private pods which were all taken, so we ended up with a majorly uncomfortable night on the floor of the airport. Perhaps this is not necessarily the fault of Lufthansa, but if they are not going to book hotels for passengers then they should at least make sure the airport sleeping areas are clean. The next morning we boarded our new flight to Frankfurt at 6am. On arrival, I searched out the Lufthansa service desk to make a complaint, but again found an empty desk. Most disappointingly, we were not able to speak to a member of Lufthansa staff that could help during the entire journey. They did sent a breakfast voucher via email, however the voucher was not accepted by the cafe closest to our gate for Muscat, so that meant spending an extra €17 for breakfast for the 3 of us. No further dramas onward to Muscat, however this flight was with a partner airline. It has been over a month since the flight and still no correspondence from Lufthansa regarding the compensation that we are entitled to by law. The only communication we've had was an email telling us to confirm our new itinerary (sent 2 days AFTER we arrived) and an automated email in response to my complaint, which asked me to submit my flight details (which I had already done 3 times by this point). This experience is in stark contrast to a previous experience with KLM, travelling to Dubai via Amsterdam, where we were given the compensation in cash at the service desk, and there was a driver waiting outside to take us to a hotel for the night. We have no desire to travel again with Lufthansa."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Mexico City to Munich via Frankfurt,Sep-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa made my trip a living hell. I was in for a very important business meeting in Germany. Not only did they lose my luggage with all my valuable things, they made me lose my meetings, because I had nothing to wear. The people from Customer Service and lost luggage where rude, badly mannered. They claim they will pay for clothes, but they really throw difficult procedures which you will end up not paying you for any reimbursement. It is the worst airline in the world, they left me for a week in Europe without any clothes or luggage."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Barcelona via Frankfurt,Sep-22,3,4,2,2,,1,1,no,1,"  Horrible transit organization in Frankfurt airport and Lufthansa. It takes more than 90 minutes to pass all baggage checks and passport control and finaly I missed my flight. I will never use this airport and I will try to avoid Lufthansa as much as I can. If you will have flights outside EU frew Frankfurt airport I recommend to take minimum 140-150 minutes time between flights. Now I received new ticket and need to wait for 2 more hours, also service women didn't believed me that I spent all this time in lines and try to blame me for that."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Glasgow to Atlanta via Frankfurt,Sep-22,1,3,2,2,,1,1,no,1,"  We flew our group of six with Lufthansa to Scotland without any delays or difficulties. When we checked in to return home, one of our group members was stopped because her maiden name was on her passport and her married name was on her ticket. Our booking agency, the check in counter, and the Lufthansa customer service line would not assist us with a name correction. We had been first in line at check-in, and went back and forth with the representatives for Lufthansa until we had less than an hour til our flight would take off. We were told we had to buy a $3500 ticket. When we attempted to, the airline couldn't verify our information and rejected the purchase. A supervisor for Lufthansa overrode the restrictions and let our last group member through. We made it to our gate and when we went to board the plane, all our tickets were denied. The same supervisor was at the gate and told us our booking agent had canceled all our tickets without authorization. We called the booking agent who said our tickets were still all confirmed from their end. Then we called the Lufthansa customer support representative who we had talked with earlier. She told us someone at the Glasgow Airport had canceled our group and given away our tickets for both flights of our trip home. We were told we would have to buy six new tickets for a later flight. The gate closed but by some miracle, the pilot heard what had happened and let our group on the plane because we had confirmation numbers, boarding passes, and passports. We encountered the same probably at our layover in Frankfurt. At a small security checkpoint, all our boarding passes were flagged. At the gate, the representative told us our flights had been canceled and given away. She seemed unsurprised at the predicament as if Lufthansa had caused similar issues before and assured us she would do her best to get us on the flight home. We were all able to return home on standby. When we arrived in Atlanta, Lufthansa had lost all of our bags. We cannot recommend Lufthansa and will not be using their services in the future."

✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Business,Premium Economy,Chicago to Munich,Sep-22,1,2,2,2,2,3,2,no,3,"  Both the flight there and back had lots of room for improvement. The seats in premium economy were most uncomfortable. There was little to no padding, they were old and worn, and the footrest only went to my mid calf. I'm 6'0 tall, so not even overly tall, these were made for little people I think. The food was so-so, nothing special. The stewards had little to no customer service skills, very abrupt and to the point. The in-flight entertainment screen forces you to buy the wifi service to connect your phone with the app to the TV. No option to just connect personal headphones with Bluetooth, very disappointing."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Washington,Sep-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  They changed our seats without telling us. Service was mediocre at best. They moved our bag packs from the upper bin and displaced them somewhere else without telling us which caused us to panic thinking that someone had taken our bags with all of our personal belongings in them. No apology was offered whatsoever. When I asked for an explanation, one of the flight attendants sarcastically said, “you found your bags right?” It’s safe to say that we will not be flying with them again."

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Newark,Sep-22,2,3,4,,1,4,3,no,7,"  After most recently having flown Polaris class on United and the business class on Air Canada, The flight on a 747 Lufthansa in business class was disappointing. We understand that sometimes when there is the third class, the first class, they have to downgrade the business class. But I guess this might just be an older plane and the seats were tight, and there was no storage space or little cubbies. I’m not even a tall person and I found the seats to be less than well padded. The food service was okay, but it was served off of trolleys like you were in coach. We haven’t seen anything like this in another business class. And, they didn’t give an amenity kits. When we went to the lavatories, we saw offerings of masks and razors and earplugs, but nobody told us about them, And some items were already empty. When you’re paying for business class, you really should get an amenity kit. Even if it’s not the best one in the world. The minimal amount they’re saving, that’s really shameful. Also, they didn’t offer us bottled water until we got off the plane. And the flight that was seven hours to eight hours long, they really should give you a bottle of water if you’re going to take a nap so you can take sips as you need it. One more thing, the Wi-Fi wasn’t working at all. I definitely would not fly Lufthansa for a transatlantic flight again."

✅ Trip Verified ,A320 / A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Tel Aviv via Frankfurt,Aug-22,3,5,1,1,1,2,2,yes,4,"  I booked this flight via Brussels Airlines, so this was codeshare. The first leg from Brussels to Frankfurt was Okay, I do not remember anything extraordinary about it, it was a short 40 minute flight in a regular plane with a regular very-short-haul experience. The second leg from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv was rather odd. We had a connection of 2.5 hours. When we landed in Frankfurt on time the screens showed us the flight was already boarding, which we found to be very weird. We sprinted to the gate, through connection security and passport control, and were devastated to discover that apparently, Israel has special travel regulations that make all flights landing to Israel go through a special process. Our gate was separated from all other gates, it had extra security and when we passed it we saw there is no plane even at the gate. So after security we were essentially locked in a gate that had only one super-over-priced store selling basic literature and food. We waited for 90 minutes until boarding started. When we sat in the plane the pilot announced that our plane ""has the wrong wheels"" and that it would take us 3 hours to replace all the wheels of the aircraft. All passengers were angry. After 40 minutes the captain announced that we will be brought back to the gate, and transferred to a different aircraft. After an hour buses were organized to the new airplane, same model, A321. Once we arrived there were a few dramas involving passengers that were mad that because the configuration was a bit different in the new plane, couldn't seat next to their loved ones. After an intervention of the German police we took off. The crew was excellent, especially A Stadelmann, who although being very tired as we did, did her best and gave an excellent service. At turbulence when I panicked she noticed and calmed me, we had a quick chat and all in all she was very welcoming, using words like ""dear"" to make me feel warm and welcome aboard the plane. The flight was regular, there was no entertainment, and complimentary soft drinks and disgusting sandwiches were given. We landed in a delay of almost three hours, the flight after the drama went perfectly fine. Lufthansa should check her planes twice before almost letting passengers fly in them! I would fly Lufthansa again to make my up my opinion about them fairly."

Breakfast was a dry roll with a bit of salad and salmon paste, an orange flavored breakfast roll and a bit of muesli dropped on 2 spoonfuls of yogurt. Coffee is served with your meal not afterwards. Meal is served and drink options arrived 10 mins after your food. No menu options at all, it’s vegetarian or do without. The entertainment system on our return flight was faulty and just a handful of movies and tv were available.

I addressed her as “MAM” to request but her response was “I can’t do anything for you now” rudely. She never approached me again as to why I was calling her. I had to bear the immense pain while taking off and landing. While serving the food she almost insulted me when I asked her if this food contains any kind of meat as she served the food without notifying us veg or non veg.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Munich,Sep-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,  This is the worst international airline I have ever flown. We purchased Economy class for free luggage. Leaving the states they accepted the Economy but overseas it all of a sudden turned into Economy light. Even with proof of purchase they argued with me and refused to accept the receipt of purchase. They then refused check in and changed our seats from the front to the back. For 24hr the website cancelled our check in and then continued to force more money out of us. The planes are in the worst condition the food is horrible and the staff is not friendly. I will continue to write proper reviews so more people realize this company is fraudulent.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Istanbul via Frankfurt,Sep-22,1,3,1,3,3,3,1,no,3,"  Denver to Istanbul via Frankfurt. We flew Lufthansa for the majority of our connecting flights to and from Istanbul. We were very disappointed in the level of service for many reasons. First and foremost, we discovered (and were never notified of) the fact that our layover times had been changed so significantly that we found ourselves on the return trip sprinting for our gate each time. Secondly, the quality of the airplanes left a lot to be desired: they were creaky, cramped, the seats had minimal cushioning, and they lacked proper ventilation. The plane on the international leg of return trip was so unbearably hot, we couldn't sleep or get comfortable at all. Thirdly, the quality of the food was horrible - you were given only one option vegetarian pasta for dinner and a dry, horrible tasting vegetarian sandwich for the other. I cannot understand how this airline is rated as 4 stars! This airline does not bill itself as budget, but the service is worse than what other budget airlines offer. I will do everything possible to not fly Lufthansa ever again."

I have flown Lufthansa a few times before and I do not remember it being this bad. From the inedible food, to the lack of service, I will not fly again or recommend it to anyone for a Business Class experience. The food all around was bad, they didn't have the type of liquors listed in the menu, the inflight wifi was spotty or didn't work. On top of all of this, the flight attendants are some of the worst I remember and they still have a mask mandate. All reasons to avoid Lufthansa completely!"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747,Family Leisure,Business Class,São Paulo to Frankfurt,Sep-22,4,5,5,5,,5,5,yes,9,"  Lufthansa offers a good product on this route. The seat seemed rather spacious, and they offered various extras like a mattress, pyjamas etc. which other airlines have eliminated. The bed was comfortable, apart from the narrow space for the feet. The end of the bed narrows down a lot, so your feet touch each other all the time when sleeping. The food was abundant, portions big and very tasty. The crew were efficient and nice, but not overbearing. I liked that they offer a healthy breakfast option consisting of cottage cheese and fruit. It was a great flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Rio de Janeiro via Munich,Sep-22,4,5,1,4,,4,2,no,3,"  Amsterdam to Rio de Janeiro via Munich. On August 4th, I flew economy to Munich, LH501, and was in shock with the bad quality and presentation of the food offered: a cheap sandwich, followed by a plain slice of cucumber, no dressing. We all starved for 8 hours until we received a frozen bun with a cheap slice of cheese. Later, I was inquired about my satisfaction related to the flight. I expressed my frustration, and a robot like survey took place, asking 50 questions, aiming at a mistake. The return flight, on the other hand: September 4th (LH501) offered a less disgusting meal: a sticky mushroom ravioli, cucumber with a dressing sachet, but 7 hours into the flight, the crew rolled a trolley with expensive snacks, and only one hour, prior to landing, we were haunted with a frozen cheese - cucumber sandwich. Not enough? On this very flight, front economy passengers who have paid + US$30,00 for a broader seat, were offered a choice of the main course and free complimentary spirits, all this smell moving backwards, there was no curtain separation. They didn’t order the food itself, it denotes economic bigotry. I paid US$1500,00, and wasn’t enough for a better meal? Though I knew before hand, Lufthansa was cutting costs, but they’ll sure go bankruptcy, boosted by two strikes. Actually, I didn’t fly AF or KLM, because they warned on their chaotic operation. I guess other passengers are flooding sites with complaints."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,Sep-22,3,4,1,2,1,1,3,no,3,"  This time around my bag was at 32kg, and I was fine to pay fees. Well, if every other company changes $100 for overweight bags, Lufthansa charged me $170, without previous telling me the price. I only found out this after it went through my bank. When I asked at the bag drop off station why she never told me the price, lady did not have any answer, just keep saying “Well.” This is second time Lufthansa got my plans messed up in a week, first canceling and changing my flight from Paris, now this. Saying that I am unhappy, it’s not saying enough. In the future I will do my best to avoid using Lufthansa for my flights. Costumer service is at zero."

Don’t book with Lufthansa ever. 12-14 hours wait to speak to their customer rep which are absolutely rude and disrespectful. They will keep you on hold for hours and keep increasing the price every time they take you off the hold. I confirmed on date and price of the booking, they put me on hold for 2 hours and after said the price is now changed to double the amount. The rep was so rude that she wouldn’t even listen and kept on shouting on the phone. This is the worst airline and service I have ever received. "

The cabin crews were polite but very dry and unpleasant. The IFE was from the 1990's era with very limited material to watch Very nostalgic. There was only one choice of food for this five hour flight: Pasta. Wi Fi was not free For the airline that charges premium. This is a very poor service and product line.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Beirut to Frankfurt,Aug-22,1,4,1,1,,2,2,no,2,"  Very frustrating and disappointing experience. Flight cancellation without proper information delivery to the client via email. I received an email that seemed like a receipt email and not an email stating that my flight had been cancelled. Furthermore i was re booked to a flight that was at the same time of one of my connecting flights, I was re booked a second flight the next day , however Lufthansa did not take responsibility for the errors made by their company. Tthey worked with a lack of professionalism and empathy as if you were another number they had to deal with. Bad food ( cold sandwich with cheese and carrot and very poor entertainment). This airline cannot be compared to airlines of the same level such as British airways, Air France or Turkish airlines. It is at the level of the cheap new airlines."

It has been until proceeding with the checking-in that I found out that my flight itinerary wasn't finalized by one of their operators. Without getting any warning and/or email I found out that the last flight was canceled. I had to spend over 6 hours over the phone to have one of the operators finally admitting their mistake, the booking has been left open, and once expired Air New Zealand, operating under Lufthansa, never received the confirmation (hence the cancelled flight). After several calls one operator was able to re-book another flight, two days later the re-booked flight for an extra cost of 654.34 EUR. While all the previous operators were unprepared and useless giving me more expansive options or wrong information about US visas and flights. I am writing all this from LA, an unwanted stop over, where my luggage got lost and while my partner is already back in New Zealand, flying alone, since her ticket (same as mine) was processed regularly. Without mention all the stress caused from all the situation, the last day of holiday lost and spent at the phone, and the three days of work wage lost because of a Lufthansa mistake."

Our boarding in Frankfurt was delayed with an hour, then we had to wait another 1.5 hours on the plane because of refueling and waiting for the baggage to be loaded. After a total of 2.5 hours of wait we finally took off. Came to find out at the baggage claim in Budapest that they never loaded luggage on the plane. The local agent said that Lufthansa called them hours earlier that no checked-in luggage will be on this flight, and that they already informed the passengers, which of course never happened. They lost 2 baggage of mine. I immediately filed a report online, but now after 24 hours there's still no significant update. The local handling agent, doesn't pick up the phone.

We have been status of our baggage and still showing nothing. The flight was supposed to leave Frankfurt yesterday 4:15 and was delayed and departed 6:33pm, while waiting they kept on telling us the delay is due to runway delay, then our baggage are being loaded, etc. We have been to Europe a couple of times, this is the first time we used Lufthansa , and definitely this will be the last. Worst experience ever, staff are rude. Flight from lax to Frankfurt is 11hrs something and they served us small very sour pasta with a couple of cold breads, then on breakfast just 1 weird tasting sandwich. 2nd day, still no status on our luggage, they are answering phone and replying to our email."

The inbound flight had pasta with ketchup as the only choice served with shredded old and dry lettuce and the pre-arrival meal was a sandwich consisting of two pieces of dry dark cred with one slice of Swiss cheese and some shredded carrots. The wi-fi to purchase was not available and the aircraft an old A340-300 was very dirty. The crew distributed food and disappeared for the rest of the flight.

Seats were economy seats with the one in the middles blocked, my seat did not recline and this was a night flight where you would want to have a sleep. No welcome drink, no towels, rude staff unwilling to offer you anything, my wife asked for a glass of water 30 minutes before landing but was told she can't have one, tried to sleep on the back row of seats only to be awaken by the hostess claiming these are reserved for crew! Lousy breakfast, no ear heads, no music, no screen. Lufthansa should be ashamed."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tampa to Billund via Frankfurt,Aug-22,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa has lost its reputation as a real major airline and has entered the category of budget airlines like RyanAir. I was really disgusted on my last flight. It was booked on lufthansa.com, though the gate was Eurowings Discover and the first plain was Finnair. On a transatlantic flight, the flight attendants were charging people to have a blanket.  I refused the blanket on principal and was freezing cold and slept one hour the whole flight. I ordered a Gluten Free meal when I booked my flight and when the meal came, it was solid gluten and not a single item served was something I can normally eat (pasta, bread, cracker, cheese, potato salad). I told the attendant that I had ordered a gluten-free meal and she said that their airline does not serve gluten-free meals and that Lufthansa had just booked me on a partner airline. She said that all that was left on the flight was the gluten-heavy ""vegetarian"" meals (which is worse than even a regular meal). When the airplane landed and we had to wait a long time to taxi to our gate (making us almost late for our next flight) the stewardess would not let me use the restroom while we waited. And she was rude about it. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Frankfurt,Jul-22,1,3,1,2,3,1,1,no,2,"  I would never describe Lufthansa as a top rated airline, especially when you’ve tried some Asian airlines such as Singapore. I agree with reviews that the aircraft are clean but very uncomfortable. My flight in July reached a new level. The food provided by this airline was in own category of indescribable mess. In this day and age it should not be difficult to prepare a sandwich which does not make you ill. The staff were actually quite pleasant but did not bother much with water through the night which is usually served on other airlines. I take the flight Sydney to Frankfurt almost every year at least once a year but have not flown with Lufthansa for many years as other Asian airlines are far superior. Explore Singapore Air, Emirates or Qatar."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Wroclaw to Denver via Frankfurt,Aug-22,2,3,1,1,2,3,2,no,3,  Lufthansa was a huge disappointment. I started flying with Lufthansa from the US to Europe in 2015. Their quality of service decreased drastically. There's no choice of food. Planes are dirty. No free spirits are available anymore. Food portions are laughable. It's just not worth the price. I flew with KLM to Europe at the beginning of the month and the service was superb compared to Lufthansa. It was my last time I has flown with them. After 7 years my journey with Lufthansa comes to an bitter end.

We have medicines inside, apart from all the safari equipment. Nobody from the company has contacted although we filled the formal report. The guide has tried to take us to a mall where we have only found toiletries and panties. It has ruined our safari after saving to be able to take my daughters on an expensive flight."

Both times I have never gotten my baggage by the time I reached my destination. They delayed my baggage causing me a lot of inconvenience. The second time I travelled with them I thought I would be giving them another shot, but soon I realized that I made a mistake. Never repeating this mistake. I will never fly with Lufthansa again. I had the worst experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Munich,Jul-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa lost our luggage and could care less. They kept saying it will be delivered to our hotel in France and that day never came. Went the whole 16 days without any luggage for myself, husband and toddler. They have horrible customer service and no empathy. It’s been almost 2 months and still no update on where our luggage is and they haven’t refunded us for anything. We have spent $10,700 for the flights and clothes/toiletries we had to buy while we were there. Our lost luggage totaled at least $7,400. Don’t take Lufthansa at all costs, they should be shut down."

First they send an email for customers to come to the airport at 2:30am, the staff don't show up till 3:15 am Cabin crew from the first flight was extremely rude. She was aggressive when I was trying to ask a small question regarding my connecting flight and walked away. Food and beverage was shocking, 2 flights 7 hours of flying I was offered 2 small pieces of chocolate, and 1 tiny sandwich - it was more like dry bread with a dice of vegetable. It was shocking no option to even buy anything. And since the flight was delayed there was no time to get anything in Frankfurt Airport. To add to all this the airline lost my bag! Lufthansa is now by far the worst airline I have flown."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Business,Economy Class,London to Munich,Aug-22,2,4,,,,3,3,yes,6,"  Friendly staff at check-in who confirmed my seat as being 10D only to find that I was moved to 10C when someone else was sitting in 10D with a boarding pass, oh well other than confusing no issue there. Flight left a few minutes late as they had to take on extra fuel to avoid a 1hour delay so I was happy about that and it was clearly communicated. Seat being right in front of the emergency exit meant that it had no recline and actually seems more upright than the normal seats, so will try to avoid them in future. Boarding was a free for all with a long line and no logic to it. Crew friendly but nothing special. They get you there along with your bags but so do most discount carriers."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Business,Economy Class,Munich to London,Aug-22,4,4,,,,4,3,yes,7,"  Comfortable flight which departed on time and arrived in LHR a little bit early. Overall nothing to complain about for a 1.5 hour flight. This is also the first time that I have flown them since they stopped serving food or drinks, other a free bottle of water. Since you have to pay for most things I would not consider LH a full service airline any more. That said crew were friendly and kept us updated during the flight and the luggage also arrived."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Katowice to Boston via Frankfurt,Jul-22,2,4,3,3,,3,4,no,3,"  This is not Lufthansa anymore. You should change the name because you bring shame to the company I know. I have been a Lufthansa customer for over 30 years. Mainly I fly from the USA to Europe and around Europe. However, the last trip was a nightmare. I had booked a return flight to the USA from Katowice Via Frankfurt to Boston. I made the reservation 6 months before departure. 8 days before departure, I received an email informing me that my scheduled flight LH1363 from Katowice to Frankurt was canceled, no reason was given, and no alternative flight was offered either. I called Lufthansa USA asking what options could be offered to us, I got a reply with no alternative options for us! I checked the connection from Krakow to Frankfurt on a regular Lufthansa website and guess what? There was a flight from Krakow to Frankfurt LH 1371 on the same day and time as my canceled flight from Katowice. I called Lufthansa USA again with a request to change the canceled flight from Katowice to the one from Krakow. A sleepy lady (probably from India because she spoke English poorly) stated that there is no such flight! And he can offer us a flight from Katowice To Berlin from Berlin to Munich and from Munich to Frankfurt. Of course, I interrupted the conversation because my patience was exhausted. On the Lufthansa website I have easily booked a flight from Krakow to Frankfurt LH1371 (July 22.2022). Of course I had to pay for this flight separately as no one at Lufhansa wanted to help us and rebook for this flight. Let me add here that the distance between Katowice and Krakow airports is less than 63 miles. And for the best now, Lufhansa is refusing to reimburse the full costs of the flight they have canceled. From the amount I paid $ 1135, they returned $ 86.90 so far! After 30 years of traveling with Lufthansa, it's time to say goodbye to them. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Montreal to  via Munich,Jul-22,4,5,3,5,5,5,5,yes,9,"  On June 18, 2022, I had a problem with my trip as I did the reservation on Expedia, and I did not know until I was at the airport in Montreal, Canada. I asked about the Manager, and I was very angry and disappointed. Then, I met with Mrs. Sana Zubair the team leader in Lufthansa. She was really a very different person and she could calm me down first. She told me that she will do her best to make me travel today. She tried for over half an hour without feeling tired and with a welcoming smile on her face. Then in the middle of her call, she told me that I will travel today on my flight, then she continued to complete her phone call to do all the required steps. She took my two bags to weigh them and asked if I can pay for the second page. I paid and then she gave me all the boarding passes for my 2 trips. I would like to thank her for her patience and time. She told me from the beginning that, she would never ever start by telling any traveler that he will not travel today unless she tried her best in every case. I asked her for her full name as I really would like to thank this smart, hard-working woman. Thank you again and please Lufthansa take my feedback seriously as she made me love to travel with you again after I decided to be my last trip with you. She deserves to be in management and critical position. She is not the same type of employee that you meet every day. She knows how to deal with tired unsleeping disappointed travelers like me. Many thanks again to her and to Lufthansa."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Chicago,Aug-22,1,1,2,3,,1,1,no,1,  Munich to Chicago and it was a nightmare. Staff is not happy at all. Seats are small. I was in the middle and there is no room to move your legs.  When I booked this flight they said I would have seats by the exit which would give me more room. That did not happen. I think our seats were given to a couple that was affected by strike. We had issues with the plane in Munich and that made us miss our connecting flight to St.Louis. When we landed in Chicago everyone from Lufthansa was gone. They had us go to so many different terminals. And if anyone is familiar with Chicago airport that's miles away. I called Lufthansa customer service and they told me they couldn't help because it had be to be done at the airport.  I had to rent a car to finally get home and that cost me a fortune. They don't even want to reimburse me for that.

✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Family Leisure,Business Class,Seattle to Frankfurt ,Aug-22,1,3,4,4,2,3,1,no,4,"  One way flight after US road trip from Seattle WA back to Germany Frankfurt in Business Class. Price was outrageous, around 6,700 EURO / person, so 21,000 EUR altogether. Service for that price was completely inadequate. Seating: I'm tall but not super tall (6 ft 5''). Did not fit while sleeping into the narrow seat on the A330-300 Business Class, thus couldn't sleep at all. Used to fly a lot between NYC and FRA on the 747-800 (Business Class). That is a completely different size of seat, so it feels like they are trying to fit more seats into Business Class by shrinking the comfort.  Not enough Meals: We were 3 persons on that flight, each person getting their menu at the beginning of the flight. Turns out, they couldn't serve us what we wanted as they did not have enough meals on board. Compare that against the ticket price of 6,700 EURO per person. Also cabin service overall was mediocre ... this is a 9 h 30 min flight and there was close to zero service between meals. You had to actively get up and ask for anything you wanted. Can understand if you try to minimize disturbing sleep of the passengers, but no service is not the answer to that. Lastly, I have gold status (Senator) at LH and was asking at check in if they could connect that flight with my miles account which they said they did ('Are you sure?' Yes!). Turns out, this is not the case. Other than that, check in was nice and helpful. So overall after that experience in combination with that premium price, I would say LH are on the way to serve the market with premium marketing and price, but mediocre performance. Will prevent flying with them again on long haul trips, especially if I see an A330-300 is servicing the trip."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Santiago de Compostela to Chicago via Frankfurt,Aug-22,,,,,,4,3,no,2,"  Lufthansa provides really poor customer service. We had to cancel our flight because they denied our kitten from flying with our family. This was because there is a ""2 pet limit"" of pets that can travel in cabin. But why would they have such a tight limit for small pets that travel in a carrier under your seat? We had booked our flights 2 months in advance and there was no option to add a pet to our booking online. Customer service agents and supervisors were extremely unhelpful. This forced us to cancel and have to book a last minute flight with a different airline. We will try to completely avoid Lufthansa in the future."

This new CEO was previously in charge at Eurowings, which I have been led to believe, word of mouth, is not a good company to travel with. If he does not have the decency to reply, and Lufthansa from being a decent airline has become a shambles what does that say about his running of the company?

Booked in May 2022 already. Had the booking confirmation, flight details everything. Booking the ticket over the phone with Lufthansa in May was also a mission and a horrible experience. When we tried booking in online, the day of the flight, Lufthansa didn't know about the booking. After spending the whole day on the phone with Lufthansa, we missed our flight. Lufthansa said we didn't have a booking. We need to book another flight, costing much more. So we booked another flight for 2 August, the evening. We however didn't get the ticket confirmation in time, so missed the flight. Lufthansa just shrugged their shoulders. There is no accountability or care from their side! "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Frankfurt,Jul-22,4,4,4,,,1,3,no,2,"  This entire flight was a disaster and Lufthansa's customer service dreadful. I originally booked in mid June to fly with Lufthansa to fly from LHR to LJU via FRA on Friday 8th July in Business Class. On 6th July they cancelled my flight from FRA to LJU. After many hours struggling with Lufthansa customer service and their useless chat-bot I finally managed to rearrange my flights for Saturday, arriving in Ljubljana at lunchtime. This meant I would miss part of the Congress itinerary, but the formal start wasn't until Monday. Then when I went to check in online on Friday my whole outward trip to LJU vanished! More hours on hold for LH customer services, including one memorable 2.5hr hold. Finally the managed to find flights for me on Saturday evening to Frankfurt arriving at 11pm and then onto Ljubljana at 9.00am the next day getting me at lunchtime. This meant that I would now miss two days. I got the flight at LHR, checking in two piece of hold baggage. I arrived at FRA and went to the hotel desk only to be told that the hotel I had been allocated was on the other side of Frankfurt. When I finally got there it turned out LH had sent lots of people there and the poor hotel staff were having difficulty checking so many people in near midnight. By the time I checked in it was midnight and the bar and the only food facility had closed. The next morning I returned to FRA to continue my flight. When I got on board I asked the flight attendant if she could check that my luggage had been loaded as there had been such a long delay between flights. She told me that the Load Master assured her it was. When I finally arrived in Ljubljana there was no sign of my luggage. I filled in the Property Irregularity Report and left for my hotel in Ljubljana. This was the Sunday and my luggage arrived on Wednesday evening at 11pm! During all this time LH's staff and useless lost luggage app were of no use at all. The level of service I received from Lufthansa was more akin to a two star airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Washington,Jul-22,2,2,2,2,,1,1,no,1,"  Traveling to Berlin: I flew from Washington, DC to Berlin Germany and had a very horrible experience. Lufthansa had bad communication and customer service during my journey to and from Berlin. When flying to Berlin, my second flight from Munich, Germany to Berlin was cancelled. I was never informed by Lufthansa that my flight was cancelled. A friend that I was traveling with told me that my flight was cancelled. The interesting is that his flight was automatically rebooked and mines wasn’t. I had to call customer service and get them to rebook my flight. Traveling to Washington, DC My friend and I found out when we were checking into our flights that we couldn’t check in because our flight could potentially be canceled. We later found out that it was cancelled due to employees striking. Once again, when they officially cancelled my friend flight, he was rebooked automatically with another airline. Lufthansa never rebooked my flight or contacted me to tell me my flight was cancelled. After trying to contact them all day, I finally got through and was only able to get my flight rebooked for two days after I was suppose to leave. So, I had to pay for a hotel room and stay in Berlin for an additional two days that I didn’t plan too. When flying back my flight from Frankfurt to Washington was delayed due to staff shortages. Once I finally get home I later find out that I can not be compensated or reimbursed for my hotel or food for the extra two days that I had to stay in Berlin. Apparently, I’m the EU passenger rights, strikes are considered unfortunate circumstances and you can’t be reimbursed. This was the worth experience ever and I will never fly with Lufthansa again. They are horrible!"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Frankfurt,Aug-22,1,1,,,,1,3,no,2," Manchester to Frankfurt. Lufthansa has rescheduled my flights twice only a few days before my flight. They offer you a refund if the times are inconvenient (at the original price). Finding a flight from another airline at this price would be impossible in August, which meant I had to take an expensive taxi (extra costs) to get me to the airport at dawn (inconvenience I made sure to avoid). Rude staff and unfriendly faces with a lack of flexibility. This is even worse for phone agents with incomprehensible accents, nonchalance and rudeness, not to mention the call gets cut a few minutes later, I've used Lufthansa twice already and never again! I'd rather use budget airlines."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Venice,Jul-22,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa has the worst customer service. Our flight was cancelled due to issues with the ground crew in Munich going on strike. I was there for Buisness and needed to get to Italy that day. I stood in the customer service line for 2 hours waiting for them to tell me they could not rebook me that day or the following day, they were also not able to issue a refund. I have contacted Lufthansa and Air Dolomiti who apparently ran the airline I was flying on despite booking with lufthansa. Lufthansa passed the refund ability to Air Dolomiti and Air Dolomiti has passed the refund ability back to Lufthansa. Lufthansa has made it impossible to get a refund even though the cancellation was at not fault of mine and they were not able to rebook me. I had to take a train instead. "

I requested Hindu NON-VEG but all the way to BLR I got potato in different form. Very outdated entertainment system and programs. Only USB charger available. Seats and pockets are filthy.

Very rude  staff."
Not Verified ,Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Vancouver to Frankfurt,Feb-22,4,5,4,3,5,1,1,no,3," Vancouver to Frankfurt. I do see a problem and a big hole with the company management. I never like to write bad reviews or complaints. The check in process in Vancouver was terrible as the agents are not familiar with the customer service standard at all. The boarding process was slow and delayed. The management were very unprofessional, giving me a negative attitude. The (staff) standard was low class. I would use the word cheap. A company training their ground staff to use cheap flirty tactics on valuable passengers. To me Lufthansa needs a change in managing and training their staff. However the inflight service was relatively ok and the seats were comfortable. The inflight service was ok as the fight attendants had done a good enough job to comfort their passengers. The staff in Frankfurt were ok but not overly impressive. The flight coming back was delayed but it was ok. Overall, I rate the service in Vancouver was unacceptable as it would be 2/10 but inflight was ok 8/10 and Frankfurt staff was 7/10. Good enough for my trip back. Lufthansa really need to upgrade and improve their service in Vancouver. I will be travelling a lot for my new career and I will be an important part of the world’s success going forward. I will be an important person to the country. I do not see Lufthansa as a company who tries to improve but rather a company who tries to hide from the truth. As the economy looms, I am very sure you CEO loves your stocks to grow. This management style does not work in the new generation. The style needs a change and the future of the company is in the hands of your employees."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Singapore via Frankfurt,Aug-22,2,2,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  I am a star alliance gold member. LH1019 BRU-FRA 29/07/22 was delayed by 2h45m. I knew I had, as a result, already missed LH778 FRA-SIN 29/07/22 before boarding LH1019 BRU-FRA 29/07/22. I raised this query with the staff at the gate and asked if I could be rebooked from Brussels. I was told that I had to take the flight to FRA and get rebooked there after arrival. Once aboard the airplane the captain informed us over the intercom that the plane had been running late all day. We arrived in FRA at 2330 where I was told that rebooking was not possible at that time and that I had to return to the airport the following day to get rebooked. I was given a taxi and hotel voucher. The hotel room stunk like cigarettes, cigarette burns were apparent, the bed was uncomfortable and the street noisy. I returned to the airport the following day at 0900 and waited in line for 5 hours to get to the rebooking counter where I was rebooked and checked-in on the similar route with flights departing the next day At that point my new expected time of arrival at final destination was 1505 on 02/08/22 – delay 50 hours I was not given access to my luggage as these were already checked-in. I was again given a taxi and hotel voucher. The room was unfortunately not air-conditioned. The heat made the night rather short. Hygiene amenities were not available. On 31/07/22 at 1530 I presented myself with my boarding pass to the check-in counter at FRA. I was told that the boarding pass was not valid anymore and that my entire booking had been canceled. The staff at the check in counter were unable to help me and I was again told to line up at the rebooking counter. There, after another 4-5 hour wait, I was told that my entire booking had been canceled by the computer system because it had considered me missing my initial connecting flights as a “no show”. In addition to canceling my booking the computer system had also surrendered the seats I had been rebooked on and these were now unavailable. I was then told that Lufthansa was unable to rebook me on a Lufthansa or star alliance flight for a period of at least 4-5 days. After further long delays I was offered a booking through Emirates and was told that that journey was my only option to get back to New Zealand. At this point, my new expected time of arrival at final destination was 1505 on 03/08/22 – delay 74 hours I was again given a taxi and hotel voucher and spent the night at tyet another hotel where air-conditioning was available but unfortunately broken! This made for another uncomfortable night. Again hygiene amenities were not available. On the 01/08/22 at 1300 I presented myself to the check in counter at FRA only to be told that my ticket was on stand-by. I was eventually provided a boarding pass for the flights but was made to pay 246 euro to have the extra piece of luggage, which was included in the initial Lufthansa ticket, carried to my final destination. Generally I thought the airline representatives were not taking responsibility for the inconvenience that I experienced as a result of the disorganisation. I barely got an apology and worse was made to feel that I was inconveniencing them. Furthermore I was plainly lied to multiple times. Avoid at all cost."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Palma,Jul-22,2,3,1,1,3,2,3,no,4," The worst experience this year. Lufthansa like many European airlines is declining in both services and facilities. Frankfurt airport is dirty and is not serviced most of the time, smells and is dirty as if there are no staff to clean it. The planes are never on a gate and always through buses and always a 10 min bus ride. I have been flying Lufthansa for the past 17 years and I wouldn’t use this airline or this airport unless I really have to."
✅ Trip Verified ,a320,Business,Business Class,Manchester to Brussels via Frankfurt,Jul-22,2,2,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  In the middle of the night 1.30am Lufthansa changed my original booked flight on Austrian one day later, no hotel accommodation offered, no possibility to connect with the airline. The number gave availability on weekdays so I had to pay for the airport hotel. The flight to Frankfurt caught quite some delay, despite plane stay overnight and everybody did notice the team on board did arrive quite late. Difficult boarding caused by a lot of oversized cabin luggage. In Frankfurt the plane was not on a gate, we had to wait at least 10 minutes for the stairs and the busses. Drawing attention to the connection FA told me there are enough flights to Brussels. It was a Sunday however so we missed the connection - the plane was not on the gate and already announced with at least 30min delay - a polite request to organise an extra bus was denied very abruptly. Then they sent us to 3 different counters even one outside the secured area to rebook flights - situation at Frankfurt airport was a disaster. Separate lines for business are not existing anymore. I had to fly to Berlin and from there to Brussels and on that flight I was downgraded ""no availability"" for business. Later it seems there were 2 free seats - I was dropped in the rear area of the economy. I will not dwell on the various services on board however it seems FA must serve drinks as little as possible. At Brussels my 2 suitcases were missing, one found 5 days later, the other sent from Berlin 36 days later. Lufthansa is not responding."
✅ Trip Verified ,Airbus A350-900,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt TO Washington,Jul-22,4,3,3,4,,1,2,no,3,"  The first problem our family of 4 had with our Lufthansa flights from Venice to Washington via Frankfurt occurred when we tried to check-in online the day before our scheduled flight. Unbeknownst to us, two of our family members had been bumped and were listed under an alternate confirmation number. Therefore, we had to rebook for the day after we should have flown. We are at a loss why they cancelled two of our seats in our original itinerary and why we were not informed. Things got worse as the plane was delayed leaving Venice the next day and we had to run to our connecting flight in Frankfurt. We would have been too late but luckily the flight from Frankfurt had been delayed an hour so we made it. However, our baggage was left behind. Not sure just how many people were in the same boat but when the luggage carousel stopped at Dulles, there were at least 30-40 people still waiting for their bags. Here we are, 18 days later, and only one of our four suitcases has made it home. Who knows where the rest are because Lufthansa doesn’t – despite there being luggage tags on each case. Customer support has been less than helpful during this time and we are still waiting for the many invoices we have submitted for replacement items to be paid. We understand staffing resource limitations is probably contributing to lack of response regarding our baggage, but when Lufthansa asks you if you’d like to check in your carry-on bags for free, say no!"

I used there Customer service app and requested call back and every time I talk to the agents I had to start over explaining my situation and every agent has a different suggestion.

Was coming from Frankfurt to St. Louis and I landed and none of my luggage came so we made a claim and they were still in Germany. We called multiple times no one picked, waited on the line for 30-40 minutes each time.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Toronto via Frankfurt,Dec-21,4,2,2,3,,1,2,no,1,"  I booked a two way ticket but my return flight got cancelled three times. They could not get me back home in time so I had to ask for a refund and book a new one way ticket with another airline. The first time, I received an email that my flight was cancelled, they didn't even rebook me and I had to call the hotline to rebook the ticket. I was in queue for a few hours and when it was my turn the customer agent was not very friendly. However, my new flight details were never sent to my email. I added on an extra baggage for my return flight but I was only allowed one check in baggage for the new flight. Because I didn't want to waste money on roaming calls, I used the live chat option on their website, of which they are even more unresponsive and I had to retry several times and wait a few hours before I got to chat with a live agent. This time, I rebooked to another (less ideal) flight but I didn't have a choice as I had to find my way home somehow. When it was less than 2 weeks away from my return flight, I got notified again that my flight got cancelled, they said that they were unable to rebook me on a flight anytime for the whole of July to the first few days of August. When I searched on the Lufthansa website to try and book a one way flight back home, I saw that they clearly had multiple flights back home with plenty of seats still available. However, the agent said that those flights were not accessible for me to rebook. At this point it was clear that Lufthansa did not respect me at all. Not only did they cancel my original flight back home, they did not allow me to rebook on similar flights, instead asking me to delay my flight back home by at least 2 weeks. I was so done with them and asked if they had an email which I can complain to, but there was none. in the end, I asked for refund (which I have still yet to receive) and booked a one way flight with another airline. Lufthansa gave me so much trouble, inconvenience and frustration during my holiday. on top of that, their customer service is so bad and some agents were rude and impatient too. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Oslo to Munich,Jun-22,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  On 20 Jun, my flight was cancelled and I was rebooked twice to different arrival locations and delayed over 4 hours in Oslo Airport with no meal voucher. After the delay, I was flown by Lufthansa to Munich and landed just before midnight. Because the flight was delayed I missed my connecting flight. Upon our plane landing in Munich, the pilot and flight attendant staff instructed us that there are no more flights until tomorrow and to go straight to the Lufthansa service desk to assist us due to our circumstances and missing connections. Once we exited the plane and got into the airport, the Lufthansa Munich service desk immediately made an intercom announcement stating that they are closing their service desk (regardless of a plane full of people just arriving off of a Lufthansa flight with nowhere to go) and told us that there are no hotel rooms available for us, no transportation, no meals and to sleep in the airport. They were very rude to us and would not answer any questions we had.  The service desk staff told us that they will not give us any new boarding passes or more information on backup plans, etc until 0600 the next morning. Over a hundred of us were left stranded after midnight in horrible conditions.  The only option I had at that point was to find a taxi to get me home. Bottom line: I refuse to be treated like an ill poverty-stricken, neglected and mistreated animal by Lufthansa. I understand that delays and cancellations can happen, however the treatment we received by the Lufthansa service desk staff in Munich was inhumane."

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Houston ,Jul-22,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,  Lufthansa doesn't care how it's customers are affected. This is nearly 20 days since I traveled with the airline and my 3bags never made to my destination. I contacted them all throughout and nobody cares. All they say is will call you when your bags are found. Can't believe I paid $350 excess baggage fees but my bags will never make it to me.  I also missed reporting to work due to a 24hrs delay arrival because they delayed to my connection and kept me in Germany for a day. Not even an email apologies or contact. Very poor services.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vilnius to Frankfurt via Halifax,Jul-22,3,3,3,1,1,3,1,no,1," I would like to share my horrible experience with Lufthansa during my flight from Vilnius to Halifax when I was left behind because the plane was overbooked, my luggage got lost and the refund for the cancelled flight was 80 USD instead of 611 USD. I have purchased the tickets Vilnius - Frankfurt-am-Main - Halifax with an 8 hours stop at Frankfurt Airport aiming to meet up with friends there and travel further to Canada. Though I checked-in 24 hours before departure it turned out that the flight LH889 was overbooked and app. 20 passengers incl. me were left behind. The airport personnel first asked us to proceed to the gate and wait until departure probably hoping (!) that some places will reveal themselves. But the miracle was not there and 20 unhappy passengers were asked to go to the airport workers to rebook their flights. After 1.5 hour waiting, fortunately, a Vilnius airport employee found a solution for me and managed to rebook the flight to Frankfurt via Amsterdam. So I had to stop at one more airport and spent in the air 2.5 + 1.5 hours (Vilnius - Amsterdam - Frankfurt / Main) instead of around 1 hour 10 min (Vilnius - Frankfurt/Main). I was acceptable as long as I was on time for my connecting flight to Halifax. But the next ""surprise"" was waiting for me in Halifax. My luggage did not arrive. I immediately filed a report at the airport and waited patiently a week as it was agreed with the lost&found service. Since then I regularly write complaints and emails to airports and Lufthansa and receive no feedback at all! Nobody answers the phone either. On top of all these circumstances I had to cancel my fully refundable return ticket due to personal reasons and was shocked by the refunded 80 USD instead of 611 USD. The bad part is that you do not received the responses on your emails or cannot reach Lufthansa workers on phone. I am deeply disappointed with the service and feel completely neglected as a customer. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Munich to San Francisco,Jul-22,3,2,1,4,1,1,1,no,1,"  This was the worst experience I’ve ever had with any airlines. From the start I noticed the unprofessional attitude of most of their staff from the ticket counter all the way to the flight attendants. They were short, impatient, and even rude with a body language showing that you were beneath them. Also, flight attendants would not respond to a seat call for as long as 30minutes. The food choices were awful and one of the most disgusting quality I have ever experienced. They lost our luggage and it took them 11 days to finally give it to us. Most ridiculous customer service especially in the lost baggage department. It also took us more than 10 tries and sometimes over an hour on hold to get a hold of somebody and then they would transfer you and have to hold again for an hour. The worst service ever. I was shocked how their service had deteriorated since the last time I flew with Lufthansa. So disappointing to say the least."

✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Basel to Salt Lake City via Frankfurt,Jul-22,2,1,2,2,,1,3,no,2,"  Wife and I traveled from Basel to Salt Lake City with connection in Frankfurt. Flew CRJ 900 from Basel to Frankfurt. Seated in front of exit row. No window and no recline seat. Good thing it was only a 1 hour flight. Frankfurt Airport was horrid. Bussed us from remote pad to A terminal. Then had to walk 3/4 mile through A to C terminal, but required to exit secure zone when left terminal A. There was two separate B terminal security lines which were at least 200 yards long. Figured lots of people would miss flights in that terminal The line for C terminal security took around 45 minutes. Although we had a connection time of 1.5 hours we barely made it through security to the C15 gate in time. When going through the boarding ticket scan I was told I had to pay for baggage which I had already paid on check in at Basel. Gate agent had no record of us paying for baggage which would have cost us another $100. I finally reasoned with gate agent that we had already checked bags in Basel and paid the fee in Basel so they finally waived the extra baggage fee. we boarded the plane exhausted and dehydrated from the walk. After walking as fast as we could From A to C, we did not have time to purchase any water because it would be discarded at security in C terminal. we were thinking we would get a bottle of water on the plane. Sat on ground after boarding for another 1/2 hour. No beverage service for at least 30 minutes after take off. No bottle of water, only a half full 6 oz plastic cup. And no ice. Servers skipped us twice during flight and only offered drink service 30 minutes after takeoff, during the meal two hours into flight and two additional times before the ""snack"" during the 11 hour flight. The snack before landing was two pieces of bread and a slice of white cheese. I had to ask the servers for some water twice after being skipped. Seats and legroom seemed smaller than those on Delta. Delta has 4 times as many entertainment selections. Arrived in Salt Lake City feeling dehydrated the entire flight. Overall a truly miserable flight experience. I will never go through Frankfort again if I can avoid it and will avoid Lufthansa at all costs."

Could only contact them via email no phone numbers where working and if they were working the people were rude to me. My bag has been lost 23 June and it's now 18 July. I had to go buy myself new clothing and toiletries etc. Now I receive an email that says my bag is on it's way to South Africa but I'm in Barcelona? They don't ask anything about the things I had to buy to just go on without my baggage. Now it's going to be a big struggle again to get them to send my baggage to Barcelona, and if we eventually manage to do that.  What about all the money I've spent on all the clothing and toiletries I had to buy? I will never use Lufthansa again. I understand that the baggage can get lost, but they way I was treated upsets me. I couldn't get hold of them and they don't give you feedback or communicate with you, so you're stressing all the time about your baggage and they just don't come back to you."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Washington,Jul-22,3,3,3,1,1,3,2,no,4,"  We were originally to fly TAP Portugal but a leg was cancelled so we were placed on Lufthansa to get from Zurich back home to Dulles. Already a long flight, it was delayed by over an hour to start. Staff were nice and efficient enough, but this plane is =lacking in amenities=. The touch screens were horribly slow and old, and staff said they were =out of wired earbuds. Meaning any of us with airpods were out of luck for the nine hour flight if you wanted to watch a movie. Meals were okay, but the cold sandwich (cheese and veggies) was not good. Our flight ended up being over 11 hours due to a detour in Philly because of thunderstorms. We had to sit on the tarmac while the plane was refueled. They did an okay job of keeping us updated, but none of us appreciated being alerted to the detour literally ten minutes before the detoured landing. All in all, this was a pretty miserable experience. Airlines totally have you at their mercy and this was a time where I certainly felt that.="
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vienna to Dublin via Frankfurt,Jul-22,5,5,5,,5,5,5,yes,10,"  My family and I were flying to Vienna to Dublin, and were worried that we were going to miss the connector flight in Frankfurt, as the Vienna flight was delayed for over 30 minutes, and the boarding gate in Frankfurt had been changed. As we took off the pilot announced that air traffic control in Frankfurt was monitoring our flight from Vienna as most of the passengers onboard had connecting flights and that we would all make our connecting flights on time. We landed in Frankfurt only 5 minutes late, and then the pilot announced that Lufthansa had transport waiting at the aircraft for us and two other passengers who were also flying to Dublin. A comfortable mini-bus transported us across the airport to a small police office where we had our passports checked, and then back onto the bus and driven across the tarmac to a remote departure gate that we would never have reached on time. We were then escorted to a lift/elevator by Lufthansa staff and into the departure lounge which was only about to board when we arrived. We all felt like VIP's but we were only traveling economy class, and I have never encountered this high level of efficiency and slickness on any other airline. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Vancouver,Jul-22,4,5,5,5,4,4,5,yes,9,"  This was my first time riding an A359. My wife and I had exit row seats which were tight but I appreciated the legroom for this long flight LH 476. Again typical German efficiency from the cabin crew, they provided excellent service. I was very surprised that no one from the cabin crew came to explain the function of the exit row, something I’m accustomed to with our US carriers. I’m no stranger to the exit row seats and my wife and I are capable of assisting passengers and opening exit door in the event of an emergency. Also the cabin crew should assess if passengers sitting in the exit row seats are able to function and assist other passengers. Food and beverage service was outstanding. We had a female pilot in the cockpit who did a superb job managing the aircraft and kept us abreast of all situations including delays, which we were delayed taking off and landing. It was a good flight, the A350 is a very nice aircraft. My only suggestion for the cabin crew is to insure passengers sitting in the exit row seats are able to open the emergency exit door and assist other passengers in the event of an emergency."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Munich,Jul-22,5,4,3,,,4,4,yes,8," Flight was quick, smooth, and comfortable. Cabin crew was professional with typical German efficiency. Was surprised that that my wife and I had to pay for tea, 3 euros each, especially with LH being one of the largest legacy carriers in Europe. The A321 was new and quite comfortable. We were late landing at Munich but thankfully we made our connection."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to Frankfurt,Jul-22,3,5,4,3,,4,4,yes,8,"  Flying with Lufthansa was a great experience. They served all of us with a nice glass of orange juice. Although we were not given headphones to use the inflight entertainment, we were able to stay entertained by our own devices. As soon as dinner came around, there were 2 options which were fried egg rice with chicken, or a pasta with cheese, tomatoes and other vegetables. The food was overall very good although I did not like a sweet and sour salad.  As we left the airplane and went passed the security gate, I had realized that I left my wallet on the pocket of my seat in the airplane and there was no way for me or my dad to get it back. We had to go through a minimum pain of contacting the service center and they were able to get us back the wallet in fast time. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Johannesburg to Toronto via Frankfurt,Jul-22,2,1,1,2,1,3,2,no,2,"  We recently had the misfortune to fly Lufthansa on 5 legs of an international trip. The booking class was in Premium Economy. Fortuitously - the 6th leg of the journey was on a code share partner Air Canada. The Air Canada experience was truly great and a marked contrast to the most disappointing Lufthansa flights . And the Lufthansa Premium Economy experience was a supreme disappointment. In fact - the entire Lufthansa experience was terrible. This starting on their website - in which I wrote a note querying some assistances required. Despite being promised an answer within 2 days, Lufthansa never bothered to acknowledge nor respond! On to the flights, the seating was pretty much the same as economy. And there appeared to be very few toilets on the plane, with access to all and sundry. The food was very poor. The drinks service was abysmal, one drink allowed  and that was it! No doubt Lufthansa on a cost saving program? Found the air hostesses to be less than helpful- and in some instances even rude. Lufthansa premium Economy is sold at a 50% premium to the normal Economy. This is in our opinion an absolute rip off. We most certainly will NOT be flying Lufthansa again. A huge all round disappointment!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Detroit to Cairo via Frankfurt,Jul-22,2,1,,,,1,1,no,1,  Very unprofessional and extremely rude staff. Under the American law when an airline is operated by another airline they should abide with the rules but Lufthansa ridiculously refused to let me take two bags while my reservation shown that I have to bags with no charge and they made me pay 200 dollars expenses for my 2nd bag. I tried to complain and they shut me down especially with an extremely rude staff at the Detroit airport with both supervisors being extremely rude and didn’t want to solve the problem. They even don’t answer the customer service phone line nor emails and no refund for all the inconvenience they caused especially with last minute cancellation of my return flight which delayed me about 2 weeks from my original date where they wanted to charge me the difference for it. I see lack of coordination between them and other airlines in addition in lots of inaccuracies within their system. I will never fly with Lufthansa again.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Stockholm to Frankfurt,Jul-22,3,3,3,3,,1,1,no,1,"  Absolutely terrible. Flights were booked months in advance but tickets were changed more times than I can count afterward - almost felt like I'd wasted my time looking for the most optimal departure times, layovers, etc. when I booked the tickets because my trips with Lufthansa all ended up nearly completely different from the original plan and it was so far in advance that it was certainly not something understandable like weather. Did things improve when the departure date actually arrived? No, absolutely not. Lufthansa's online check-in didn't work a single time for me (multiple flights on a round trip) and the queues to try to talk to a Lufthansa employee were absurd at every single airport in my journey. Which I know because I had to talk to someone at every airport to try to get my ticket sorted. It was honestly a relief that their delays caused me to miss one of my flights because the layovers that they rescheduled me to were so tight that I'd been running frantically from place to place trying to make connections. I could go on and on about every issue encountered with Lufthansa's inability to actually deliver the service I paid for but suffice to say that I will go out of my way to not fly Lufthansa again."

I upgraded to business class and my card was successfully charged only to find out at the airport that my upgrade didn't go through. After more than 1 hour with their customer service department, no explanation was provided, and they were only able to offer a refund. I'll never fly them again ."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Riyadh to Vancouver via Frankfurt,May-22,3,1,1,4,1,1,1,no,3,"  I had the worst experience booking through Lufthansa. First, I called the customer service to secure a bassinet seat for my infant, the agent has confirmed with me that the seat with bassinet is booked. On the flight day, when I boarded the plane, I was shocked that no bassinet seat was booked.  I complained to the flight attendant and I explained to her my case, she was like “I am sorry for this inconvenience, but I can’t help you.” . The second time when I booked with Lufthansa, the customer service agent has confirmed with me that my seat is booked. I called again for the second time to reconfirm with Lufthansa customer service, the Lufthansa customer agent assured me that my flight is reserved. When I went to the airport, at the counter, the flight agent informed me that my ticket wasn’t booked? When I asked how is that possible, they said the agent took my payment information, but he forgot to process. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Denver,Jul-22,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Arrived at the airport 3.5 hours before take off. Already checked- in, bag drop took 1.5 hours, security another 1 hour, and there is the random boarding pass checkpoint that took half and hour, then I’m late for my flight! I was still 10 mins before take off by the time I reached the gate. But there is no plane there because gate has changed and passengers are supposed to get on a bus and get to a different gate. The agent at the gate told me to go to customer service. I waited in line for 1.5 hours to see one. And she told me there is nothing she can do and she keeps pointing finger to the Frankfurt airport, to United airline (the airline that I get the ticket for a flight operate by Lufthansa), and to me! She did nothing but pointing finger. My resolution was calling United and United put me on their own flight tomorrow. And I’m still out of my own pocket for the hotel because United is not the cause for the delay. Then, I need to retrieve my checked bag and the Lufthansa agent told me to go to bag desk. When I reached Lufthansa bag desk they told me to go back up and talk to the check in counter. And the check in counter told me to go to the customer service center. The Lufthansa customer service center were full of people, then a Lufthansa agent came out and tried to talk people away. She closed the customer service center door and gave everyone a quick answer to the question. My question for her was where’s my checked bag since I’m now leaving tomorrow with another airline. She said Lufthansa has a system and the bag follows wherever I go. So I told her I am flying with another airline and how does that connect with the system of another airline. She said the system can do that but that’s definitely a lie because I have an United agent on the line when everything happens and she told me she cannot see the bag on United system. So the Lufthansa agent just shut the door, lie to people to their faces and intimidate you to make you walk away. I went to the check in Lufthansa counter again and ask where’s my luggage. This time the agent ask how come my luggage is not with me so I told her the whole story again and her comment was what happened to my us on TV everyday and it’s just me being late so I make all these excuses up. In the end, she did told me I need to go to the United counter to have my bag transfer to the United system. I cannot understand how can everyone from Lufthansa so unhelpful and incompetent. And they worst part is they lie so that you walk away and said something untrue to make you feel bad and think they are not the problem. When there is such a long wait at the airport, they need to send out notifications to remind people to come earlier than 3.5 hours, which is already a lot and more than expected. They did absolutely nothing to help but lies, pointing fingers, pushing you around. I would rather not go to the places Lufthansa fly to than taking Lufthansa again. "
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Antalya  to New York via Munich,Jul-22,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,no,1,"  My flight AYT-MUC-JFK was booked with Lufthansa. They used Sunexpress (another airline) as a carrier for the first leg AYT-MUC. Checked 3 pieces of luggage in AYT and was told to pick it up at JFK. Unfortunately, lost bag tags on the plane to MUC. 2 out of 3 pieces of luggage did not get to JFK and now Lufthansa is telling me that they only have 1 piece of luggage in the system and they have no way of looking up the tag numbers/luggage for the other two since it was operated by another carrier. Sunexpress is operating only in Europe while I am in the US and they don't respond to my requests. I would never fly with Lufthansa again. Stay away at any means possible."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Oslo to Olbia via Frankfurt,Jul-22,2,1,,,,1,1,no,1," This is the worst airline in Europe. Stay away. Arrogant, rude, and will hold planes for cruise ship passengers and let everyone else miss their flights. Travel voucher provided for a random hotel far from the airport, sent luggage to the wrong city and refused any vouchers for toiletries, no refund for anything we missed as a result of them delaying our flight to accommodate their cruise ship affiliates. We waited in line for hours with hundreds of other unfortunate Lufthansa customers. They refused to rebook our flight through a different city so we are stuck in transit for 30 some hours. I would rather pay double than ever fly this airline again."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Dublin via Frankfurt,Jul-22,4,4,3,,,1,1,no,2,"  Absolutely the worst airline possible and would not recommend a single aspect of it. Every flight was delayed, as a result we missed our final flight from Frankfurt to Dublin. We were given no direction or indication as to what to do. once we found a service desk we were handed taxi vouchers that were not accepted in Frankfurt. We arrived for our flight this morning only to be told the desk lied to us and our flight is not until tomorrow. They have not given us our bags, we have no clothes, no food vouchers, no accommodation for tonight. They have not even bothered to set us up with a direct flight tomorrow. The airline is an absolute disgrace i would not recommend anyone fly with them."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rio de Janeiro to Munich,Jul-22,1,4,1,3,4,4,3,no,3,  A ridiculous lack of space to accommodate passengers for intercontinental travels.

Nothing to complain about them. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Houston via Frankfurt,Jul-22,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  My flight from Brussels to Frankfurt, LH 7001, was delayed on 7/6/22. Had 45mins layover so couldn't make it on time to a far away connection gate at Frankfurt. No one told me to go to the service center to be rebooked. Walked the mile long from arrival to departing gate at z62 and asked an agent if I was at right gate and flight, she said yes. I asked I may be late if checking started, she said sit down you are here check in will start an hour later. After some time I asked again only to be told that flight departed and directing me to service center to be rebooked for next flight either 12pm or 2pm flight. This was another mile long walk. Ran to the service center only to find nearly 100 frustrating pax. Tired to get attention of customers service agent to explain situation only to be told join the queue. I begged that I will miss the next flights if I join but she hurriedly said to just join the line. By the time it was my turn, all flights to Houston have departed and was told have to spend a night in Frankfurt until next day flight. Thinking if I got delayed m, then my baggages will make it on time with me right, that was not the case. Came home empty handed, baggage left behind in Frankfurt or Brussels. Followed up with calls and no one can help. When you are lucky to get your call answered, the best bet if you will be told to call another number. Tried their Houston lost and found office and it took hours to get a call back. When I got a call back, I was told by the agent that I was talking to a supervisor who can help me but she too failed to call back to verify if my baggage arrived or not on the 7/8/22 flights. She said she was going to send a request to see if they can expedite the search which I am highly pessimistic she will do.  If you don't care about long delays, missing or delayed baggage, bad customer service, then go for it otherwise not the best to go for. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Split to Helsinki via Frankfurt,Jul-22,3,3,,,,1,1,no,1,"  A terrible experience. We missed our connecting flight because our first flight was delayed. We were totally unable to get any help in that situation. It was Late in the evening, and the next possible flight was departing the next day. We couldn't find any person who could have provided us accommodation or new flights. Our luggage was also lost, and the airline was unable to give us any information about the situation. Avoid this airline!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Athens to Atlanta via Frankfurt,Jul-22,1,2,1,1,2,1,2,no,2,"  Lufthansa Business Class is declining. I only booked it for the schedule/fare, but I wouldn't book again. I would rather spend more money for a better experience. The seats are horrible, cabin is cramped, food is subpar, and service lacking. For a long-haul product, there are so many other better options. The entertainment system looked like something out of 1995."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Toronto via Frankfurt,Jul-22,2,3,1,,,1,2,no,1,  I had a flight with Lufthansa from Istanbul to Frankfurt which got delayed from 1:55 pm to 3:25. Because of this delay I missed my Air Canada flight from Frankfurt to Toronto so I had to rebook another flight at Lufthansa service at Z14 in Frankfurt airport. I waited from 6:00 pm until 9:45 in the line to rebook another flight. When it was my turn the Lufthansa staff rebooked me a flight from Frankfurt to Montreal then to Toronto and this flight was at 2:10 in the next day. So I had to wait in Frankfurt for 20h for my next flight. The Lufthansa staff gave me voucher for food but told me that most of the restaurants are already closed because the time was close to 10:00 pm. Moreover he told me that he cannot book me a room at my cloud hotel in Frankfurt because the hotel has no rooms left for Lufthansa.  The staff gave me a pillow and a blanket and told me to rest somewhere on the airport. So I booked a room in My Cloud hotel on my expense.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,First Class,London to Delhi via Frankfurt,Jun-22,3,4,3,,,3,3,yes,7,"  I became very nervous about flying Lufthansa after reading all the recent reviews, but it was fine. The flights were pretty near on time and my luggage arrived with me. The short hop from London City was OK, apart from the nasty German sparkling wine that they call ""Champagne"". The much-vaunted first class terminal at Frankfurt was a disappointment. The first-class cabin to Delhi was painfully old-fashioned. Service was good. The food was acceptable. But this didn't feel like a first-class experience. It was pretty much in line with British Airways standards: OK but not great."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bahrain to Poznan via Frankfurt,Jun-22,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,no,1," Bahrain to Poznan via Frankfurt. Definitely not again. We travel with a baby less that 2 years and you know how much it is difficult to travel with a baby. The seat selection is a big challenge now and as all companies need to get the maximum of money from passenger we were not able to choose our seats if you do not pay - even with a baby. No problem, so we landed in Frankfurt and we got our baby stroller for the 5 hours of transit time for our baby. We then check-in the flight from Frankfurt to Poznan in Poland but at the gate they asked us to handover our baby stroller and saying that it it will be handle back to us as soon as we arrived in Poland at the exit of the flight. We didn't received any stroller and went directly to baggage claim to file a complain. We got a claim number and went to our hotel. We have been waiting for 5 days and no one contacted us, since we arrived we are trying to contact Lufthansa in Poznan Airport and the luggage claim department but no one answer. It is ridiculous and not acceptable. We will purchase another baby stroller but will keep Lufthansa responsible of this. It is really not nice to be ignored and treated the same way a low cost company will do. Where is the old Lufthansa with a proper service. Never again."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Dublin to Johannesburg via Frankfurt,Jun-22,3,2,,,,1,1,no,1," Dublin to Johannesburg via Frankfurt. Unkind, unprofessional and rude. Thanks to Lufthansa’s delay we missed the second leg of our trip resulting in losing a full day of our booked holiday. Lufthansa customer (no) care staff were rude unhelpful in finding the solution. On the way back from our holiday at the airport, at checking in, we were informed that our seats were cancelled. We were never informed about that prior to arriving to the airport. Imagine no explanation offered they cancelled our seats. Business class! No willingness to help on Lufthansa side. Terrible and stressful experience when you travel with children."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gothenburg to Frankfurt,Jul-22,4,3,,,,1,1,no,1,  Gothenburg to Frankfurt. My wife took this flight on July 1 from Gotenberg to Frankfurt. We checked in all bags which happened to be a big mistake. When she arrived at Frankfurt she wasn't able to find her bags because ground workers were on strike. All her medications were in one of the bag. A day later she was able to find her medications. Two days later she went to the airport and picked up the second bag from temporary storage area by herself. I want others to learn from this bad experience. Keep your bags with you or send it by FedEx or other means.
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Oslo,Jun-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Cancelled flight 1 hour before boarding and refused to provide any solution. Frankfurt airport's Lufthansa customer service was blocked by chains, angry airport staff and armed police only speaking German, creating an extremely hostile and threating situation. After 1 hour waiting they announced via the speaker that anyone with a cancelled flight have to deal with the situation on their own. Lufthansa was not willing to provide any support. All airport hotels was fully booked. I had to rebook the flight to the next day, arrange travel into Frankfurt and find an available hotel. The day after, on my way to the airport, I get a message via Lufthansa's mobile app stating that my flight has been cancelled. The app has also removed the boarding pass. Luckily I checked the details of the flight they claimed to be cancelled and realized that the flight number was incorrect. Well at the airport there is yet no Lufthansa support to be found so I printed a boarding pass at the self serving station. Finally at the gate, the personnel is 20 minutes late, boarding is late and we are stuck on the plane for close to one hour before final take off, all without any information, no excuses, no water etc. This is close to one week ago and Lufthansa has still not contacted me or offered any form of compensation. Knowing Lufthansa from many similar examples in the past, I will now have to sit in phone cue for 2 hours and later send several reminders and wait months and months to get any response. Most likely they will provide no compensation, as always."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Belgrade via Frankfurt,Jul-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  The flight from London was delayed by little over an hour, so it arrived in Frankfurt after our connecting flight to Belgrade had already departed. We were told by cabin crew to go to the service centre. Nobody there because it was after 10pm. We were told we could try rebooking our flight with the app or wait until the morning to speak to someone. Some 10 of us were on that flight to Belgrade and were given no accommodation, no food, water, nothing. We tried rebooking our flight through the app but kept being transferred to waiting lists. Nobody to speak to anywhere in the airport, the chat bot function unhelpful, the phone number saying to try again. We tried looking at other flights, trains, buses, but probably everyone had the same idea as flight prices were above 600€ and trains to Budapest and buses to Belgrade around 250€. So we are now lying down in a sofa at the airport waiting for 6am to speak to someone at the service centre but running a serious risk of being stranded in Frankfurt for days because all the options to leave are full or too expensive."

✅ Trip Verified ,A320-200,Business,Economy Class,Marseille to Bucharest via Frankfurt,Jul-22,4,1,,,,1,2,no,2,"  These flights were a nightmare, worst flights in the years. On Marseille airport there was a IT issue on the check in desk and therefore we were waiting a lot of time to be solved. On the first flight the cabin attendant forget to serve chocolate to several people including me. On arrival in Frankfurt we were blocked in the airplane for more than 30 min due to lack of people to maneuver the mobile stairs.. On Frankfurt airport remained in the bus more than 15 minutes because nobody answered from the plane.. Despite the fact that people were ready to fly on time the flight had 50 min delay due to lack of people to charge the luggage. Lufthansa became a very low quality flight company."

✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Bangkok,Jun-22,5,4,2,2,,4,3,no,7,"  This June I have flown to Czech Republic from Thailand with Lufthansa for a short trip. I will not review the short haul flight between Germany-Czech, because there is nothing to report. I will review the long haul flight Munich-Bangkok. The same review applies also to flight Bangkok Munich, but I lost the boarding pass already. First of all, check ins and boarding were sufficient and good even though the shortage of staff was visible. My main positives is the seat comfort and less noise in the aircraft. The seat was great to spend time in that long and the noise of the aircraft is much lower and therefore I enjoyed the journey very much. Staff attitude was ok. I was little surprised that have to pay for spirits, but I can understand this due to the current economic climate in the world. Mainly because i know that I paid far little money for the tickets then others. The main negative was the food. Please make sure that you eat well before travelling, because what you will get inside the plane is absolutely horrible. Overall experience is that it seems that Lufthansa became sort of a sausage factory.  Basically, get in the plane, smile couple times, get food, sleep and when landed get out. I got the flight ticket cheap, but next time I pay more if I wanna get better service with different airline."

When I asked whether Lufthansa could not release the ticket for DB Railways, I received the statement, no Lufthansa can offer alternative flights. Let the outbound flight lapse, bought a Oneway Railway Tix for € 199,00. The return flight was on schedule on 23.06. During the boarding process, the crew was again busy with themselves. Passengers were not greeted or without eye contact.I'm not a frequent flyer, but I've come to hate having to fly Lufthansa. A low-cost airline is friendlier and offers more service on board. Every low-cost airline offers me to buy a coffee on board against payment of a fee, Lufthansa did not."

There was no ground support in Frankfurt and when we arrived at the gate we were faced with ground staff that were rude, unwilling to help and more importantly not on top of the boarding process, allowing all classes to board at the same time and squeeze through two scanning machines. Upon arriving in Helsinki, we received an email from the airline stating our luggage didn't make it and they would keep us updated. The luggage arrived 30 hours later, leaving us with little choice but to do some shopping in the morning to cope with the cooler climate. 2 days later, on our return flight, we couldn't imagine things could go worst. This time our connecting airport was Munich and had several hours to kill. Upon arriving in Athens, we had to wait till all luggage was delivered to realise that one of ours didn't make it and file a missing luggage report. This was the 6th June. To-date, I have heard nothing from the airline. The online tool to monitor the luggage tracing delivers zero updates and lacks any functionality. A week after the luggage was missing, we filed a luggage irregularity report via the PDF form on Lufthansa's website but to my dismay, the ""send"" button refused to take any action. We emailed the airline's support to receive a reply 24 hours later, with some generic content, stating that we didn't provide all needed information. Since then, I have followed up once more and as expected received nothing back. Putting the luggage issues aside, the overall experience of their business class service was totally disappointing. The seats are economy seats with the middle row vacant,  food was mediocre and we were given the same menu on our return journey. "

I addressed a staffer behind a Lufthansa counter who rudely directed me towards a long line. I stood on line for over 45 minutes until a staffer attended me. She explained that I would be placed on a waiting list and would have to sit at the gate until 22.05 to be probably denied boarding. I had to argue forever until magically my boarding pass appeared. I was offered no voucher for refreshment. I asked if I could get access to a lounge as I was missing a meeting and was turned down. After receiving my boarding pass, I had to go again through security, standing in line for a long time, because I was attended outside the transit area. "

This airline has shown during last three years a massive deterioration. The cabin was cramped, crew in bad mood. I asked for a juice after the dinner was served and was told “the drink service is offered once”, so I asked if I could pay for it. The flight attendant went away visibly annoyed without saying anything. No breakfast was served. I don’t board a plane in order to fill my stomach with delicatessen but at least they should offer a small sandwich as a breakfast. I don’t recommend this airline."

I understand luggage can sometimes not make connecting flights but not being able to talk to anyone, on hold for 2 hours to talk to someone who in the end can't tell me anything different than what is online, get accurate and timely information, and the lack of anyone caring is unacceptable. My daughter will spend the next 5 weeks in Italy and Austria without her suitcase because it is now being sent back to the US and not delivered to her hotel as requested. Her trying to purchase items to replace what was lost is a nightmare. The bag arrived in Rome 4 hours later. She sat at the airport waiting, only to be told it hadn't arrived which in the end was wrong and that it was on the flight. We did not find this out until four days later when her dad was flying out of Dallas and decided to see if anyone there could help. We thought by some luck she could get her suitcase only to receive an email that same day that it was being sent back to the US. The other frustration was this was a United flight operated by Lufthansa. Would United help in any way? No. Disappointed in United and will think twice about using United but definitely will not fly Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vilnius to Frankfurt,Jun-22,5,5,,,,5,5,yes,9," This flight was 30 min late and this was emphasized both at the check-in counter and gates. It wasn't a big deal. The captain apologised in-flight and explained that the flight was late returning from Frankfurt. It was all fine. We were provided with a small bottle of water, a small chocolate bar, and an disinfecting wipe. Passengers were also assured that they would catch their connecting flights. An attendant walked down the aisle with a tablet to confirm flight statuses and gates with passengers in the later part of the journey. The flight was clean, comfortable, temperatures ambient and toilets tidy and well-stocked. Staff and attendants were friendly and professional - no complaints, except that I would have preferred better enforcement of the airline's own policy to use FFP2/3 masks onboard, and to have sanitizers available. Besides this, as have been my experience with Lufthansa a handful of times in the last decade - no frills, and suitably efficient."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Seoul via Frankfurt,Jun-22,1,5,1,4,1,5,2,no,2,"  The worst meal I ever had on a plane! We had a 13 hour flight and they offered us one meal with overcooked pasta and ketchup instead of tomato sauce, one tiny kit Kat and one mediocre sandwich! I have been using the airline for many many years and they always offered 2 meals and a sandwich and the meals always had a vegetarian and non vegetarian option. Now it was only overboiled pasta with ketchup! Also there is no legroom for a person over 1,50m!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Sarajevo via Frankfurt,Jun-22,4,3,1,4,3,4,3,yes,6,"  Food was disgusting and pasta only. Breakfast was worse, only a muffin. I was expecting more from Lufthansa. This way you guys hurt the reputation of airline."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Florence to Boston via Munich,Jun-22,2,2,4,4,4,1,4,no,1," The worst experience I have ever had with an airline. Lufthansa does not have post customer service. My suitcase and that of 8 more passengers who came from Florence to the United States have not yet received our suitcases, we made the claim report and when we check the tracking it always says to try again later, we call Air Dolomiti in Italy and they say that We must communicate with Lufthansa, in the Munich Germany office, which was where 2 friends and I made a stopover, they never answer and in Boston they say that we must continue checking on the internet and that they do not know where the suitcases are. I do not recommend this airline, they are very irresponsible And they have no regard for the frustration of their customers."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Rome,May-22,2,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  All of our luggage was lost on our way to a cruise. We were given a sheet of paper (written in German) by one of the rudest women I have ever met. The number on the sheet of paper did not work and the rest of the paper was pretty useless. Lufthansa would send periodic emails about our luggage over the next few days with conflicting information. We had someone in the states, someone on the ship and my husband and I continually trying to contact them, to actually talk to a person, to no avail. After several hours on hold, the cruise representative was able to talk with someone one time, but they were no help - they just passed the responsibility on to someone else. And then, one day, Lufthansa apparently just gave up - no more emails. We had to hire someone in Greece to locate and find our luggage. We were without it the entire trip - 10 days. I have tried repeatedly over the last month to contact them and to file a claim, but again, absolutely zero contact except for one automated email response. "
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,,Jun-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Just 4 short years ago I flew on Lufthansa. I had no issues on my flight to Switzerland, the food was decent (as far as airplane food goes) and I was fairly comfortable (as far as the seating goes). I checked in no problem and well you got me to my point of destination with relative ease, my my my, how that has changed. This airline has made my life living hell in just 24 hours. They have screwed me not once, not twice, but about a million times over. Let's break it down. I am going to start with their website. The website is absolutely appalling in terms of navigation, to find any information on the website, you must navigate the entire website dictionary. Not to mention the pages upon pages of useless code (meaning the pages don't work). I will save you some time by giving you a few pages that don't work - The Baggage Calculator, The COVID 19 Related Documents Uploading Page, The login and Sign Up pages, and a ton of the characters and typography. All I can say is whoever is doing the code for the Lufthansa website needs to fired. Let's move on to baggage. For a long-haul flight, I feel like a personal item (a purse or backpack), a carry-on item (a small bag), and a checked bag are acceptable, especially considering the flight was $1,500 USD. But no. Not on Lufthansa, you have to shove everything you need for a 10-hour flight into a single carry-on bag that must weigh under 8kg. I work with technology for a living and what I need for my job alone weighs 8kg. Unfortunately, I will not be able to pack everything I need for the next 2 years into two bags, so I looked for how much it will cost to take 3 bags. There is not a dang thing on the website on how much it costs to check another bag. So I call Lufthansa. Nothing. So I call again. I could not get a hold of any operator or person even within the business hours, nor would they let me wait on the phone for someone. No contact, how convenient Lufthansa. Website flaw, maybe, customer service flaw, absolutely. It is now just 22 hours away from my flight. I currently live 2 hours away from the airport and can I check in for my flight online...nope, I have to check-in at the airport conveniently located nowhere near me. Oh and just so you are aware, the Lufthansa check-in page doesn't work either. All in all, I would not wish this kind of stress on my worst enemy and lord do I hope that you the customer are not flying on Lufthansa because you won't even be able to check-in for your flight. The worst part is, I haven't even gotten on the plane and I have read bad review after bad review on the actual service and food, so that might be another review coming soon. Pray for free alcohol so I can forget my Lufthansa experience or just don't fly Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Boston to Barcelona via Frankfurt ,May-22,3,4,3,4,,1,1,no,2,"  I paid thousands of dollars to fly Business Class from Boston to Barcelona via Frankfurt. Our plane was delayed leaving Boston for an unspecified reason. We were more than an hour late arriving in Frankfurt yet there was not a single Lufthansa employee meeting the flight to assist with connections. The gate where we arrived wasn't even within sight of any airport monitors to check for connecting flight information. My connecting flight had already departed by the time I found the gate. It is just mind-boggling to fly into an airline's home airport on a delayed flight and not have anyone to assist passengers with connections. I found a help desk that booked me on a later flight several hours later. I wrote to Lufthansa to make them aware of my bad experience on May 11. I provided copies of my ticket, boarding passes and reservation. Several days later I got a response from Lufthansa asking for most of the passenger and flight information I provided in the initial email, so I replied again giving them the exact same information that I'd already provided once. It's now been more than 5 weeks and I've still not gotten a response."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Bucharest via Frankfurt,Jun-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," I couldn't even fly, I had to cancel my entire trip. When I got to the airport I wasn't allowed to check-in because the flight was overbooked by at least 20 people. How is this possible? Is flying the type of activity that works as a ""first come first serve business""? When I called customer service - nothing, everyone was acting like this is just normal and cancelling people plans is ok, and they can just give you a refund and everything is fine. Who is paying for lost time, emotional distress, cancelled plans, booked hotels, car rentals? This is just unacceptable, something should be done about it."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Ljubljana to Frankfurt,Jun-22,2,2,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa canceled half of my return trip (Frankfurt to Amsterdam) two days before we left and wished us Welcome on board with that. Now i am waiting in line at customer service for 20 minutes without any idea how long it will take, to beg for a refund of money that should have been returned to me automatically and that doesn't even cover half of the costs of the train ticket i had to buy. Not even talking about the extra hours of travel here."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bucharest via Frankfurt,Jun-22,2,2,1,2,,2,2,no,1,"  Still waiting for our luggage On the 9th of June we, have flown with Lufthansa from Sydney to Bucharest stopping in Singapore and Frankfurt. On arrival in Bucharest one of our luggage failed to arrive in Bucharest. After a 27 hour flight, we had to waste another three hours at the airport to queue to register the lost baggage.  While in the lost luggage office, we received an email from Lufthansa saying that the luggage was delayed and will be dispatched to us at an address of our convenience. They gave us the tracking number and we filled the forwarding address for the luggage. But then after 3 days, the tracking stopped without notice and we lost the trace of our luggage. Last it was seen in Frankfurt we believe. Now, there is no one to contact and the lost luggage office in Bucharest states that there is not much they can do. They advised us to wait and call them everyday. But this hope for the best approach is not what we expected from a company like Lufthansa. We could not believe that we have these problems with such a reputed company as Lufthansa. Now we are afraid we'll have the same problems on our way back to Sydney."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to St Louis,Jun-22,3,2,1,1,2,2,2,no,2," Frankfurt to St Louis. I have been a Senator Member of Lufthansa since many years and always enjoyed a fantastic service. However, since last year the service level has nose dived, be it the ground staff or the cabin attendants. Everybody seems to be in a foul mood always and absolutely not bothered to make the flying experience of its passengers pleasant. In my last flight from Frankfurt to St Louis the quality of the food was pathetic to say the least. It seems the quality of food that was served earlier to Economy class is now being served to Premium Economy. The Economy Class food is not up to the mark of Lufthansa level. Last year I had a very unpleasant experience at Valencia airport while travelling to Dubai and I couldn't fly. I had to buy an Emirates flight as an alternate as it was an urgent journey and I was more than surprised with the excellent service and the quality of the flight. I wrote about the unpleasant experience while checking in at Valencia to the Customer Service in Lufthansa and never heard back anything from them. I think it is the time to ditch my fidelity to Miles and More and look for an alternate if the service levels are not improved."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Florence to New York via Frankfurt,Jun-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  My original flight from Florence was delayed so I missed my connecting flight in Frankfurt (which I know they couldn’t do anything about it). However, once we got there after waiting in a 35 minute line for customer service, we were simply told this is the wrong line and to walk “that way” toward the double doors. In an airport that big, you think they could give better directions but no. Then once again, we asked for more directions and their ambiguity of directions appalled me. However, after searching for the “correct” customer service for half an hour, with little to no help from anyone we found it. They were very accommodating and put us up in a hotel 20 min away from the hotel free of charge. However, we asked if we could get our luggage so we could have our change of clothes, our toiletries, etc, and they weren’t able to do anything because “they were already headed to our final destination” which I would have understood. However, as I landed in New York this morning I received a text message that my bag couldn’t be loaded on schedule, which leaves the question as to why I couldn’t get it in the first place. I was flying home for a surgery for a fractured jaw so I thought Lufthansa would be a bit more accommodating due to that fact, but no. Not at all. So I am now left with no contacts, no toiletries, no clothes and the hassle of having to reschedule doctor appointments and surgery. On top of this, my TV wasn’t working on this 9 hour flight and after telling them about this, they didn’t do anything to try and fix it or accommodate me. I will never fly this airline again and hope no one else will either."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320 / Embraer,Business,Economy Class,Lyon to Nuremberg via Frankfurt,Jun-22,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  My worst experience with any airline by far. Of the 4 flights on my round trip all 4 were delayed, and my luggage was lost both ways. On arrival at Frankfurt there was no personnel to disembark us so we were stuck for a half hour on the plane which almost made us miss our connecting flight. The first return flight was late, of course, so we had to sprint in Frankfurt airport not to miss our connecting flight. I arrived on Friday evening, it is now Sunday and my luggage still hasn't been delivered, so not only was my trip an absolute mess but I've had to spend my weekend at home waiting for my luggage. Any information pertaining to the delivery I've had to go fishing for myself calling any number I could find, and the least I can say is that they were hardly helpful at all. I won't be flying with Lufthansa again if I can help it, they seem to be in control of nothing which is not reassuring at all. "
Not Verified ,A321-201,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Manchester,Jun-22,1,4,4,,,5,4,no,3,"  Flew back from Munich and everything was fine. Service better than the outbound leg to Frankfurt and on to Cairo, however, was very disappointed in the seat pitch and struggled to get in a relaxed and comfortable position. Have had more room on charter flights, and even Ryanair is more spacious! I would choose Lufthansa again for this reason, and I know it was only a short haul flight, however, had it been mid or long haul, itwould have been horrendous. So until Lufthansa increase there seat pitch, I will not use them again."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to London,Jun-22,2,3,1,1,1,2,2,no,2," Frankfurt to London. The seats weren't that comfortable. That service was mediocre, and my baggage was delayed for more than 30 hours, and they claimed no responsibility. I am very disappointed!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Milan to Madrid via Munich,Jun-22,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,2,"  I do t know why or what is going on with Lufthansa, but they are absolutely the worst. Delays, lost baggage, and they are just unable to deliver what they promise."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Copenhagen to Cancun via Frankfurt,May-22,2,2,1,1,1,2,1,no,4,"  The service from Lufthansa is below standard. If you call the service desk, they are never able to assist. The app is also not of assistance. If you want to upgrade your seats, the service desk is not able to assist or they claim everything is sold out but ask people to keep an eye for availabilities. We naturally did this, and last minute upgraded our seats, only to realize that they sell it nearly for free in the airport - this to advise that we tried to upgrade to business via phone but was told that it was sold out. In the airport they sold business cheaper than we had bought premium economy seats at the day before. Business was nearly empty on the flight and we were not allowed to upgrade in the airport, despite wanting to pay for same, as you can only upgrade once. When boarding we were shocked to see the seats, as the pictures of the class on their web is absolutely not picturing what you actually get. On the return flight, we again wanted to upgrade, as one of the ticket holders got injured and upgraded to business by the insurance company. We managed to upgrade the rest of us to prem eco only to find out, than in 3 weeks they had removed the ""all incl"" in the prem eco, hence limited avails of the drinks (both soft and alch). This wasn't even mentioned while being upgraded. Entertainment on board is very limited or not working. Very few movies, games platform not working at any of the flights and the wifi was not working on any of the flights. The food back from Mexico was not edible - and we are really not having high thoughts for food on board a flight - but when you pay a fortune to get food on board, then you should at least be served food which is being well cooked in order to eat it. Pancakes served for breakfast was not even fried enough to be able to eat it. Lufthansa is a very expensive low class company, which take money for everything without delivering the services paid for. This may have been the last time flying with them - at least alternatives are to be found now for our long haul flights."
Not Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Bangkok to Munich,Jun-22,4,4,4,5,3,5,5,yes,9,"  Flawless on the ground in Bangkok, fast check in no issues. Electronic gate updates and baggage receipts are useful. Efficient boarding and the aircraft was immaculate. The seating is 2-3-2 only three rows of Premium Economy behind the business cabin. Pre departure drink and a menu. Seat is roomy, plenty of legroom it’s comfortable and it properly reclines. Service is on China, and you get a choice. Which you often don’t with Lufthansa in economy. IFE screen is large and responsive. Good, busy and pleasant crew, It’s a nice product and good value for money on a sector over 8 hours, had some decent rest for a change. On time and overall very impressive."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Business,Premium Economy,Munich to Chicago,Jun-22,4,3,3,,,4,3,yes,7," Flight from Munich to Chicago in Premium Economy. The flight was uneventful, but it was a good way to cross the Atlantic. Lufthansa's Premium Economy seats are comfortable, especially on daytime flights. The service was decent, even though the crew could have served drinks more proactively during the trip. The food was fine, in particular, the snack before arrival was surprisingly tasty. If the price is right, I can definitely recommend Lufthansa's Premium Economy."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Atlanta to Athens via Frankfurt,Jun-22,2,1,1,1,1,1,4,no,2,"  Flight got us to destination, and the price was right. However, both flights were delayed, service on transatlantic leg was extremely poor. Inflight entertainment kept freezing, amenity kit is pathetic, and they literally seemed to go out of their way to not offer more than they had to. The flight to Athens, we actually got more service than the transatlantic flight. If you just want room and a fare conscious, then this a good deal. If you prefer better service, I would book Delta."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Rennes via Frankfurt,Jun-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Worst experience ever. After knowing that I'd miss my first flight from Munich to Frankfurt, I tried to call them to let them know I could not make it. It was impossible to reach them. Coming from Nuremberg, I still go to Frankfurt by ICE for my 2nd flight, Frankfurt - Rennes. What a nice surprise: impossible for me to board the flight. They just cancelled my ticket without notifying me. Of course, they would not hear anything or try to find a solution. ""We're sorry"" was all they could say. The return flight from Rennes to Frankfurt on June 18th? Also cancelled. The worst is yet to come: the client service is incredibly bad. No one can give me a precise answer or find a solution. No rebooking or refund is being made. They told me the ""no-show"" is automatically cancelling the other flights, but why not put it clearly somewhere? Why not send an email? I just lost around 420 euros. But don't worry: even though they don't want to bother find any solution, they still take the money and make you wait for hours because they are understaffed."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300 / A3321-100,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Vilnius via Frankfurt,Jun-22,3,1,1,1,,3,1,no,3,"  I read lot of reviews here unfortunately after my trip. If I read it earlier I would never take the flight with Lufthansa. I agree with passengers saying Lufthansa is cutting costs serving no or less food and drinks. It looks like Ryanair. On a flight from Dubai the first service was a small sandwich, cold and chewy. For drinks they offered some juices, water, wine. The morning omelette was more or less ok, tomato near raw and cold, piece of bread was hard to bite. Also staff were very rude to me. If you ask passengers to wear masks everybody make sure your mask is put properly, not hanging below your nose. In Frankfurt the flight was delayed and service was 1 bottle of water and a small chocolate. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A321neo,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Oslo to Frankfurt,Jun-22,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,2,"  The flight on Lufthansa regional business was an overall disappointment. The flight was delayed by a total of 1 hour, leading to a missed connection in Frankfurt. When boarding commenced in Oslo, no dedicated priority boarding was given, there were also no announcements for preboarding disabled flyers or families with small children. Once onboard, staff did not greet us, but directly inquired about the seat row. We found the seat area in business class poorly cleaned and with visible traces of spilled drinks from the previous flight. No welcome drink was served, as is usually the case on Lufthansa. Once airborne, we were served a sausage salad, which was one of the most appalling airline meals I’ve ever had. As dessert we were offered an apple in a paper bag, which we declined. Drinks were served out of synch with the food - here as well the service standards were poor, as all drinks were served lukewarm (including the sparkling wine). We were glad to part with Lufthansa once we landed and will not return as value for money is simply poor and below that of other European airlines."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Marseille to Manchester via Frankfurt,Jun-22,2,1,,,,1,1,no,1,  The worst flying experience I have ever had. Our flight from Marseille was delayed by an hour and a half meaning we missed our connecting flight to Manchester by 10 minutes. Absolute mess on arrival to Frankfurt with massive queues to book hotels and substitute flights. We could not collect our luggage at Frankfurt airport (as we were told its in Frankfurt) so were left without possessions for 2 days after arrival (until we could get another connecting flight.) Very poor service in air and on ground and would not recommend this airline to anyone. Very unprofessional and could not be more disappointed with the service and experience we received.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Bologna via Frankfurt,Jun-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,2,"  Bad experience! Our return flight was canceled, they scheduled us a new flight for the next morning, but it was canceled too. At the moment we have been at the airport in Berlin for 3 hours without knowing if we will be able to go home. Never again!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Munich to Washington,Jun-22,4,5,4,3,3,1,3,yes,5," Inflight service and comfort was fine as has been my experience with Lufthansa before. However, the Lufthansa ground crew experience at Munich Airport was beyond horrible this trip, it was utterly unacceptable on so many levels it's hard to know where to begin. Total chaos, lack of any attempt at communication from staff, miserable logistics at gate and on shuttle to plane, etc. I'm a veteran air traveller both domestically and internationally, and I've never seen such a mess. Passengers were so furious, panicky, and upset that in-flight crew kept apologizing and saying it wasn't their fault once we got on board, a miserably handled boarding process I might add that had people trying to get past each other in opposite directions. Lufthansa should be ashamed."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Family Leisure,Business Class,Brussels to Frankfurt,May-22,2,4,1,2,,3,2,no,4,"  Worst business class seats and food that I’ve experienced in a long time. No dining or wine menu. Food only slightly better than coach. Wines cheap and rough. Staff was great, so friendly. I will avoid this airline as much as possible. Business class lite not worth the price paid."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320-NEO,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Hamburg,Jun-22,5,5,5,,,5,5,yes,10,"  This was the best 45 minute flight I’ve taken. The plane was only a year old, we had service during this short flight, water and a chocolate bar. We left on time and all was perfect. My favorite airline by far."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Business,Premium Economy,Philadelphia to Frankfurt,Jun-22,5,5,5,5,,5,5,yes,10,"  This is my first trip back to Europe since the pandemic started and I was thrilled to fly Lufthansa. I upgraded to premium economy and I chose the first row behind business class as it has a little bit more legroom than the rest of the premium economy rows. It was a superb flight, with excellent service, meals served in China, silverware, glass, we left on time, no turbulence for the almost 8 hour flight. After having flown on US carriers for the past 2 1/2 years, this eight hour trip on Lufthansa was spectacular!"
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Berlin to Chicago,May-22,3,3,1,1,,1,1,no,1,"  I was forced to check my carry-on suitcase because Lufthansa overbooked the flight. The luggage did not make the connection (because the first flight was delayed). The suitcase got shipped with the next flight to Chicago. It is now two weeks and the suitcase is not found. I concluded my trip and I am back home. Customer Service is absolutely useless. I manage to talk to 3 different people and they all told me 3 different things. The only way to get a prompt reply is via their twitter account. They also have the courage to say that they will only refund 50% for clothing or durable items, which is insane because I had all of my nice, hemmed, business clothes. Why should I pay 50% for something I would not need if Lufthansa did their job properly. "
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to Tokyo via Frankfurt,May-22,4,3,1,2,,4,2,no,5,"  My return leg from Johannesburg to Tokyo on Swiss had been cancelled and I was put on a Lufthansa flight. The flight was OK but i really felt the food and drink situation was terrible. Johannesburg to Frankfurt was about 10 hours. The first meal consisted of a salad of carrot, squash and aubergine, a roll, a cake with raisins, and a dry pasta with some tomato sauce. Initially, I thought that as the plane was full and I was at the back of the plane that this was the left over option. It transpires that there is only one option and it is vegetarian which doesn't bother me but might others. The pasta was pretty horrible and really felt like something a student might make. Just past and a bit of tomato sauce. the salad was small and bland. The roll and cake were fine. The second meal (breakfast) was a yoghurt a cereal bar and a dry sandwich (also vegetarian). Beer and wine are complimentary but spirits are not and come in at about 7 euros. No snacks or nuts with the drink service though you can buy them. The seat was fine, the entertainment system was difficult to use and had an average selection. The second flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo Haneda which was around 15 hours due to closed Russian airspace was in airbus. The plane was new and clean and the entertainment system was easier to operate. However the food and drink situation was the same. In fact the same nasty pasta was served this time accompanied by a couple of chopped up lettuce leaves. breakfast was the same too. I really felt that for 15 hours on a plane there wasn't much food. I understand that times are tough for the airline industry and that probably Lufthansa are cutting costs with the food and drink service but times are tough for the passenger too and being fed not very much and of poor quality on two different transcontinental flights is a poor showing especially on what is supposed to be a premium airlines."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hamburg to Sofia via Frankfurt,Jun-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  By far the worst experience I ever had flying with an airline. Unfriendly staff in the Hamburg airport. The flight was delay with few hours and as result I have lost the connection to Sofia. After 5 hours of staying in line for their service, I was told that Lufthansa is not obliged to give vouchers for accommodation and transfer due to their fault. In turn I would have to pay everything myself and have the possibility to invoice them to Lufthansa. Very disappointed. "
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Alicante,May-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Dealing with their customer service has been a nightmare...to say the least! We initially tried to book through Air Canada with this flight, but were informed that as we are travelling with a pet we need to call Lufthansa directly. Everything seemed fine and I gave my debit card details to the operator and was told I'd receive my booking confirmation within 72hrs. After 1 week I didn't receive anything, so I called again and this operation took my card information as if he was booking me another ticket, again I was assured I will receive the booking confirmation within 72hrs. Another week passes and I've received nothing (we can all see the pattern here!), so I call again. This operator told me that the payment couldn't go through as it was a Visa Debit card, so my partner gave her credit card and the payment went through in the time frame or so we thought! We still haven't received a confirmation for our pet in cabin. We call again (several times) to get a confirmation that our pet would be joining us on the flight, we were given 4 different responses, but always promised the confirmation will arrive by tomorrow or 48hrs or 72hrs (depending on who we spoke to). One month passes by and we give up and decide to leave it up to chance arriving with our pet at the airport with the hopes we can take him. But it doesn't end there, about 1.5 months after booking our flights I receive another booking confirmation email for the same flight and the price was taken from my account. So I call and cancel that flight and received a refund of the full amount. I know what your thinking ""It must end here!"", think again. On the day I received my refund I had two more transactions taken from my account, totaling the amount that I was just refunded! In our preparation to move to another continent, I had missed these transactions coming from my account. So the night before my flight, as I was checking in, I noticed and I called explaining my story to the operator, she was no help at all as we were trying to figure out this issue. The call then dropped. Calling back again I got another operator and at this point I wanted to speak to someone with more knowledge, so I asked for the manager. He told me this isn't possible and that he can help me, I expressed that I have called about a dozen times to simply get a flight for 2 people and a pet, I've been booked on the same flight twice and charged three times. At this point I just wanted to speak to someone with a bit more experience. I was put on hold and told it wasn't possible for him to do that, but he did direct me to their website to request a refund, (I mean come on, that's the best you can do, submit a refund for a flight that I've already cancelled?). I thank him for and submit the form, but there was nowhere to upload the documents. So I called again, explained the situation to another person and I was giving an email to send my bank statements to and now I wait! But all in all, this experience with Lufthansa left such a bad taste in my mouth that the whole experience was horrible. There will not be a next time. I will update this review with a result, if there is one."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Tel Aviv-Yafo,May-22,3,5,2,,,5,4,yes,7," LH684 from MUC to TLV. I was late due to a delay on a connecting flight but due to the very professional organisation of the ground staff at MUC, I was still able to make it just in time. The flight had a delay of 30 minutes. Dinner consisted of a small (and for the duration of this evening flight) very inadequate cheese sandwich. On the other hand, beverage service was very good and they made four rounds on this 3.5 hour flight. The crew were very friendly and well organised. If you have time to grab a bite to eat at the airport before your flight, Lufthansa is certainly a good choice on this route."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Business,Economy Class,Prague to Kuwait via Frankfurt,May-22,1,1,1,4,,1,1,no,1,"  PRG-FRA-KWI and back RUH-FRA-PRA. Both short legs typical European feeder flights with zero frills. Also both flights delayed, and on inbound flight back to PRG constant chatting of flight attendents in the back galley.  Flights to KWI and back from RUH real disaster. Cabin staff inattentive, they do not react to the bell. Food uneatable Or without spices or overspiced. Food not being served even 90min after take off. V On the night flight back to FRA from RUH stewardesses demanded us to lower the window shade.  On flight to KWI my suitcase got lost.  Application that should enable tracking didn't work, tried to insert data 4 times, it kept reporting that data I entered is not valid. Nobody cared to inform me when suitcase finally arrived neither to offer help with pick up delivery etc. I will try to avoid them at any cost."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Casablanca to Frankfurt via Hannover,May-22,3,2,1,1,,1,1,no,2," My flight got delayed from Casablanca to Frankfurt, so I missed my connection, supposed to be at 7.00am. I then get rebooked for the flight at 9.00 and wait patiently for 2 hours at the gate but then surprise surprise: they are not sure I can get on board because it is full and will need to wait until 13.00. Service on board as well is horrible. I would recommend any other airline unfortunately."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Budapest via Frankfurt,May-22,3,1,2,1,,1,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa's service tragically deteriorated since covid. The ground staff is utterly incompetent, the check-in agent was clueless, she failed to tag one of the bags as we later found out. The flight crew was extremely unhelpful and made the travel with young kids very uneasy and stressful. They do not use words like please or sorry, but there seem to be a new random ""law"" every other second. When we actually needed something they did not show for an hour. Upon arrival, 2 of the 5 bags were missing. Two days later, one of them was delivered but 1us still missing. The international call center is extremely unhelpful, everybody is rude and clueless."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to İzmir via Frankfurt,May-22,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,no,1," The airline with the worst customer service in the world. When checking in online from Los Angeles, the system asked me if you would like to upgrade to business class. I made the mistake of admitting it. I upgraded for 2 people. My wife's ticket was upgraded and she got her seat number, but I didn't get mine. I saw the charge was already taken from my bank credit card for both of us. I called customer service, after a long wait, they answered. The Philippine call center said it wasn't an upgrade for me, it was just for my wife. I checked many times and I saw that they took money out from my bank. I ask him we don't want to fly separate so to return my wife's ticket to its original purchasing and refund the money, they said it was not possible. 50 minutes spent over the phone for nothing. I called again, another agent was completely ignorant, same story but this time she said my wife's ticket was not upgraded either. I said she was wrong, even though I stated that I had a computer printout and I got the Seat number. 1 hour and 10 minutes waste of time. I called for the third time, I didn't give up. This time a new agent told me my wife's ticket was upgraded and to just go to check-in, don't worry, she said everything is fine. I hung up the phone, I didn't spend time for my ticket so I can handle mine at the airport. 45 minutes. I didn't feel comfortable, so I thought I'd check one last time before going to bed. Unfortunately, the seat number has changed again and it has become economy class. I called again, 48 minute wait. Inconclusive. By the way, every time I called, when I wanted to talk to the manager, they said that they were not available they are helping customers, I asked them who am I? I think I am also a customer. Please stay away from this airline, don't put yourself at risk."

Good luck getting a refund. If it was possible to score them low on customer experience I'll say minus infinity. It is a shame customers still have to rely on their service. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Beirut via Frankfurt,Dec-21,3,3,2,,,1,1,no,1,"  Horrible ground service. I ended up paying for a backpack, which he proceeded to weigh, and said that I have too many items in my hand, but it was duty free Bag. As a result he decided to check in my carry on. I am allowed a carry on, and a backpack, and the backpack weighed 5kg and he said that it should weigh 2kg.  I filed a complaint and requested a refund but I was never refunded and always receiving a reply as though my email was never read.  Will never be flying with them again."
Not Verified ,A321 / A350,Business,Economy Class,Barcelona to Munich,May-22,3,4,1,2,,3,3,no,4,"  The section of the terminal for departures to the USA had only one small cart of unrefrigerated sandwiches, and no restaurants or other food carts, only one bad vending machine. The Water2Go water bottle filling station was broken so you had to buy water if you wanted it. How can a section of the airport servicing thousands of international passengers waiting for hours in a secured area have only one small food cart with one employee? Delayed departure from Munich by one hour due to paperwork. Zero food available for purchase in flight. The very little food that was served was not good. The dinner offered in the main cabin was only pasta. No choices at all. In flight entertainment system crashed. Arrived with luggage, but hungry. Preflight customer service was poor. Over an hour to get through on the phone. Spent hours trying to book seats together. Agents were courteous but not helpful.  When we checked in our seats were separated. Gate agents were able to resolve this. Wife unable to upload vaccine card and was told this was normal. Flight from SFO to MAD on Swiss (owned by Lufthansa), missed connection in Zurich because 40 minutes is not enough time for the connection. Passport control took over 40 minutes by itself. Rebooked on a later connection."
✅ Trip Verified ,A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cairo to Munich via Luxembourg ,May-22,1,1,1,1,1,2,1,no,1," I had to fly last minute from CAI to LUX via MUC on Lufthansa. Never again. Despite being a night flight 3h45 long, the staff did not provide any pillows, nor blankets in Economy Class. The 'dinner' was a small cheese croissant with a glass of water or soft drink. No other service. On MUC to LUX (morning flight), no free food at all, only a bottle of water (no other choice). I returned a few days later from LUX to CAI via FRA. The flight from LUX to FRA was 35 min. long only, but the bus transfer from the aircraft to the terminal in FRA was 20 min! Then the FRA-CAI in a new A321 NEO was not parked at a gate, they provided a bus. No service at all on board, only a brown cheese sandwich and a glass of water, no Entertainment of course (flight was night flight, 3h45 long). No move from the staff on call. Very bad experience."
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Brussels to Wroclaw,May-22,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Worst airline ever. Cancelled flight, no assistance, no help from customer service. My flight was rebooked so I will arrive 25 hours behind the schedule. I understand that delays or cancellations happen, however this is the responsibility of an airline to provide hotel, food, taxi. It was all non-existent. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Malta to Stockholm via Frankfurt,May-22,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Embarrassing level of service as usual when I fly with Lufthansa. I’m still trying to go back home from Malta since yesterday morning. 48 hours of delays, cancellations, rebooking and cancellations again. I have spent about 9 hours in the airport by now, today only. Plus 9 hours yesterday. The official reason is bad weather. It’s rather strange that bad weather seems to be affecting only Lufthansa airplanes, while the others fly  on time. Today in Frankfurt there are 20 degrees, no wind at all, no rain, no fog, clear sky. I wonder what bad weather they are talking about. Now in the queue to the Lufthansa service to know what is the plan for today as I missed the second leg of my trip due to almost two hours delay of the flight from Malta. A queue so long that you cannot see the end, but only 2 desperate women at the counter on the brink of quitting their job anytime or start crying."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Bucharest to Chicago via Frankfurt,May-22,3,3,,,,1,1,no,2,  It all started from our flight from Romania to Chicago thru Frankfurt. I was traveling with my grandma who is disabled and can barely move. So the problems started in Romania. The Lufthansa pilots were late for departure for over an hour. When they finally arrived the flight was delayed for another hour due to the weather in Frankfurt. So we were late for over an hour and missed our connection to Chicago. It took us almost two hours to find an open Lufthansa service desk. Three of them were closed. We had to go thru the control to get to the open one So hour and a half later (7pm) the lady at service desk told us that we have to wait till next day 10.45 am to continue our journey and she gave us hotel accommodations off the premises of the airport and there is a shuttle to take us there. 30 minutes to get to the shuttle stop we had to wait for the bus for an hour and a half to find out that the shuttle is not equipped for handicapped people with the chair. Somehow we managed to load my grandma on this shuttle and when we came to hotel they had no ADA equipped rooms or even elevators. We did mange that (I had to carry her again) and went back to our flight in the morning. We were told at the gate that we will be preboarding before everyone else. That didn’t happen cause the person who was suppose to open the elevator for us was nowhere to be found. So we had to wait till everyone boards and then walk through all the people to our seats. So to say I am frustrated would be an understatement. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Paris,May-22,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I had to cancel a ticket for medical reasons and they told me I was going to only get reimbursed for unused taxes.  Considering the current situation and what competitors offer, I find it quite embarrassing that Lufthansa does not provide at least a ticket credit in this situation.  On top of that, I tried talking on the chat with someone and after 2h I finally got connected and the person closed the chat and sent me back to the chatbot even if I hadn't finished typing my message. Truly unprofessional. "
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Tucson via Munich,Feb-22,4,4,3,5,1,1,3,no,3," Zurich to Tucson via Munich. Lufthansa Customer Service is non-existent! One of my return flights got cancelled and a person or an algorithm rebooked my route, and now I arrive in Chicago at 9 PM while my flight to Zurich is at 7 PM. I have been trying to reach them for two weeks now on 800 645 3880, and am on hold forever. They received 9 billion Euros of taxpayers' money and can't afford to employ 20-30 more people in Customer Service Support? And there is the ridiculous robot chat which redirected me to contacting United Airlines, which I did. They were very nice and willing to help but they said only Lufthansa can change the wrongly rebooked flight. So, I have a month left till my flight, hopefully, someone will pick up at some point"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Lisbon via Frankfurt,May-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  This is the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. Late departure, cramped seats, underseat storage was only 3 half-size slots for 4 people (not big enough for a regular size backpack), none of our bags fit, the entertainment system was exceedingly slow and crashed 5 times leading to a blank screen. The flight attendants ignored the call button, I rang it 4 times in 30 minutes and they never peaked out from behind the curtain, I could hear them chatting on the other side, there were numerous other call lights illuminated in the cabin - all went unattended. When I arrived at the transfer airport, they shuttled us all onto our new flight only to wait several hours on the tarmac before telling us that the flight was cancelled. When we were returned to the terminal, the line to speak to customer service was about 500 people long. I waited in line for an hour before an airline employee came and told a large group of us that there was another service desk on the other side of the terminal with no line. He led us all the way across the terminal only to find that the line was easily twice as long. I ended up waiting in the new line for another 2 hours. When I finally got to the front, I was told there was only 1 seat left on any flight on any airline to my destination within 48 hrs, it left 31 hours after my original flight and I had to take it now or leave it. I took it, only to find out on my way to the hotel that I could have rebooked my flight in about 60 seconds via the chat bot on their website and caught a flight within 2 hrs (it had multiple seats available) By the time I discovered this, it was too late to return to the airport and catch the flight, so I had to spend a night in the stopover city, arriving at my destination more than 24 hrs late. The entire experience was a nightmare and I don’t understand how they’re still in business. Speaking of which, the taxi and hotel immediately knew that I was coming from a cancelled Lufthansa flight, it seemed like all of their business came from customers in the same situation. When I returned to the airport the next day, I tried to go to the service desk to change my seat and found a line of a similar length, everyone grumbling about dealing with the same issue."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Bangkok,May-22,4,1,1,1,3,5,3,no,4,"  The aircraft was just lovely, Economy cabin, sat in 28A and my wife sat in 28K both seats offering wonderful legroom which I’d thoroughly recommend @ £85. You really Can’t fault it. However, it takes a good crew to make a decent trip and this one was beyond awful. Busyish overnight flight. The IFE in my wife’s seat was kaput. The mounting bracket was broken, it happens. Crew strangely disinterested. So I swapped seats, armed with my iPad. Once the sear belt sign wax off, I pointed it out to the crew again. No one could be bothered to even look at it. I hadn’t eaten anticipating being fed on board. Service, I was passed a tray, the smell of which had begun to permeate the cabin. No option. Most of which was sparse and totally inedible. The crew after service was conspicuously absent having blacked out the cabin. At lighting up time 1 hr 45 mins from BKK. Another “offering” was handed to me. Mostly inedible, a comically bad sandwich. The sum of all I could stomach was a bread roll and a yoghurt for a ten hour 50 minute trip. I was Ravenous by BKK and destroyed a KFC on arrival. That’s a first in over 40 years of flying. Mean, penny pinching in tough times I can kind of understand, these are tough times. An indifferent, and rank lazy crew however, is just plain unacceptable. Doing the right thing and being nice costs nothing."

✅ Trip Verified ,A340,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Frankfurt,May-22,3,2,2,4,2,3,2,no,3,"  This was my first Lufthansa flight after a gap of 2 years and it was very disappointing. The inflight service was very poor. I found the peanuts/small snack they serve along with the first round of drinks missing. No choice of alcohol, only beer and wine that too only one round. For dinner there was no choice .. only pasta, no choice of veg or non veg. The pasta tasted like nothing. No round of drinks during the 13 hours flight from Singapore to Frankfurt. Just offered one bottle of water after dinner. I remember those occasional rounds of cups with water/juices throughout the night. Before descend they serve breakfast, one muffin and coffee! Before the Pandemic they used to serve omelets/sausages. This is Lufthansa version of cost cutting! Premium airline, we pay premium price and we get poor service."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Vancouver via Frankfurt,May-22,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  First flight got delayed, second one got cancelled with such late notice. I was told an hour after the supposed departure time that the flight would be cancelled. On top of that the stuff are extremely disorganized, rude and unaccommodating. Ive never met less hospitable customer service in my life. When families inquired about a hotel room after their cancelled flights, they were given airplane blankets and told to make do. The staff had no business trying to discipline customers and act authoritative when they were the ones being extremely disorganized about everything. People around me have been stranded for 25 hours. Never taking Lufthansa again."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Istanbul to Frankfurt,May-22,1,5,3,,,2,3,no,5,"  The last, thank goodness of four legs this month with Lufthansa. The crew on all legs were great, punctuality - non-existent. Every flight was delayed. So much for German efficiency. On one leg there had been no food loaded either. Seating on all European carriers' business class are economy seats with the middle seat left empty. Uncomfortable even for short (under three hours) duration. In business, we were offered a meal service and the standard of food was okay. Travellers in economy had to buy theirs when it was available. The staff were excellent on all legs. The last leg, from Frankfurt to Manchester and the predecessor, Istanbul to Frankfurt were all fully booked. Airlines are returning to normal if you discount keeping to schedule."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Business,First Class,Miami to Frankfort,May-22,4,4,3,3,3,1,2,no,6,"  This was not a good experience on Lufthansa specially flying on First Class. The flight was delayed because of weather conditions in Miami, Something that is out of control of the airline. Once we were eventually on board we were greeted by the cabin crew in a professional way. Was approached by the cabin crew chief for the flight, who again expressed her apology's for the delay, and promised to come back with more information once the landing time is in FRA is confirmed, never saw her again. When we arrived in FRA, there was still 15min til my connecting flight, expected someone at the gate to help me get to my flight or at least with some information, no such thing. There was no one at the gate never expected this special traveling in First class. Went to customer service and asked about my connecting flight, and was informed to go to the gate, which was in another building, again being on First class expected at least a golf cart may take me to save time, no such thing, went on my own, off course be the time I reached the gate it was too late. Tried to go to the customer service disk at gates B it was closed, went to the lounge who were of no help and directed me to another service disk, went there and staying in the business and first class line, people in front of me were clearly also from economy also, took me more that an hour to sort my connecting flight, and I had to suggest to them a more suitable connection. Although the first class service on board is very good, however the ground service specially in circumstances like this are very poor."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Hong Kong to Montreal via Frankfurt,Aug-21,5,5,4,4,,5,4,yes,10, We chose Lufthansa to fly from Hong Kong to Montreal with our dog and cat because we'd heard good things about the Frankfurt Animal Lounge. We couldn't be happier with the service we received. Lufthansa helped to turn what could have been an extremely stressful situation into an easy experience. At every stage along the way we were very impressed with the handling and our pets arrived at our destination having clearly been well cared. They were calm and the sanitary material in their enclosures had been changed. I would definitely recommend Lufthansa to anybody travelling with pets.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Johannesburg,May-22,2,3,1,4,,2,3,no,5,"  This was my first Lufthansa Economy long-haul flight (Frankfurt – Johannesburg and v.v.) after quite a while - and it was very disappointing. At first, I found out, that the little bag of peanuts formerly served with the first round of drinks needs to be purchased now. There is a menu in the seat pocket in front of you, where those little things are being advertised as ‘onboard delights’.  For dinner there was the choice of vegetarian pasta, pasta or pasta. It tasted like nothing. Thankfully this airline has foregone the little salt and paper packet, which might have added a little taste at least. With the meal came the second and final round of drinks for this evening. One bottle of water was given to each fellow passenger and the crew was not seen again until next morning. I remember those occasional rounds of cups with water throughout the night but not anymore. There was no choice for breakfast. The airplane, a 747-8, was modern and clean, IFE was working okay and the choice of films were satisfactory, too. Seats typical economy style, I found them ok in terms of legroom, but very narrow for the shoulders. The return flight was a copy of the outbound flight. Lufthansa has by far exaggerated the cost cutting. The ticket was not even cheap, so absolutely no reason for booking Lufthansa again. There are others (four-star airlines) with a much better product than Lufthansa!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Tel Aviv to Frankfurt,May-22,3,4,1,3,1,3,2,no,3," I have flown in the past with Lufthansa and thought they had superior service back in 2010, 2022 - the mask wearing is not necessary at this time any longer. The food was disgusting especially the vegetarian sandwich. The bread is dense and very strong flavored, the spread made me gag. Please remove it from your list of food you serve. The staff were pleasant and kind."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320 NEO,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Palma,May-22,3,5,5,3,,5,5,yes,9," This time, I had a fine flight, a little bit better than my expectations. Really positive was the spotlessly clean and modern aircraft, the new food presentation, the professional staff and a great lounge experience in Frankfurt. Every advertised point was delivered, it was a quite good value for money. As the seats were quite uncomfortable (spartanic Economy seats in Business Class with a surprisingly good legroom) and as there was no wifi on board, it was a solid 4 Star experience on this 100 minutes flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Basel to Munich,May-22,4,5,5,,,4,5,yes,10,"  Our flights were changed as we slept the night before we were to fly home. From the time we were to arrive in Munich until we were to board our flight to the USA, there were only 35 minutes, and I was supposed to be assisted by an attendant with a wheelchair. By the time we actually arrived, there were only 25 minutes left and we were listed as on Standby. Needless to say panic swept in. The stewardesses were so kind and caring! They kept reassuring me that we would make it in time. They had the pilot contact the next flight to let them know we were coming. They need a medal for their service!  My husband and I would not have made it without the kindness and care of these ladies."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Marseille to Quebec via Paris,Jun-21,3,3,,,,1,1,no,1,"  This experience takes place before the 2020 covid crisis. I had bought round trip tickets from Marseille to Quebec for a price of about 700€ in November 2019. The outward journey in January 2020 and the return in April 2020 (Quebec-Montreal-Zurich-Marseille). During the Covid crisis, all flights, including all companies, were cancelled. For Lufthansa also, the company modified the flights, telling me that some of the internal flights were to be modified, around March. It took hours with customer services to find and agree on another internal flight, only for the trip to be cancelled two days later. This has happened several times. The company is now cancelling all these flights in April, which is understandable in view of the global crisis. The postponement of flights is done on the month of May, where the customer service simply tell me that my flight has been moved as is to the following month. A few weeks before departure, internal flights were also cancelled, forcing me to spend hours on the phone to get a new flight and keep my trip. Once done, the flight was cancelled again, telling me that the company had no flights in April and postponed my trip to May. It's also the same story when my May flight date arrives, hours on the phone to change an internal flight after it was cancelled only to be told that my flight has to be rescheduled for June. Except that I consulted the company's website to check if a new reservation was possible. Indeed, the company was operating flights but the tickets were close to 5000$. The company's strategy was simple, postpone my flight booked in November 2019 for 700€ to avoid losing a seat which was then sold at five times. I had to buy another ticket (from another company) to be able to return. Obviously the actions to be reimbursed for my return have never given any answers."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320 Neo,Business,Business Class,London to Rhodes via Munich,May-22,3,2,1,,,2,4,yes,3,"  I've flown Lufthansa many times before, mainly because of its competitive pricing (if booked early), and don't mind connecting flights. But one of its biggest disappointments on the service front is its lack of consistency. On some short-haul flights, the service has been excellent, being addressed by name and frequently checked on if I needed anything, and good food, and on others the service was almost nonexistent. On boarding my flight at Heathrow, and from Munich to London, there was no priority boarding, but the first ten rows ushered in first. There was no welcome, and Anti-bacterial wipes were handed out, but not on the return flights. On the London to Munich sector, breakfast on board was quite substantial, with ham and cheese, cereal, but with cold bread and croissant. On the flights to Rhodes and return to London, the food was unappetizing. One expects a hot meal for lunch and not a concoction of something cold. On the flight from Rhodes to Munich, there were only two passengers in the business cabin. However, the lunch was swiftly served, cleared within about 15 minutes, and the crew not seen until landing. Overall, although there was no interaction with passengers, the cabin crew was efficient and polite. On the drinks front, seconds were not offered, and I had to ask for them. As for seating, it is as most European airlines are, with no extra legroom, except for the middle seat left empty. I was disappointed with the downgrading of Lufthansa's overall in-flight service, and only give my thumbs up for good value when it comes to the ticket price."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seoul to Frankfurt,May-22,3,5,1,,,4,4,yes,5,"  These flights were dreadful. The return leg of my journey was 13hrs, we were fed 1hr into the flight and then once again 1hr before landing, only one meal was hot. After waiting 11hrs to be fed again they served a nasty sandwich . There was no snack provided, despite the FAs telling us we would be given a snack mid-way through the flight. The only hot meals provided across all flights was the same vegetarian pasta. I’m a bit hung up on the food, but these are extremely long flights and I’ve flown this route several times with several other airlines and have always had good experiences with the meals considering it’s such a long journey. The best part of my journeys were the staff, however. Cannot fault them. Someone had taken ill on the flight and they really went out of their way to ensure the passenger was okay, always providing drinks and checking up. They were kind and professional, definitely one of my favourite FA teams. My short flights were fine, up and down quickly so not much to say. My fare was also amazingly cheap considering the route so I guess I did get exactly what I paid for. I’d fly them again, but not long haul."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to London,Oct-21,4,4,,,,1,2,no,1,  Had to pay twice for baggage because their system didn't recognise I'd paid prior to arrival. This error didn't show up until I got to the boarding gate. Was promised a refund if I contacted customer services. 6 months later I get an email saying its company policy not to refund baggage charges and now its too late for my bank to do a charge back. Avoid at all costs.
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Frankfurt,Apr-22,5,5,3,5,,1,2,no,3,"  I can't find the words to express our frustration with the inability to talk to someone. Luggage lost on April 28th (and reported that day). No telephone calls until May 4th. We called baggage claim three times and were put on hold immediately. Two separate times we waited 2 hours, currently on a 30-minute hold, and were hung up on. Three times we called Customer Care and after a brief conversation were put on hold and immediately disconnected. Five calls to the Call Center one evening, put on hold electronically, and hung up  on after 5 minutes. Finally, we tried to obtain our luggage on a return flight and the baggage office at the airport was backed up such that we could not get our bag before our plane took off. "

Layover time was 45min. At Milano airport, captain and crew came about an hour late, cause their driver pick them up late.  Do not make your customers to pay your mistake! Because of this ridiculous reason, we missed our connect flight. We have to go to Stuttgart, then fly to Dubrovnik. Lost half of day and paid double for taxi ride (it was too late to cancel the taxi arrangement). And today, May 5th 2022. Flight From Dubrovnik to Frankfurt, delay again.  And miss the connect flight to Milano.  Now we have to spend a night at Holiday Inn airport without luggage. This is the worst flight experience ever."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Cancun via Frankfurt,May-22,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Worst experience and customer service! I purchased tickets for my brother and his wife from Istanbul to Cancun, they were supposed to fly through Frankfurt in transit. We checked information before and they didn't need a visa to Germany since it is a transit flight. Lufthansa at the gate stopped them and said they were denied entry and didn't provide any reason.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747,Business,Economy Class,Sao Paulo to Frankfurt,May-22,5,1,1,5,,1,1,no,1,"  I have never been treated in such disrespectful way as I was by Lufthansa staff. I have to admit that I arrived at the check in 1 hour after the recommended time, nevertheless I had time to perform the check in and drop of my language.  I got my ticket but as I was quite late I did not pay attention to the information issued in the ticket, for my surprise I found out at the departure gate that the ticket was issued under another passenger’s name which was already onboard and so the stickers of my languages which were already dropped off. I run back to the check in, there was no one there, the flight was going to leave in 45 minutes and I was desperate. After 15 minutes trying to reach someone from Lufthansa we were able to reach someone and the same lady came to fix her mistake.  After 30 minutes (flight was already in delay), she was able to issue a new ticket for me, now on my name. I run like a was in a marathon to the gate and I was able to make it. When I thought I had been thought enough for my surprise when found my seat a gentlemen approach me saying that I was in the wrong seat, that one belongs to his wife that was not able to embark due to immigration issues, but he has paid for them and he would like to use it during the trip to lay down. He was super polite and I understood his point, I would wanted the same if I was on his shoes. I approached one of the crew to ask her to find another seat for me and she said ""there is no other place, flight is full and he does not own any seat, you can stay where you are”.  Dinner was absolutely horrible, tasteless pasta with pure sugar milk rice a bread and salad. There was not even option to choose from."

Food horrible - pasta with red sauce, old frozen salad - with frozen dressing - old bread, butter frozen. You treat people worse than animals! I will never fly with you again!

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Heathrow to Melbourne via Singapore,Apr-22,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," Heathrow to Melbourne via Singapore. My original flight to Melbourne was cancelled by Lufthansa, they put me on an alternative flight that meant 16 hours layover in Singapore, phoned them to find a more suitable option. They put me on another flight which apparently they did ""by mistake"" - 4 days before flying that flight disappeared off the booking - when phoned them, (4 times, every time they put me on hold for hours and hung up) on the 4th time they said they can't find a flight to put me on as the fares are different so they can only take me up to Singapore and I'll have to find my own flight to Melbourne (the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard by a major airline and I'm a frequent traveller). After wasting hours and hours I've gone nowhere with them - 4 days before my flight instead of packing, I'm trying to find flights to Melbourne. Extremely stressed out. Customer service is absolutely horrendous one of them threatened to disconnect the call because I was 'upset' and then disconnected my call too. Avoid at all costs!"
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Abuja to Toronto via Frankfurt,Apr-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Abuja to Toronto via Frankfurt. I got a return ticket from Abuja to Toronto but was supposed to transit in Frankfurt and Munich. I never knew you’re only allowed to transit one Schengen state, I’d be transiting more than one you’d be needing a transit visa, the ticket I bought never mentioned this, so I was made to pay $1900 to reroute my flight so that I’ll be able to transit in just Frankfurt. Worst experience ever, just another way of ripping customers off their hard-earned money."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Luxembourg to Manchester via Frankfurt,Apr-22,3,3,,,,2,3,yes,8,"  Our short flight from Luxembourg to Frankfurt was delayed by over 90 minutes - we were certain we were going to miss our connecting flight. However we made it just by sprinting through Frankfurt airport to our flight to Manchester. We could not get hold of customer service in Frankfurt or on the phone. Flights overall were uneventful however the return from Manchester we repeatedly tried to check in online, but the system would not let us - in the end we went to the airport three hours before take-off. Good service on the way back and no problems with the connections. But Manchester airport was suffering from a lack of staff at security."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tel Aviv to Dallas via Frankfurt,Apr-22,2,4,,,,1,1,no,1," The absolute worst. Delays causing missed connections. My baggage did not arrive at my final destination. No customer service, nobody to speak with, sent on a wild goose chase of filling out feedback forms and sending emails but receiving no reply. I still do not even know the fate of my suitcase (after 5 days) as it is impossible to contact any human being for info and, as I have said, no replies to my messages. I will walk or swim before I use Lufthansa again and I'll plan to make sure that all my family, friends and colleagues choose other options as well. Avoid, avoid, avoid - do not fly Lufthansa! (the horrific Frankfurt Airport is also in the top worst international airports, but will post about my negative experience there in the appropriate place)."

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Amsterdam via Munich,Apr-22,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,no,2,"  After you book your ticket its almost impossible to get Customer service. We called directly to a number in Germany a few times and got somebody a couple of times. On our outbound flight, they rebooked us on United because our original flights had some delays. But when we arrived at the airport, United has no record of our reservation and try as they might they can't reach Lufthansa either at 4pm in the afternoon. We got a flight later in the evening causing a Munich stopover instead of the original Frankfurt and then to Amsterdam. The experience was bad.  On our return from Amsterdam, it was a code share with Swiss Air through Zurich. That flight was overbooked and they told us we won't have seats. Swiss Air were equally unhelpful. We finally got onto KLM hours later, however there was no Lufthansa person to be found at the Airport or by Phone to help with this. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Glasgow,Apr-22,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Booked an economy light fare which only included a very small 8kg carry on bag. I found it strange that a full service airline would even have that option but given the fare was not cheap I assumed service on board would make up for this. Boarding was slow and messy requiring passengers to queue to have their documents checked, then queue again to check our tickets, then queue again in the jet bridge. What is the point of assigning boarding groups when all but priority passengers are called to board at the same time? Seats in economy were akin to a budget airline with minimal legroom, no headrest or entertainment. Cabin was not clean, and crew handed out alcohol wipes. On both legs I took with Lufthansa there was no food or drink available, complimentary or paid. This was a 2 hour service right about lunchtime. Almost any other full service airline would have provided some sort of food service. It is already low cost carrier like to only have paid food services. To have no service at all is just pathetic for a 5 Star Airline. Crew were barely seen during the flight. To top it off the flight was delayed. Overall the flight was worse than ultra low cost carriers while charging more. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Economy Class,Heathrow to Frankfurt,Apr-22,3,3,1,,,3,3,no,1,  The carry on limit of 8kg is insane when your baggage size meet carry on standard dimensions. I flew million miles with this bag without any issue but getting your bag registered at the gate because it’s exceed 8kg while small overhaul size is not convenient. No drink on board except water because of COVID measure that can be understandable in present context…
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Lyon to Frankfurt,Apr-22,2,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  I bought a flight with Lufthansa choosing a seat at the front due to my left ankle being fractured, so I needed the additional time to make it between gates. The day of they bump me from 4C to 29C, no one at the Lufthansa counter even 40 minutes before scheduled boarding so I call their helpline. The person eventually sees what they did, and says they'll reinstate my seat. They said they were sending the email right then. I get off the call and surprise surprise no email and when I check online my seat assignment is still at the back of the plane. Eventually ten minutes before boarding two crew members are at the desk, I ask about the situation, they tell me there is one seat available but that ""it's impossible to move you"" even though the seat is 5D. Same class same price. How could this have been worse you might ask? The flight ended up being delayed outbound too so the short time I had got cut in half. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Amman,Jan-22,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Frankfurt to Amman. The phone service is very bad, you can not get anyone answering the phone to adjust your ticket nor to add your pet to the ticket. The seats are not that comfortable compared to other airlines and the most important thing is that you do not get any food, drinks or beverages on Lufthansa flights which is unacceptable hence you pay a good amount of money for no service where other cheaper airlines are providing beverage services and even other services like entertainment tv, etc!"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Johannesburg,Apr-22,1,1,1,2,1,4,2,no,5," My wife and I recently travelled on LH 572 and 573 between Johannesburg and Frankfurt. Over the years I have traveled numerous times on Lufthansa and I’m sad to say that this time around, Lufthansa did not live up to its reputation of being Europe’s 5 star airline. The meal choice was poor (only veggie pasta on both legs) and the service of the crew left much to be desired. It seems like the lack of customer service just gets blamed on Covid. Worst of all was the terrible spacing/leg room in economy class. It is big enough for a 10 year old kid but not for a normal size adult. It really felt like the airline wanted to cramp in more passengers to make up for the losses incurred during the pandemic without any regard to the comfort of passengers. On the second leg of our journey we even wanted to upgrade to premium economy or business class but turns out since the FRA-JHB route is so busy, both flights were fully booked. As a Miles and More member I was deeply disappointed. I usually don’t complain about airlines and I’m not pleased I even had to write this one. However, comparing the passenger comfort and the customer service of Lufthansa to that of the middle eastern airlines, or even other European airlines, it really makes me question whether I should fly Lufthansa ever again. Again, I regret having to write this note to you but I sincerely hope things will improve in the near future."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Frankfurt,Mar-22,1,1,1,1,1,3,2,no,1,"  The worst flight I have taken in my 50 years of travel. The Crew were abrasive and disengaging, clearly service was not a priority. If you asked a question you received a surly blunt response. The aircraft was  extremely uncomfortable and offered old in-flight entertainment. The headsets we received needed to be manipulated to accommodate this older system. The food provided was pathetic - macaroni and cheese for Economy class.  It turned out to be overcooked white pasta with processed Parmesan cheese thrown in for good measure. The salad was at least real. The breakfast was a sugar cake muffin with three small pieces of pineapple chunks. When I asked if I had received the meal as perhaps this was for children, I was told no that was the economy class meal. I will not fly Lufthansa again and have gone out of my way to tell many of my colleagues family and friends about this horrendous experience."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cape Town to London via Frankfurt,Apr-22,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  Worst travel experience of my entire life. Flight delayed from London meant 80 people missed the connection from Germany to Cape Town. Instead of holding the flight 30 minutes, Lufthansa let 80 people miss it. I was stranded in Germany for the night and then sent to Istanbul and then to Cape Town. What should have been a 12 hour trip took 48 hours and I was one of the lucky people, others on my flight with young families were having less luck and sent on even longer journeys with layovers of 12+ house. My flight back has now also been delayed by 14 hours. "

I was able though to change my seat after downloading the LH mobile app. The vaccination cert was requested / checked by 3 different staff at bag dropoff and boarding. Horrible food served  with overcooked vegetarian pasta served for mains on both outbound and inbound flights. IFE was mediocre with a very poor selection of films. The staff were brusque. Seat comfort poor. Used LH pre pandemic and the experience was much better.
Not Verified ,A340-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Frankfurt,Apr-22,1,1,3,2,,2,3,no,5,"  I would like to call this my worst flying experience. In-flight staff were rude and could not care less about the needs of the passengers. I had to ask for a cup of water thrice before I could get one. Seats were very congested and leg-room was just ok. On a long-haul flight of about 13.5 hours from Singapore to Frankfurt, only one proper meal was served with no option of any kind of dish having meat in it. A bland vegetable penne pasta with a 1.5 x 1.5-inch sized piece of brownie and that is pretty much it. They did not serve any kind of mid-meal snacks as they did not have any in the first place and the air-hostess stated this upfront that ""we do not serve any kind of snacks on this flight"". I am for sure not going to fly with Lufthansa ever again in my life in normal situations."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Brussels via Frankfurt,Mar-22,3,4,1,1,1,4,1,no,1,"  A very mediocre experience. For a 13 hours flight, they provided passengers with a hot meal and a snack. The plane was dirty, my entertainment system worked once in a while. They charged us an additional 70 EUR for the seats but changed them offline. Their service in Mexico city is a joke and never answers calls."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Tbilisi to Paris via Munich,Apr-22,4,5,5,,,4,5,yes,8,"  Lufthansa flight from Tbilisi to Munich in business class. The onboard service was good and the staff was professionally engaging with passengers. Food was great and the cabin was clean. The only problem was that Lufthansa does not have an agreement with a business lounge in Tbilisi airport. Therefore, all business passengers were rejected to enter into the lounge. This is very sad. Hope this issue will be solved as soon as possible."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tbilisi to Heathrow via Munich,Mar-22,1,2,2,,,1,3,no,1,"  Our flight had to make an emergency landing due to an unwell passenger which was understandable however what happened next made me never want to fly with Lufthansa again. Pilot said we could either rebook onto another flight or stay in a hotel while another flight is arranged for us. Upon departing the plane we were approached by a member of staff of Ankara airport who had no ties to Lufthansa. She provided a phone number to get in contact with Lufthansa should we want to rearrange a flight, this number did not work. After calling multiple Lufthansa numbers we were told different lies on every attempt as to why they couldn't rebook us onto a flight leaving in 2 hours. The best one was that our baggage hadn't been released by the airport when we in fact had the baggage in our hands. On 2 occasions the member of staff  we were speaking to just stopped replying to any questions or queries and seemed to have hung up. This all resulted in a substantial phone bill and a missed days work. After contacting them to offer the opportunity to reimburse the said phone bill as a good will gesture and reinvest some faith in this airline I was accused of demanding compensation. "

Was told pilot didn't want to fly because of weather conditions (low clouds) but other aircraft departing no problem. Checked Flightaware.com which showed no arrival delays in MUC. No other information given. Was told I would not make the MUC to BOS flight so they canceled my whole itinerary and re-booked my travel to the next day. Was given hotel and meal voucher. Next day, departed KRK 20 minutes late and arrived MUC 20 minutes late. Only had an hour to transfer between terminal 2 and remote terminal in MUC. Ridiculous security screening just to get to the departure gate. My bags were searched 3 times at 3 check points. Woman in front of me made the flight. I got there 5 minutes later and they had closed the doors and refused to allow me on. I am sitting here in MUC as I write this looking at my plane still sitting at the departure gate nearly an hour after the scheduled departure time and I am furious. No excuse to strand me in MUC especially since the plane is departing late anyways."

Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Dallas,Mar-22,3,1,3,3,2,1,3,no,1," Frankfurt to Dallas. Plane had to be diverted to Iceland due to Smoke Sensors going off. As a passenger, we were given ZERO information from Lufthansa and no help on anything. There were so many problems from not providing food vouchers or drink vouchers and we were in Iceland for 12 hours to no help on booking a return replacement flight to incredibly rude, condescending and unhelpful Lufthansa Customer Service people that walked away from you if they didn't like your question to only having one person working the service counter with 300 people standing in lines. We understand planes are moving parts that do fail, but the lack of communication and NO communication from Lufthansa is inexcusable as well as not adhering to the EU passenger rights. After having been in airplanes for over 50 hours trying to get home and Lufthansa was no help. Then Lufthansa lost my bag and when received they had rifled through my belongings and didn't put things back. The rudeness of the Stewardess was like nothing I had ever experienced - they were arrogant, condescending and borderline vile."

The result was to lose my flight, book another flight on my cost, force me to do COVID rapid test at the airport facility and stay for 5 hours more in the airport till the next flight! This is unbelievable! Incapable and inadequate personnel of Lufthansa. I will never travel again with this operator! Extremely bad client service and misguidance."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Munich,Dec-21,,,,,,,1,no,2,"  Horrible Customer Service. The country i was flying to had closed its borders because of rising covid cases, and no tourist would be allowed to enter. Naturally, I had to cancel my flight and ask for a refund. When i called them when I saw that I was not refunded a few months later, they started by saying that it is my fault and people should stop trying to blame them for the cancelled flights since they chose the lower tier ticket. Even when I explained to her, that I was not even allowed to enter the country even if i wanted to take the flight, she kept saying it is my fault for doing that and not reading the fine prints. Needless to say, i always prefer to pay extra and know that my ticket is refundable, but in this case the non-refundable fine print was really fine I guess. Horrible customer service, and always ready to point fingers even during a pandemic. I would never fly with them ever again. Horrible experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,First Class,Frankfurt to Mexico,Mar-22,3,4,4,2,5,4,3,yes,6,"  Lufthansa first class is in need of a facelift. Service and food are good (even though the flight attendant forgot my appetisers), the amenities are fine. The space is well, spacious, but the seat is old and there is no privacy. The entertainment system is archaic. Screen too small and far, movie selection not up to-date and system not user friendly. On a 12+ hour flight it is important to have a good entertainment system, privacy in first class and a welcoming bed. Lufthansa first class is in dire need of refurbishment. (Same applies to its first class terminal in Frankfurt)"

Lufthansa in comparison with Air France act like not professionals at all. Lufthansa check-in staff that is in charge of check-in procedure for the flight to Russia do not know the rules and regulations regarding the entering Russia. One shift staff deny you to board, but in the same situation the other shift staff let you board. Lufthansa staff deny passengers to board and do not rebook a ticket for the next 3-days-flight, because the flights are overloaded.  Change a schedule of the flight without specifying the reason in the information letter."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Seattle to Funchal via Frankfurt, Munich, Porto",Feb-22,3,4,3,2,1,1,1,no,1,"  Our entire group said this was the worst experience traveling we have ever had. We understood the weather issues, they happen. Everything else wasted our time excessively. Here is the breakdown of what happened. Seattle to Frankfurt (Great), Frankfurt to Madeira - Circle above Madeira try to land get directed back to Lisbon - Go to Lisbon then back to Frankfurt Where it all goes downhill. Stay night in Frankfurt- can't give us details on if they can book us but to show up at 7 the next morning. Two groups split half go to Porto other half Frankfurt to Munich then to Porto - Wait in airport till 8PM, flight cancelled. -Wait in a line for a few hours just to be taken to a hotel and to come back the next day - Booked for Thursday morning but messed up an individuals to the point that he can't do anything on the app. We are told to come back at 8 PM on Thursday for the flight After chatting with them we find out the bikes made it to Porto except 1.  Get call at 3:55 AM saying we missed our flight, they changed without notice so two of our members go to the airport. We chat that morning and are about to go to the airport to figure it out when the front desk lady of the hotel says that we need to be out by 1 as taxis are coming.  Go to airport for flight find out they didn’t transfer our bike reservation to it and they can’t fit them now. Individual chats with them for 4 hours. Gets us finally on a larger flight that will take our bags. Charged $60 extra dollars per bike We spent 7 days in airports and airplanes out of 11. In the first 5 days we had 12 hours not in an airport or plane because of everything. We tried to make the best of the weather delays and enjoy the city we got stuck in. But with your changes without telling us and your complete lack of care for your customers we didn't get any days. We lost all of our time to this. Weather is fine, what you guys pulled is not you need to fix this. "
Not Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Delhi to Chicago via Frankfurt,Jan-22,3,4,4,5,,3,5,yes,8,  The inflight experience in Lufthansa was quite comfortable on both legs. The service was very good with a good choice of food and drinks available on the flights with generous portions. The IFE screen was superb and there was a good selection of movies. The seats were large and with good leg room but somehow found that the lower back support was not very good. However the on-ground experience was not as good as the premium economy experience with other airlines especially on the Delhi to Frankfurt leg of the flight. Lufthansa does not have a separate check-in counter for Premium Economy and did not offer priority boarding as well on the Delhi Frankfurt leg but did so on the Frankfurt - Chicago leg which was a bit strange. Frankfurt was a very comfortable airport for transiting with a lot of comfortable seating across the airport and good food options.
✅ Trip Verified ,Bombardier CRJ900,Business,Business Class,Brussels to Frankfurt,Jan-22,2,2,2,,,1,2,no,4,  Boarding at Brussels was smooth and on time. Food served was a kind of cheese cake that tasted OK but was rather poorly presented. Anyway it was better than the uninspired  sandwich Lufthansa served in business class on previous flights I took with them recently. Seats in business class are the same as in economy with the seat next to you kept free which is a plus giving the feeling of being a bit more Covid safe. Disembarking in Frankfurt was at an apron position and all passengers were packed together in a bus that drove us to the terminal. This really didn’t feel Covid safe and I really disliked this. If they have to bus passengers to the terminal can’t they just not divide the transfer in 2 busses so people don’t have to stand shoulder to shoulder during the drive?
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Dubai,Feb-22,3,4,3,3,2,1,1,no,1,"  Disgusting service, they wouldn't let me on the plane without paper PCR even though it says electronic is fine online!

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Miami,Feb-22,,,,,,2,2,no,2,"  The communication and responsibility for customer is the worst I have ever seen. We had connected flight Vilnius - Frankfurt - Miami. The first flight was late for 1 hour. In Frankfurt airport weren't enough workers and we spent in an enormous queue. Even we asked a few workers to let us to go to the plane - nobody cared.  Communication and attitude, responsibility are something the company doesn't understand.  Lufthansa didn't take responsibility for its mistake."
Not Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Berlin to Dubai via Munich,Jan-22,4,4,1,2,,1,3,no,3,"  The decline of Lufthansa in the last 10 years is among the worst in the industry, service reductions and cost cuttings wherever you look. It started with check in, which in Berlin is done by a contract company that is not able to provide its agents with accurate information on entry requirements. I had a long argument with the agent who nearly refused to issue my boarding passes although I had all the necessary documents with me (and no problem at all at immigration in Dubai later). Flight from Berlin to Munich on time, but otherwise nothing to praise about it. Lufthansa has introduced a buy on board service on domestic and European flights, but they didn't offer anything on this flight, so even if I had wanted, I couldn't get a coffee or snack. Munich airport is very easy to transfer, but repeated document checks at the gate resulted in a delayed departure. First time flying in Lufthansa's premium economy, and while I liked the seat comfort and additional space, it's disappointing that the service has been reduced to exactly the same as in regular economy, apart from a tiny glass of juice after boarding. They also cut the nuts or crackers with the first drink round, and they now serve coffee or tea together with the meal. That doesn't make any sense as your coffee will be cold once you have finished the meal. On the other hands, portions are shrinking year by year, so there is quite a chance that the coffee is still warm. Lufthansa definitely has to improve its service in economy, otherwise I will avoid them in the future."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cape Town to Bristol via Frankfurt,Feb-22,3,3,1,5,,1,2,no,2,"  I have flown with Lufthansa many times in the past (pre covid). I recently flew return Bristol to Cape via Frankfurt, choose seats on online check in, got to check in desk they had been changed on both legs of our journey. Don't really know where to start with the food from Frankfurt - Cape Town, dry cold pasta with the tiniest bit of sauce, hard roll, breakfast- a green wrap with cheese and pesto? Same on return leg apart from wrap swapped for hard cheese roll. A lot of people complaining. Check in at Cape town, absolute chaos, 1hr 45, told to fill in 'Traveller Health Questionnaire' at last minute, very stressful, a lot of confused check in staff. Don't think I will be flying Lufthansa until I hear they have improved."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Johannesburg via Frankfurt,Jan-22,4,4,3,2,,5,5,yes,8,"  Want to thank Becky at Lufthansa Manchester at check-in, when I needed to have a printed copy of my PCR result for final destination (Zimbabwe), Let me send the email from my phone to Lufthansa where she later printed it and it was waiting for me at the boarding gate. That's going the extra mile. Well done."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Reykjavík,Jan-22,2,5,5,,,1,2,yes,3," Lufthansa's European Business Class product is similar to most other carriers - the seats are the same as Economy except for the empty middle one. This affords a little more space and privacy. The other point of difference is the food served. The boarding at FRA was chaotic. Several Economy Class passengers slipped into the Priority lane and there was nobody to monitor this transgression. The whole purpose of paying Business Class is to have a premium experience. Lufthansa failed utterly in providing the basic of this product. Most of the Lufthansa A320neo aircraft have no WiFi. And there is no other form of entertainment. Truly, Lufthansa seems to be aiming at recreating the Stone Age era of aviation. The only saving grace of Lufthansa these days is the outstanding onboard service."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Mumbai to Frankfurt,Jan-22,2,5,5,3,1,3,2,yes,5,"  Mumbai to Frankfurt was served by 20+ years old A340-300. The Business Class seats have seen better days, are narrow, lumpy, and not exactly premium. The Business Class lavatories were indistinguishable from Economy Class. The bright spot in the Lufthansa long haul Business Class offering these days is the exceptional onboard service. On this particular flight  the inflight WiFi was not working (I paid for it and requested a refund)."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Seoul to Stockholm via Munich,Jan-22,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  The staff at the Seoul check-in were extremely unfriendly and uninterested in any form of customer service. The food was the driest, most tasteless meal I have had onboard. Then the Munich airport business lounge was not even worth one star. Lack of choices in food and not properly chilled drinks. On top of that, you can expect the reception staff to be very blunt. The lady who cleans the shower booth yelled at me for not having waited standby near the shower booth when the shower was ready.  When she found a translator I asked for an apology for her attitude but I did not get one. I reached out to Lufthansa customer service to file complaint but did not hear back back."

Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Malta via Frankfurt ,Dec-21,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," I have flown with Lufthansa on 26.12.2021 from Copenhagen to Vienna, and unfortunately lost my connecting flight from Vienna to Malta. So on 27.12.2021, I flew from Vienna to Frankfurt, and then Frankfurt to Malta where Lufthansa has lost my baggage. The lack of communication from Lufthansa and the lack of service that has followed ever since is beyond belief. I received a message as soon as I landed in Malta on 27.01.2021 that my suitcase had not been loaded on the flight. I checked with Lufthansa at the airport right away and filled the correct report – I was instructed to do nothing more and to call Malta Airport and check the next day and arrange for delivery. The luggage has still not arrived and it is 2 weeks later 09.01.2022. From what I was told by the Lufthansa desk in Malta they tried to communicate and investigate with Vienna with no response. From what I can see on the Lufthansa tracking on their site the baggage was sent on 28.12.2021 from Vienna to Malta, and then for some unknown reason from Malta to Frankfurt - however, Malta Airport is reporting the luggage never even landed in Malta. Since then I have had to contact Lufthansa who claims there is no report even made, I have called Frankfurt Airport, Vienna Airport, and Copenhagen Airport to try and get some assistance, I have been passed around and have to communicate with Central Baggage Services and World Tracker – this is beyond infuriating and also just simply unfair as Lufthansa should be able to at the very least guide me in what to do and see where the error happened.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Frankfurt,Jan-22,1,1,1,1,,2,1,no,1,"  They cancel flights at will. They do not respond to emails! Spent 3 days holding on to various calls. Complete waste of time.  Most airlines are very accommodating on this route. Given, it is a twelve hour flight. Lufthansa Beverages appalling. The seat had insufficient padding and back/neck support for a long-haul flight.  The staff were surly and rude. Kept bumping into us passengers, The plane was however new and clean; and in good order. I will never fly Lufthansa again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Premium Economy,Detroit to Brussels via Frankfurt,Jan-22,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Their customer service is unreachable. They make it impossible to make changes online, and impossible to get ahold of a customer service rep. I was on hold for over three hours to try to change my flight. The representative told me she could not assist me with reservation because I booked them online but that I must go through her to rebook seats I had already paid for. I was instructed to cancel my flights and rebook them and call customer service back with the new reservation codes to get my seats reassigned without repaying for seat assignments. I did that and called back. Again, I was on hold for hours. I gave the new customer service rep my old and new reservation numbers and she was able to transfer my seat assignments but then I realized I did not get any money back for my canceled flights. Even though they say you can exchange the tickets. You can’t if you cancel. And that’s what they told me to do. After fighting they gave me my money back. When we finally flew it was packed so tight, delayed 45 minutes and lost our bags. I will never fly this airline again. They were impossible to get any help or direction. Their customer service was literally the worst."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Malaga,Dec-21,1,4,1,,,2,1,no,2,"  The quality of food is poor, we got a cold meal (German sausage salad) on our 2.5 hr flight.

✅ Trip Verified ,A340-300,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Singapore,Dec-21,2,2,3,3,,5,2,no,4,"  One of the few airlines still flying the Airbus A340, which many have retired. Lufthansa has made decent effort to update the cabin of the A340, so good work on that. What's bad is the attitude of it's cabin crew. There was a steward whom whenever someone else is in his way, he will just push his way through. There was another stewardess who was going round checking everyone's belted up, and noticed a father was struggling to belt up the toddler. She stood beside him on the aisle, hands on her hips and just waited silently. Those were the black sheep, because there were nice cabin crew too, such as another steward who thanked me for pulling up the shades as we were about to land. The food served is good, but you didn't have a choice of selection in economy. I understand it is part of being sustainable so you prevent food wastage, and choices are a luxury, but when my ticket costs as much as Singapore Airlines, I felt I overpaid for an inferior experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Warsaw,Dec-21,4,5,3,,,5,3,yes,7,"  LH1376 from Frankfurt to Warsaw. Boarding went smoothly and the cabin was spotlessly clean. On this 90-minute flight, a small lunch (a wurstsalat from Lufthansa's Tasting HEIMAT business meals) was served. The portion size was a bit small for a midday flight, but you could add as many warm rolls as you wanted. The crew seemed exceptionally joyful and light-hearted. All in all very enjoyable flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Zurich to Frankfurt,Dec-21,4,5,4,,,5,3,yes,8,"  LH1185 from ZRH to FRA. This was a very smooth morning flight with an excellent crew. The flight was about half full (also in business) and boarding was fast. Even though it was a short flight of approximately 40 minutes, a small snack of muesli with fresh fruit was served, which was very tasty. The aircraft was spotlessly clean. All in all an excellent experience for such a short flight."

For some reason unknown to myself, despite flying about a hundred flights a year for years, I stupidly forgot my passport for this trip to Seoul. I managed to retrieve with Uber from home but it meant I was still at checkin just 20 mins before departure. The SAS/Lufthansa checkin staff did an amazing job and showed incredible flexibility to somehow get me onboard. Thanks a million for fantastic service which won’t be forgotten!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Luxembourg to Sofia via Munich,Dec-21,,,,,,,1,no,1,  Unfortunately my 75 year old father forgot his ID card in Belgium so was unable to take the flight from Luxembourg yesterday. It's been non-stop stress since then trying to get him to Bulgaria with no help from Lufthansa. Thankfully we will get him here in time for Christmas through a different airline but have been told that Lufthansa considers him a no show for this trip and have now canceled his return ticket. They are willing to sell this same ticket back to us for an additional 327 euros however. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cancun to Frankfurt,Dec-21,4,4,,,,1,1,no,1,"  We booked a return flight to Namibia for December back in October when Namibia was considered one of the safest places to travel regarding Covid. Unfortunately this all changed end of November. We flagged this with Lufthansa (after spending 1.5 hours waiting for customer service) but they were unwilling to help us and said it is the ‘risk of this time. Their suggestion was that we ignore restrictions and use the ticket to fly to Namibia. I will never again choose Lufthansa. In the end our only option was rebooking to another destination and paying a hefty premium on an already expensive ticket (+50% extra charge), and travelling to Cancun with Eurowings."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Tampa,Dec-21,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I needed to rebook my flight because of a notification in a change in flight times, so I asked for a refund to get this done. My $580 ticket was refunded $80. I was convinced this was an error, so I spent the next month getting transferred to different customer service departments. Ultimately, here’s the reply I received: “ We would like to inform you that As per our investigation Voluntary Full refund as per Fare rules correctly processed on ticket as there was no Flight cancellation found. We realize that this may not be the response you wished but we hope that this experience will not prevent you from making your future travel plans with Lufthansa.” I will never fly with Lufthansa."

His behavior was extremely professional and kind in a hectic environment and he multi-tasked consistently and cheerfully. He went above and beyond to help make our flight comfortable and make sure that we had everything squared away. If he is an example of the kind of people that Lufthansa hires, than it is no wonder that they are a 5 star airline! Such excellent service!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Keflavik to Frankfurt,Dec-21,4,5,5,,,4,4,yes,8,"  Keflavík to Frankfurt in Business Class in an A320neo. Business Class seating is similar to Economy but with the middle seat left vacant. Service was attentive and efficient, as we have come to expect from Lufthansa. The flight was on time. Unfortunately, most of the A320neo aircraft in the Lufthansa fleet are without WiFi and I hope the company addresses this issue soon."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Mumbai,Dec-21,3,5,5,4,4,4,4,yes,7,"  Frankfurt to Mumbai in Business Class on an A340-300. Lufthansa's aging A340 aircraft together with its dated Business Class product seems Stone Age compared to its competition, especially when you look at carriers such as Qatar and ANA. Lufthansa excels is in the service department - staff are efficient and warm. The food served was also very good by airline standards."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Washington to Dusseldorf via Frankfurt,Dec-21,,,,,,,2,no,1,"  I booked my flight 6 months ago and around 2 month ago I got the first e-Mail with the information that my flight was canceled and rescheduled. I called Lufthansa Customer service and there was a very nice man who helped me to rescheduling my flight. A month later, my flight was rescheduled twice, without letting me know, I only saw it because I checked the Lufthansa app. Then last week I got another e-Mail that my flight was canceled again, though I called the Customer Service again. First I tried 6 times, the computer hung up on my every time, then I tried it very early in the morning on the next time and I had to wait for 35 minutes until someone picked up.  The woman was not very friendly, I told her my story and she gave me a new flight and muted herself for around 5 minutes without letting me know. I was talking and asked if someone is still there etc no answer, then she unmuted herself for 2 second and was muted again. I am really disappointed."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,,Dec-21,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa refunded me less than 10% for having to cancel my parents' flights because of the shut down of Austria due to the vaccine resistant Covid variant. I have appealed this twice and they have told me I was given what I deserved, yet their public statement is that they ""care for the safety of their passengers"" which is evidently not true."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Berlin via Frankfurt,Sep-21,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Boston to Berlin via Frankfurt. There is no customer service at Lufthansa. They will claim that you can rebook or have a refund of your ticket because of COVID travel changes but this is a blatant lie. The worst part was trying to get in contact with them - I do not have an international phone company so I could not call them. I spent two weeks waiting for a response to my emails - nothing. I had to have a friend in the US call, and even then they wouldn't rebook. The wanted to rebook a flight without refunding or giving me a voucher at all, and charge me over 1000$. I will never, never fly with them again, which is too bad, because the flight itself wasn't bad. They want to take your money and give you nothing for it."
✅ Trip Verified ,CR9,Business,Business Class,Sibiu to Amsterdam via Munich,Dec-21,3,5,5,,,4,4,yes,8,"  Before Covid I regularly flew Lufthansa. Maybe not the most easy going airline, maybe not the best food, but dependable and with loads of smaller destinations in Eastern Europe. I was pleasantly surprised. Both going to Sibiu and returning, Lufthansa out did my expectations. Checkin was fast. everywhere the QR code was checked. The lounge at München airport was good, not too full with a decent selection of food and drinks. The ground staff was nice and the air hostesses; chatty and helpful. Seating on European routes is not that good, but with flight times under 1,5 hours that's not really a problem. The food was the most pleasant surprise, with fine regional German food, presented in an attractive way. When I mentioned this to one of the cabin crew, she told me that the offerings had recently been upgraded."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Hong Kong,Dec-21,,,,,,,2,no,1," We booked flights with Lufthansa in February to travel over Xmas. We had 6 small flight changes, all fine. We then received an email asking us to call (a premium number) where we were told our last connecting flight had been cancelled and were offered an alternative that left before our other flight had arrived. I explained this was not an alternative and was told there was nothing they can do. I was told to cancel, which would have cost us over £2000 extra due to now booking last minute. I was hung up on 4 times by various agents (including one who just started taking other customer calls with me on the phone line). Eventually we managed to rebook with an increased travel time of 12 hours and after having spent 4 hours on the phone at 40p per minute over 3 days. The customer service is appalling. I have also complained via their email complaint line and have been told someone will get back to me 5 times in the last 4 weeks and have heard nothing."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Tampa, FL, USA to Dublin, Ireland",Sep-21,4,5,5,4,4,4,2,no,2,"  Probably the worst customer service. The actual flight was perfectly fine and I had no issues with it whatsoever. However, circumstances arose where I needed to re-book the flight (not cancel, although one should be allowed to cancel a flight during the middle of a pandemic and receive a significant portion of their money back) with Lufthansa for a different day and customer service was shambolic at best. Long wait times to talk to someone with a very hard to understand and thick accent only to be told that the flight I was requesting to change to, which was a cheaper flight, would actually cost $500 more despite initially paying for tickets that allowed you to change your flight without crazy fees. When pressed as to why the flight would be more expensive when anyone can look it up and see the cost vs. what I paid initially, there was obviously no response. Queue being put on hold again and then being hung up on leads to this review. Lufthansa makes it easy and oh so pleasant to take you money with flat pandemic platitudes (re-book easily with no fees) but they are an absolute nightmare when such circumstance arise."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Frankfurt via Newark,Nov-21,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,no,4,"  We always fly United however for this trip, we were unable to use United so we booked Lufthansa. The attendants were mostly helpful. However, one attendant was cold and stoic. At the end of a long flight, we asked what carousel to go to for our luggage. The attendant said she didn't know and told us to keep moving on. Also, the online app did not work so we had to wait in a very long line in order to show our documents. When we finally got to the front, we were told we had to check our carry on luggage. One piece was ""2 pounds over"" and the other was ""4 pounds over."" I will never use this airline again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico city to Moscow via Frankfurt,Dec-21,4,2,1,4,,4,3,no,4,"  Lufthansa still flies you from point A to point B and it’s good news. Also, they do it efficiently - the delays are within normal limits, the luggage has arrived on time, the check-in process was okay and the aircraft was modern and quite comfortable. As for the in-flight service - it has changed for the worse so dramatically that from now on I will try to avoid flying Lufthansa. I used to fly transatlantic several times a year and Lufthansa was always a good option - not anymore. On a 12-hour flight from Frankfurt to Mexico City (10,5 hours backwards) they don’t even offer meal options anymore! They just shove you a vegetarian pasta which is edible but unsatisfying. The “breakfast” is also vegetarian, both times it was a tortilla with cheese filling, it was cold and stale and I couldn’t eat it though I was hungry. On the 3-hour flight from Frankfurt to Moscow they don’t even serve free drinks - they give you a 300ml bottle of water a tiny chocolate bar at the end (you can grub several if you are really starving). Coffee and probably some snacks you can buy from them - that’s how it works now. In general, food service is a disgrace and the flight attendants are polite but very abrupt. With their masks on, they are like robots - gone is all the niceness and kindness and good humour. All they care about is that your mask is covering your nose properly at all times. It’s more like a sanitary convoy, not a service, and that was the impression throughout all 4 flights with them that I’ve had recently. For comparison, my colleagues were flying the same route with other airlines and literally everybody mentioned better food that I’ve had and a friendlier service. So, I am disappointed and will try to avoid flying Lufthansa in the future."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Frankfurt,Nov-21,5,5,,,,5,5,yes,10,"  LH827 CPH-FRA CPH check in fast. Had to walk what seemed a infinity to the Gate. Flight had a gate change. Inside the aircraft it was roasting hot. Landed in FRA on time, and bags took a long time to get out on to the luggage carousel. Lufthansa is okay for Euro Domestic trips."
Not Verified ,E190 / A333,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Seattle via Frankfurt,Nov-21,3,4,3,3,2,3,4,yes,8,"  Didn’t really have any expectations before flying, especially in covid times but was reasonably pleased with Lufthansa. Outbound flight from BHX to FRA was half full so had lots of spare seats. A bottle of water was provided with some chocolates. FRA to SEA was 60% full so we were able to move around the cabin and find seats with more space. The crew were really friendly and when serving drinks told us to have two as they weren’t coming back for a while. The food was standard ok. The return flights were a lot fuller and the crew came round less often but this wasn’t a problem given it was a night flight. My only gripe is the IFE system on the a333. There were two different systems - one that was similar to a tablet and one that was a sort of tv. The former was fine but the latter was so laggy that you touched the screen and it choose a different option. This meant passengers were poking the screen meaning that those sat in front of them were disturbed. I do wonder whether covid has been used to reign back the food and drink options"
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Budapest to Toronto,Nov-21,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,  I was sitting at the back of the aircraft. They ran out of bread before they got to me. Lunch was a sub-par vegetarian snack wrap with cheese. Worst part is they lost my luggage. No word 24h after my flight. When I called the line they told me they weren’t sure were my luggage was but that it might still be in Frankfurt. I was offered no type of compensation even though I was forced to purchase new clothes so that I could go to work. I’m no longer in Toronto and have no idea when I will receive my luggage.

Since I arrived from Frankfurt there were 3 flights with same destination but for some reason my luggage was not in any of these flights. I had all my stuff there that i need on daily basis, I spend money to buy new, was not able to work and seems company doesn't care at all for passengers and what they are going to do without their stuff. As well its impossible to contact Lufthansa as no one pick up phone as well no one reply to emails. I hope that i will receive my baggage at least, what might not be the case. Highly do not recommend this company!"

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Geneva to Mexico via Francfort,Oct-21,4,1,1,4,,5,2,no,3,"  Very bad experience on this flight to Mexico City. No Gin-Tonic on board. Sitting with my wife in the middle row, they were not able to serve dinner at the same time. I got my menu when my wife had finished hers. The presentation of my main meal was disgusting. When asking the flight attendant what happened she just explained that there was a problem when charging the food at the airport. They didn’t show me the wine bottle but just bring you a glass of wine."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London Heathrow to São Paulo via Frankfurt,Nov-21,4,1,2,3,,1,3,no,3," Worst business class experience ever. Negative - Inept, arrogant inflight service. Clumsy at times (one of the other passengers got soaked in red wine by a clumsy flight attendant), utterly clueless mostly (they ignored me for hours, ""forgetting"" to serve food drink or water) Flight attendants and other staff have difficulties restraining their contempt for the customers. Glossy menus but hardly any items on the menu available. Boarding experience is a mess. Staff takes pleasure in giving business class customers a hard time. Outdated business class cabin without any privacy or aisle access Not enough wash rooms in the cabin. Long queues throughout the flight. Positive Lounges are stylish (food could be better in LHR, lounge in FRA is fine). Flights were on time. No luggage was lost. Comfortable seat with ample leg room, had a good night’s sleep."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Miami to Kyiv via Frankfurt,Jul-21,5,5,5,5,,5,5,yes,10,"  
I would like to thank Lufthansa and its airport crew Cristian Lenz. He is a life saver! On 13-14th of July, 2021 my family and I had to fly Lufthansa Miami - Frankfurt - Kyiv with 2 month old baby, but our flight from Miami delayed for 2+ hours because of weather conditions, we missed our next flight, so, in Frankfurt we asked to give us any flight even through other Germany city, just to get home faster at the same day, so, we've got such a flight with extra city. We were so much tired, with a so little baby, so many and hard flights. At that (third) city (i don't remember which exactly, it was just for transition), we were already exhausted. We forgot my small bag at the airplane with my phone, documents, bank cards, money ut already couldn't return for it. I was in panic, cause in 1.5h we had another flight, to Kyiv. I, with a little baby on my hands, saw an airport crew guy - Mr Lenz, told him about my trouble. Truth be said I didn't think he can help, i thought he sends me to the special service for finding things  as most are doing.. But he said: don't worry, take care of your kids, I will get it for you. I was very happy. The airplane already wasn't at the place, Cristian did real magic and found that my bag before our next flight. I appreciate it so much! I even don't know what we would do, especially with 2 month old baby, who was already very tired. I'm so grateful this Person for His heart and willing to help. Also want to admit the stewardesses on the flight from Miami - they were so attentive, helped much with the baby, changed our row to a one with the extra space and baby bed.. we enjoyed that flight. Thank you!"

Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,San Fransisco to Islamabad via Frankfart,Oct-21,3,1,1,1,2,1,1,no,1,"  I have had better experience in an economy class on many airlines than Business Class on this airline. Horrible service, worst food and incredibly unfriendly. The flight attendant on my side was picking and choosing who he wanted to give his attention to and I was not one of them. He gave out 4 hygiene utility bags to people in front of me but not to me. I asked if I could have some fruit as I was going to the washroom and he told me that he didn't have any fruit to offer but on my way back to my seat I noticed that couple on the first row had a bowl of fruit in front of them.  The entertainment was not good either. I couldn't wait to get off the plane. I was not expecting his from a German company. Never flying them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Buenos Aires,Nov-21,1,1,1,3,,2,1,no,1,"  Some of the passengers didn’t wear the protective mask: the staff didn’t care much for that. Meal service is very basic. For dinner they only offered one option and it was vegetarian. No second option.  During the flight they offered only water: no crackers, no fruit, no sandwiches. Seats are cramped and toilets were dirty. I cannot recommend this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mexico City to London via Frankfurt,Nov-21,1,5,1,1,,5,1,no,3," Flight departed late, causing me to miss my connecting flight. At Frankfurt, I was sent to a different terminal to talk to customer service, meaning I had to go through security twice before being issued a new boarding pass for a flight five hours later. The legroom is also extremely small for a transatlantic flight - just a regular-sized backpack placed under the seat in front of me meant that I had no space for my legs in a 10-hour flight, and I was also brushing against the person sitting next to me the whole flight even though I'm extremely thin. The food was disgusting. The cabin and ground staff were all very pleasant and helpful, which was the only positive thing about my experience flying with Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Frankfurt,Sep-21,1,2,3,3,,1,1,no,1,"  We paid extra for the choice to select our seats and on two different occasions, they were erased from record. After a total 14 hours of time on hold/talking with customer service we finally were able to confirm (we hoped) that our seats were together and where we selected them/paid extra for. The communication with Lufthansa and their partner airlines were horrible. Lack of information was shared, false details were relayed to us. We finally boarded our overnight flight from Denver to Frankfurt, but the AC was broken and it was 86 degrees in the cabin. They made no effort to rectify the horrible overnight (9 hour) flying experience.  My baggage was lost in Italy and the process for getting it back was long and stressful. Finally after 6 days, while calling to confirm 5x a day I was able to get my work equipment back.  I've tried to contact Customer Relations, but as of today it's been 25 days without a response from them. "
Not Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to London via Frankfurt,Nov-21,3,2,2,,,2,3,no,5,"  The first leg BER-FRA was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft. The flight is completely full and the boarding was chaotic without much prioritisation of the Group number. Most passengers brought along huge cabin luggage. The gate staff announced to encourage passengers to check their bags free of charge, but they didn’t go out of their way to pick some obviously large and oversized bags. Once onboard, the overhead bin filled up quickly. Cabin crew were standoff-ish, saying that it was not their job to facilitate the space arrangement.  The flight was further delayed because passengers continued to run up and down the aisle to find space. Once arrived in Frankfurt, there was nobody at the gate to facilitate connecting passengers, so everyone ran for themselves. My second flight FRA-LHR was also further delayed for unknown reasons. Upon boarding, I was told to go to another gate staff to have my documents checked for COVID & locator form etc. The other staff  refused to do it because it wasn’t her duty, whilst the one holding that duty was nowhere to be found. Once onboard, again, similar situation with the overhead bin space reoccurred, but this time the male steward were slightly more hands-on than the previous flight, but they still could do more. This trip wasn’t the first time I encountered LH cabin crew staff’s attitude towards assistance with the overhead bin space. Since before COVID, I’ve gradually switched from BA to LH as my preferred full-service airline, but the LH cabin crew attitude is making me think twice on my future flights, especially LH has now scaled down the inflight catering whilst BA started to offer some free stuff

The company canceled the inbound flights twice where I had to call multiple times to have them rescheduled. Within one week of our travel, they canceled (again) the last leg. When I called (again), this time, I was told that the full ticket was canceled and, there were no other available flights for November or December. The free flight change would only cover flights to the same destination within 7 days of the initial booking dates. If I would like to reschedule for January onwards, I would have to pay 1100 Euro per passenger. Or, according to customer support, the best option was to get a refund and book the flights with another company. Being close to Christmas (a peak period) increased our travel costs by more than three times. Even worse, we are traveling because of our wedding ceremony scheduled for December 4, 2021, limiting our flexibility options. We had to postpone our wedding for more than one year due to the pandemic scenario and, now we receive this unpleasant ""gift"" from Lufthansa, which will add stress and increase costs. Thank you, Lufthansa, for such a disgusting treatment. I will never fly with Lufthansa again in my life and, to all of my contacts and social media, I will strongly recommend avoiding this company at all costs. It looks like Lufthansa is going through some profound challenges. They show no care or respect for their customers. My advice is to choose any other company to fly."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Kiev,Nov-21,4,5,5,,1,5,5,yes,10,"  After one month rest from the previous experience I decided to give LH a second try and flew from FRA to KBP this week. Last time it was from Munich. My feeling is that I was flying two different airlines then and now. Online check in worked well and produced a mobile boarding pass. Automated bag drop at FRA took 3 minutes and was flawless with nice staff on help if you need it. Check in counter (I had to correct some info) gave me all required help and with smile. At the gate everything was in perfect order and well communicated. Onboard crew were cheerful and served in a very professional manner. I purchased a sandwich which was good quality and not overpriced. Wifi worked with no internet access (strange kind of service, but luckily my card was not charged). Flight was on schedule both out and in. Disembarkation was fast. Bag on the belt in 5 minutes. Miles on the account next morning. What else would one want?"
✅ Trip Verified ,A321neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Cairo to Paris via Frankfurt,Nov-21,1,1,1,,,3,2,no,3,"  A320neo, 4.30h flight without entertainment, no seat adjustment possible, no usb charger, no wifi, the catering was an inadequate old wrap, crew more or less in a bad mood. Spending almost 5 hours on a night-flight in an upright position without blanket, pillow, or service? "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Business Class,Brussels to Frankfurt,Oct-21,1,2,1,,1,2,1,no,2,  I used to enjoy the food served on Lufthansa business class flights. On short flights it were often just a few bites very nicely presented which gave you the feeling to be a well treated guest by them (and you also always paid the high price for it). On the most recent short haul flights I took with Lufthansa I was shocked the food served in business class has been downgraded while ticket prices are as high or even higher as ever before. The food served on my business class flights were uninspired tasteless sandwiches. They looked similar to the sandwiches Lufthansa used to serve in Economy until a few months ago. If this is their strategy to attract full fare paying guests in Business they really got it wrong. It’s an absolute disgrace for people paying so much money expecting a standard above average. If this is the new Lufthansa I may as well consider flying low cost for my next flights and just pay for food sold on board. It would be a massive saving
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Helsinki to Sao Paulo/ via Frankfurt,Oct-21,3,1,1,3,,1,1,no,1,"  HEL-FRA-GRU 2nd September, GRU-FRA-HEL 19th October. Flights were on time. Could find 2-3 movies politically incorrect enough to be worth checking.  No meal HEL_FRA, inedible dinner. All flights had dozens of maskless people, for example 4 right in front of me. Crew remained passive in this regard, even after pointing this out. In fact, on both 747 legs, one of them had an unfitting mask not covering his nose. Preflight nobody could be contacted by phone. Had I known how reckless Lufthansa is in regard to covid pandemic, I would have canceled my flights. For those who do not care, bring your own food. 11 hours is a long time without a meal."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Ankara via Munich,Oct-21,3,1,1,1,1,3,1,no,1,"  They give pasta (macaroni) for meal both on the flight to go Los Angeles and going back. Also I have connected flight from Ankara to Munich they give nothing even water. I had never experience like this. also they don’t want to give me second beer, hostess are rude and dour. "
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Barcelona,Oct-21,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Munich to Barcelona. The flight attendants did not help us at all and they were the opposite to resourceful. The person who was supposed to help us locate our luggage didn’t even attempt to solve the problem that we had. She just kept ignoring our problems. Moreover, the flight was more than an our late without any type of explanation. This airline is just incompetent and not resourceful to say the least."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Mumbai,Oct-21,3,3,2,4,4,3,3,no,6,"  Took flight from Frankfurt to Mumbai last week. Food was pathetic, on the name of covid and less crew. No fresh snacks were served or nonveg food was given, failed to understand the reason behind it. No much options in food in spite of charging high. Seats were ok but little congested cabin for long journey. Lots of scope in improvements."
✅ Trip Verified ,A359,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Newark to Munich,Oct-21,3,2,2,,,1,2,no,5, Extremely disappointing. At gate they wanted Vax info even though UAL had uploaded to itinerary. On boarding no welcome beverage or real welcome. No menu provided. Table setting consisted of a cloth tossed at our table. Meager amenity pack. Mediocre food. Not very comfortable bed. 1970's coach with a flat bed.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Saint Petersburg,Oct-21,2,2,1,,,1,1,no,2," I am a frequent flyer with Lufthansa since more than 25 years. Living close to their German hub, I use this airline for world-wide travels, both for business and private needs. In the past, the airline delivered not perfect but pretty good services as on the ground as well in the air. The last 5 years the situation has changed drastically. I had multiple serious issues on the ground and in the flight, when Lufthansa staff demonstrated a full ignorance or arrogance to the passengers. The numerous complains to the support line result in formal response without any real measures. The COVID pandemics worsened this disaster service even to more catastrophic. I could provide my personal tens of examples how the Lufthansa employees treat the customers in bad manner, starting from business lounges and further at boarding and in airplane, however, this review is not aimed to make a long story but just to express the general status of the services by Lufthansa. Last but not least, recent changes in price policies and in-flight services just confirm the general trend of company degradation. For example, on some international flights longer than 2 hours (flight FRA-LED), which I recently used, there is no more complimentary food/drinks service. The ticket price, however, increased! As a summary, using often other air carriers, I have to say that Lufthansa is rather located in the very end of the list of quality providers."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Belgrade via Frankfurt,Sep-21,4,5,,,,5,5,yes,9," As always with Lufthansa I had no problem with this flight. The flights were on time and planes were clean. I still don't like to fly with mask on my face, hope this end soon."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Stuttgart to Budapest via Munich,Oct-21,3,3,1,,,3,3,no,1,"  I had booked Stuttgart to Budapest via Munich. That's what I got and LH initially confirmed. On check in, the flight from STR to MUC had been cancelled and I was rebooked to fly through FRA (what I wanted to avoid). Flight STR to FRA was delayed by more than 45 min, I only made the connection in FRA because the gate was just across and because also FRA to BUD was delayed. My luggage, though, didn't catch the flight and was only delivered during the night. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to Frankfurt,Sep-21,5,5,5,2,1,4,4,yes,10,"  Boeing 737-8 business class is excellent. Seats are comfortable, love the storage area for window seats in Business Class. Extremely competent and friendly flight attendants attending every need throughout the flight. This includes disassembling a seat to recover my lost glasses - not a simple task for complex full recline seats in Business class. Above average meals. Only complaint was that the USB port did not have enough power to charge my iPad or even keep it from discharging (albeit slowly)."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Frankfurt,Sep-21,4,5,3,4,,5,5,yes,9,"  It's been some years since I've flown Lufthansa long-haul, and I have to preface this by saying I was extremely lucky with a more than half-empty flight. The 747-8 is a gorgeous airplane and I do hope Lufthansa continues to fly them even as others discontinue this awesome Jumbo. Check-in : Easy, friendly service. In-Flight Service : Very friendly and accommodating as Lufthansa has been in the past. Seat-Comfort - Due to the half empty flight, I was happily able to stretch out. However, even in a full flight, the seat would have been above average by economy standards. I can recommend the mini-economy cabin in front of economy plus on this particular plane. Food/Beverages - Good selection of beverages. Meals were fine (Ravioli for dinner and a sandwich box for breakfast), but nothing special by economy standards. No choice food alternative choice was provided. Entertainment - A bit of a more dated touch system, that was a bit sticky to navigate, but overall a good selection. WIFI - Offered, but not used by myself. Overall one of the better long-haul USA-Europe flights I've been on."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Moscow to Newark via Frankfurt,Sep-21,2,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  Moscow to Newark via Frankfurt. Flight from Moscow to Frankfurt. At the check-in counter they the rep said that I have to pay for my luggage even though, it was paid at the time of the ticket purchasing. The shift supervisor stated that their computer does not reflect my luggage was prepaid and that I have to go to the company cashier window and get some kind of proof that this is the case. Finally, after standing in line to see the cashier I managed to get the required number that proves my luggage was prepaid. Why are you asking your customers to prove that they paid for the luggage? Is booking number should be enough to see the whole info? Flight from Frankfurt to Newark my food was horrible. The flight attendants are rude. During meal time when I was trying to eat and answered her question about my choice of drink she asked me to put on my mask for the reason. ""because you are talking to me""."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Austin to Frankfurt ,Sep-21,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I booked a 4 leg round trip with Lufthansa a month ago. A week back I got an email notice that they have cancelled the flights in 3 legs of the 4 leg round trip. They gave me an option for an intermediate leg that starts about 6 hours later from Frankfurt and options to cancel it and ask for a refund. I cancelled an intermediate leg as it is of no use as I cannot magically transport myself to Frankfurt and have my luggage automatically loaded in the aircraft for an onward journey. When I clicked refund my ticket, it errors out on their site and asks you to contact their customer service. I have been on hold for more than 2 hours on three separate occasions and yet unable to get in touch with their customer service. An email sent to their customer service to process my refund came back with a canned response from a DONOTREPLY email address. I have started the process of disputing the charge through my credit card company because according to their flight cancellation email I am entitled to a refund, just there is not way to request a refund online or via phone. I have searched online and there are numerous customers with the same experience.  Spare yourself the headache of forced flight cancellation and inability to request refunds."
Not Verified ,A32N,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Kyiv via Munich,Aug-21,2,4,,,,1,2,no,2," Paris to Kyiv via Munich with carry-on only. The good news first. Both flights were on time. Both planes were clean. Both crews were courteous. Then the bad news time comes. Online check in was disabled. I arrived to check in desk at CDG2B 3 hours before departure (guessed that all who normally use online check in should be already there). My guess was just partly correct. Not just all Lufthansa, but also Swiss, Austrian and some other airlines sadly shared 3 or 4 staffed desks to check in all the flights to Munich, Frankfurt, Zurich, Vienna and God knows where else. The queue was endless and moving in the slowest possible pace. Things looked quite scary, so I opted to go directly to business class check in with my Turkish frequent flyer card (unsure whether eligible for that). After some 25 min of wait (at business class line folks) I was checked in and given tags for my carry-on.  Boarding was a mess. Calling passengers by groups (to lessen physical contact I guess) gate agents then asked everyone to form a standing queue near the gate door within a small space providing close physical contact. Then the gate door opened, so people were able to board, and without airline staff guidance things got back to normal. Onboard it was ok. The seat back recline has been eliminated since new A320NEO came to fleet, so seat comfort is now not on par with low cost carriers. A bottle of water and wet napkins were handed out. We took off and landed on time. Disembarkation in Munich also went by groups. It slowed things down, but not badly. Then boarding flight to Kyiv was another stupid quest. Without any announcement all the passengers were re-directed to another gate. There instead of boarding we had to get our boarding passes stamped. But with stamped boarding passes instead of boarding the plane we were diverted to the initial gate where they were trying to enforce boarding by groups ignoring the fact that stamping passports was not done by groups, so they were finally able to form quite a big disorganized crowd. Boarding took forever and some more covid infection was spread in this interesting way. Onboard it was uneventful. Overall disorganized, incompetent on the ground, uncomfortable in the air, overpriced and unworthy. I tried their inflight wireless. My CC was charged granting me access to Wi-Fi with no Internet available. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 748,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Thessaloniki via Frankfurt,Sep-21,3,1,1,2,,1,1,no,1,"  I'll never fly LH again after this trip. Transatlantic service is abysmal: only 1 drink service, with beer/wine being the sole alcoholic offering, then nothing but water available till breakfast, which consists of a tiny fruit salad and stale muffin. As for dinner, my pasta was inedible. European flights only offer free water. Even bags on transatlantic flights are now charged. Inflight TV set hardly worked and barely anything worth watching. I used to look forward to flying LH, now I'll avoid them like the plague."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Lagos to Dallas via Frankfurt,Aug-21,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," Lagos to Dallas via Frankfurt. I bought this ticket for my 13 year old son to travel from Lagos to Dallas Fort Worth in Texas but because the airline could not provide the unaccompanied minor services required for the travel. This ticket was cancelled same day it was purchased (August 17, 2021) It has been a pain in the neck for me to get my refund of $1158.05. The refund was processed by Lufthansa staff and I have been calling practically every week to find out when this refund will be put back in my account. It is 34 clear days and 24 working days since I requested the refund. Sometime I have to stay on the phone for upward of 1 hour before getting to talk to someone on the phone without getting any clue when my money will be refunded. Today I have called 3 times and and after staying on hold for 15 minutes, the call goes dead without anybody coming to the phone. It is been extremely frustrating for me to get my money and I am starting to think Lufthansa will not refund this money. I will advise anybody buying international travel ticket to think twice, explore all other options before settling for Lufthansa. It's been a nightmare. Anyone knows how best to resolve this issue. Me and my family, friends and associates are all done with Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to Vancouver,Aug-21,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  My daughter was denied boarding.  The adventure began already in the night before the flight when I tried to check-in my daughter electronically. This was not successful, because electronic check-in of LH asks whether or not a visa is available. In an exchange program, there is no visa, however, but an ""application approval"" and the visa is issued at the local airport upon arrival. Such a possibility is, unfortunately, not available within the electronic check-in at LH and electronic check-in could, therefore, not be performed. We arrived at the airport 4 hours before departure. As soon as our flight was indicated, we went to the indicated counters. However, only an electronic check-in was possible there. This check-in did not provide for the possibility to check-in children belonging to the exchange program either. Therefore, we went to the counters where check-in took place physically. After a long line, we were ready to have our documents checked. Although the documents were alright, the women at the counter still had to consult her manager because she was not sure if the documents were in order. When she was back, she confirmed that the docs were alright, but said that it was too late now and the gate had already closed and would not be opened for boarding for my daughter. Despite the fact that there was still over an hour before departure and that all other airlines I have experience with close their gates just before departure, LH refused to accept my daughter. Lufthansa fails to realize that it has a contract with the passengers and that not only passengers have obligations, but also LH has and it is expected to make an effort to find a solution, in particular in a situation which does not really presents a problem. Not to mention any kind of services which is fully missing on the side of LH. All in all, I consider this procedure unacceptable. Two days before departure, I wanted to clarify one more point with LH and called LH's information desk at 23:00. According to the information on LH´s website, the support line is open until midnight. The announcement on the phone was that all the lines were overloaded and the waiting time was 20 minutes. Since the clarification was important to me, I decided to wait. After waiting until 23.50, I hung up. I think that this example about the customer orientation on the part of LH is meaningful enough and no further comments are needed."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340/A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Nagoya to Toulouse via Tokyo/Frankfurt,Aug-21,3,2,2,3,,2,4,yes,5,"  I traveled on a return itinerary from France to Japan with my family of 4. On the outbound flights their cabin crew lost some cabin baggage that they took off us; for storage elsewhere on the plane. On leaving the plane, they said that they would follow up and contact me but I heard nothing. Then they insisted that I fill out an online customer service form - still nothing. The meal service on their long haul flights has been downgraded significantly. I have noted the deteriorating service levels at Lufthansa, in multiple ways. Can Lufthansa still be called them a 5-Star airline? I don't think so."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Los Angeles,Sep-21,3,3,2,4,,2,1,no,4,"  The hard product has for several years been painfully outdated. What was surprising this time around was the nose-dive the soft product has taken, all under the pandemic excuse. The amenity kits were underwhelming. It was explained to me, that, as this was a day flight, there was no reason for the kits to contain earplugs and eye masks. For the same reason, there were no pajamas offered. One alcohol wipe was given to each passenger upon boarding and this seemed to have taken care of all hygiene concerns, as I did not see the bathroom cleaned during the flight. C-class bathrooms contained no amenities. Beverage service was the only thing that seemed to be alright. Food was poorly presented and of a sub-par quality. No snacks were offered between meals, nor were any (or any water) readily available at the galley. No water runs between the meal services. Crew were disengaged, slow, and didn't seem to care much."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Berlin via Frankfurt,Aug-21,3,5,5,3,2,5,3,yes,5,"  I had a connecting flight from Frankfurt to Berlin, which I missed due to the immigration system there. Even after telling the authorities that my Berlin flight has started the boarding, they remained unhelpful. After missing my flight, I went to Lufthansa Service center, they booked me on the next flight which was after 3 hours and my ticket was in the waiting list. After 3 hrs, they told me that they couldn’t confirm my ticket and can put me on the next flight which again is not confirmed. I kept explaining that the delay is not even my fault but that of the immigration. They said everybody is suffering, they can’t do anything. They were very unsupportive. In the end, I had to first fly to Munich and then to Berlin. I had a very unpleasant journey with Lufthansa this time. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320 / A340,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Hong Kong via Frankfurt,Aug-21,4,3,2,4,,3,4,yes,7,"  I value Lufthansa for its reliability and overall good service and have flown with them regularly in the past. I booked a one-way CGD-FRA-HKG trip at the last minute to replace a cancelled Turkish Airlines flight and Lufthansa took me to my destination safely and on time. Check-in at CDG on an August Sunday afternoon was just one long queue for all Lufthansa and Swissair flights (despite buying my ticket online, check-in via the app was disabled). Even arriving two hours in advance, you would have very little time to spare to reach the aircraft given how slow things were going (luckily I was spotted by an airline rep as having no luggage to check in and was moved to the free business counter). The A320 to Frankfurt was new and spotless. The crew went around handing out a single alcohol towelette to each passenger in a great display of hygiene/safety precautions (other airlines give you masks, gel, wipes, etc). Each passenger was given an individual bottle of mineral water  and Swiss-style chocolates. That was it, for an early evening flight. On the FRA-HKG leg, there was no choice of dish for dinner or the usual apology of ""sorry, we have run out of"" -  some penne in tomato sauce. Breakfast was very skimpish and un-German (picture). Lufthansa is really cutting corners on anything but the actual journey I thought."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo / A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Malta,Jul-21,5,5,2,1,,4,2,yes,7,"  Frankfurt to Malta return in July. Service has decreased.  There are no more free drinks and food on European flights in Economy except a small bottle of water and a tiny piece of chocolate. You have to pay for everything else. Nevertheless prices are on a high level. Apart from rather poor service the flight was comfortable with a good crew. A big plus was that the crew took care of Covid-19 rules. I still recommend Lufthansa, but don´t expect too much."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Munich,May-21,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I had booked a flight, and due to covid 19 restrictions of the destination I had to change the date of departure. The airline representative on the phone assured me that after the flight takes place, I'll be able to get a refund ($106) for the seats that I have purchased of the flight that was rescheduled. After the trip I had contacted Lufthansa about 25 times over the phone and just about as many through their email and social media. I requested a refund back in may and was told I will receive money back in 7-10 days. I called back 3 weeks after and they was no idea what refund I was talking about, they stated that there was no ticket for a refund on my account. It took me 3 hours and 4 attempts to get a hold of a live person, since the first 3 either hung up, or put me on a 30 min hold and then hung up, the representative that work for this company have zero respect for customers time and money. I always asked very politely to not disconnect the call and to call me in case we get disconnected. Not a singe Lufthansa representative called me back after hanging up on me. So I finally get to talk to a person and they supposedly create a ticket for the refund of the booked seats ($106) and they again tell me to wait 7-10 days. So I wait, 3 weeks go by, nothing. I call back, on my 7th attempt (and I have records of all these calls I made) I get an agent who tells me that they will escalate this and I need to wait 7-10 days. This took place on august 5th, they reassured me that it's been escalated and I will be getting the money back. Today is august 27th, it's been 3 more weeks, and I received no communication. So I call back, wait on hold for 1 hour. Then the call goes silent for 30 min and this I get hung up on. I have received no response to numerous emails I have sent to their Facebook page. I have emailed Lufthansa explaining the issue and all I got was a generic email template stating that a representative will contact me. And no one has contacted me. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cairo to Munich,Aug-21,1,2,1,1,,3,1,no,2,"  They damaged my bag, I reported the damage, but nobody contacted me even after a month. Old plane (no entertainment, no screens, no AUX plugs for music). Phone customer service is the worst, and when they answer they don't help me. No flexibility when it comes to baggage weight (I cannot really complain about since these are the regulations). I usually weigh everything so it is not a problem for me, but come on try to be good at one thing!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Toronto,Aug-21,5,5,5,5,5,3,4,yes,8,"  LH 470 on 24th of August 2021. Partially due to necessary document checks and partially due to limited physical gate space boarding can only be described as chaotic. Nevertheless the flight deserves high marks. The crew was exceptionally friendly - especially the team being responsible for the smaller business class cabin (rows 7 and 8). Seat comfort was very good - seating arrangement in Business at Lufthansa gets often bad reviews, however I do prefer their open concept to many pod arrangements from other airlines. Food was served speedily and was of excellent quality. Even though the flight was fully booked (actually overbooked due to the need of having to accommodate apparently a cancelled flight to Toronto) crew managed to be very attentive, quick and always friendly. Crew managed to enforce mask rules strictly and they knew how to be assertive while still being respectful and attentive. Would have preferred a bit ""better air quality"" during this fully occupied flight - especially having to be masked at all times"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vilnius to Mexico via Frankfurt,Jul-21,1,1,1,1,,1,1,no,1,"  Out of my flights only 1 was on time (others 30min to 1,5 hours late). For the long flight my food was bad and my entertainment system was unusable (the touch screen is made in the 2000s I guess). The lag is unreal and it restarts every few touches I make.  My last flight to Mexico was canceled without any notify. And the company is refusing to take any responsibility by responding with meaningless mail, and ignoring after I send them another one. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Kerkyra,Jul-21,3,3,1,,,1,2,no,2,"  48 hours before flying, LH requested that we fill up on internet a survey about our Covid status, uploading our double vaccination status. So did we. The day before we received an email denying the validity of our surveys, and adding a lot of stress. At the gate everything was double checked, and was OK. Suddenly a boss decided that passenger documentation had to be checked again (10 mn before boarding time). No explanation was given. Only 2 employees were allocated to that job, and 3 remained smiling and chatting. When more than 50 % of the pax were queuing for this 2nd check, boarding was announced, and panic was installed. Lh does not seem to realize that Covid is already stressing by itself, and that one of the airline duty is to low down the level of stress."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Cairo via Frankfurt,Aug-21,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Horrible beyond imagination. My Flights from Los Angeles were cancelled due to COVID-19, understandable. Flight credits were administered (Through my third party travel agent); however, my seat upgrades needed to be refunded through the airline alone. After 6 months of waiting for my refund, I'm sitting here frustrated, still waiting for my refund. Every other week I am advised to call to check on the status of the refund. I wait on hold for 1 hour to reach an irritated customer service rep. They advise me that they are flagging my refund as top priority and I should receive a refund in 3-5 business days. I give them 2 weeks, call back and start the entire process over again. They cannot credit my account for a future flight. They cannot transfer me to speak with anyone from the refund department and they can no longer tell me when my refund will be available. After flying with Lufthansa for 30 years I am sorry to say my current booked trip in September will be last trip with Lufthansa unless they can rebuild this relationship."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,London to Tbilisi via Munich,Aug-21,,,,,,,1,no,1,  I have had terrible experience exchanging and then seeking refund for Lufthansa's business flexible tickets. Business flexible is a joke. It's neither flexible nor fully refundable. They have a really convoluted system.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Munich,Aug-21,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  After the online checkin was completed by my side on time, I never received any QR code for the boarding pass and upon arrival to the airport, I had to wait in an excessively long queue. Whilst I had no baggage (checkin completed as aforementioned) for 1 hour in order to receive boarding pass. I am a regular flyer from HH to ATH and never had to go through such trouble to fly in the midst of the pandemic, as I always present my documents before flying. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Rome to Santorini via Frankfurt,Jul-21,2,3,1,,,2,3,yes,5," Our luggage delivery was delayed 60 hrs, after it was not boarded on the connecting flight. Reimbursement of essential items expenses was adequate. Needless to say that inconvenience was quite significant. On the return leg, our flight from FRA to FCO was cancelled, but without explanation. Only much later we learnt this was due to the Italian air controllers strike. Would have been good to explain it beforehand in Lufthansa's notification emails, so to reduce concern. Trying to talk with someone at the Service Center proved impossible in those days"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Hong Kong via Frankfurt,Aug-21,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Booking online for your flight, if there are no issues/canceling/rebooking is easy. Their service on the plane itself is OK. However, Lufthansa does not allow rebooking online if your flight gets cancelled or there are complications due to coronavirus. Moreover, if there is a government-imposed travel ban, they will not allow you to have refund (only rebooking, usually at a very high price because the last-minute booking is usually twice or three times the price of the original ticket). Other flight companies allow for refund, but Lufthansa is instructing their call service to deny the refunds and rebooking cannot be done online. To rebook, you need to call their call service, which is a nightmare. I tried to rebook 3 times. First time I was on hold for about an hour. Then, I explained the situation, was put on hold, and after 1 hour of waiting was disconnected from the line. This same thing happened 3 times. The customer service is extremely slow and inefficient."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Atlanta to Edinburgh via New York / Frankfurt,Aug-21,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  This has to be the worst experience I have ever had with an airline and I have held several status with airlines over the years. My wife and I bought tickets for a 10 Day trip to Scotland this year in June to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary. We originally booked with British Airways. Due to the COVID 19 outbreaks, the trip was canceled by the travel company. British Airways promptly refund our money because we cannot get into the country. The trip company off to rebook us again in August, and because of limited routes, we booked the second air trip with Lufthansa instead. Unfortunately, Scotland did not open this August either. I made numerous attempts to contact Customer Service at Lufthansa, but to no avail. I was force to cancel my tickets online, but they only refunded a small portion of the taxes despite the fact they cannot even take me to Scotland.  I am currently out over $7,000 dollars because these were business class tickets that we saved up to purchase. I will never take this airline again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Economy Class,Belgrade to Milan via Frankfurt,Aug-21,3,3,2,,,1,2,no,1,"  I missed the first leg of this flight due to an airport workers strike in Italy so I could not get to Milan on the 27th. I had to buy a new ticket due to this but all flights to Milan were sold out so I chose to fly direct to Rome and then to Belgrade (which I did). On the way back (Aug 1) I caught my flight from Belgrade (FL# LH1411) at 6:00am. The flight was 30 minutes taking off and we were airborne at 6:33am to Belgrade. My connecting flight in Belgrade was also on Lufthansa to Milan. The flight landed at 7:50am, my connecting flight (LH 248) was departing at 9:00am. The Frankfurt airport was crazy busy with very long lines. After deboarding the plane, I ran with computer back and check in luggage in tow to find the connecting gate. The first passport control (8 minutes away) line had about 4 windows open with about 30 people in each line. I asked one of the staff that I have a flight leaving very soon and I will miss it, is there anyway I can get to the front of the line, she said you have to wait. I waited about 10-15 minutes and the line hardly moved. I then went up to the airline staff window and pleaded with the man there that I would miss my plane. He looked at my boarding pass, stamped me and let me through (thank you!). I then ran about 5 minutes more to a send security passport check to get to the connecting gate. I waited in line for about 5 minutes and then was allowed through. I ran to my gate and arrived at 8:50am. I handed the lady at the gate desk my boarding pass and she simply said.. ""The plane has left"".  I asked her how the plane could leave early when they  have a manifest that shows there is a passenger on this plane connecting from a flight from Belgrade. She simply looked at me and said ""I'm sorry the plane is gone"". She then handed me a card that had a Lufthansa website address on it to lodge my complaint. (I have since lodged a complaint, to which Lufthansa replied that they have ""no fault in this"" - Unbelievable!) My question is: How can they simply just leave knowing there is a connecting passenger coming from another flight, and why would they leave 9-10 early!?

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Bari via Frankfurt,Aug-21,3,3,3,3,,1,2,no,2," Flight from Denver to Frankfurt was dirty, despite having delayed departure for cleaning. I opened my tray table and a pile of food crumbs felt into my lap. Bit of chocolate were smashed in places. The flight attendant apologized and gave me a wet towelette to clean it up. The same thing happened with the tray next to mine. They tried to blame the ground staff, but as a customer, this is not my concern. An evidently dirty plane is gross in its own right, even more so during a pandemic, as it raises questions about how safe it is to fly with Lufthansa. Second, my bag did not arrive in my final destination. Strange considering I had one connection in Frankfurt of several hours, which is where Lufthansa's automated system says the bag was held up. I filed a report with the local baggage service at Bari airport, but customer service directly with Lufthansa has been poor/nonexistent. I have not been able to reach anyone on Lufthansa by phone in Germany or the US. The calling service offers no way to leave your phone number for a call back. In fact, the German number simply says to call back later. You don't even get placed in a queue. Overall, the service on Lufthansa has been terrible and very unlike my previous travels with the airline. Very disappointing."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Brussel to Kos via Munich,Aug-21,4,5,5,,,4,4,yes,10,"  Had two very pleasant flights with Lufthansa. Correct times and 2x bottles of water on the flight with a chocolate. Water should be given on all flights since you can't bring your own. They also still announce the take-off with ""ladies and gentlemen"" like it should be."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Cluj via Frankfurt,Jun-21,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Travel with family and our German shepherd dog. We purchased the dog crate according to Lufthansa website specifications. We arrived ahead of time at the terminal. We had all documentation ready. Arrived in Frankfurt and been told that their plane cannot accommodate our dog and crate. Airline representatives called higher up to find a solution other than sending the dog alone on a different route in couple of days. ready. After about an hour they started boarding. Myself and 4 kids went on the plane. Couple minutes later my wife and one daughter called and said they they denied their boarding. I had all documents with me . We arrived in Cluj and four luggage have been missing. About 20 people had missing luggages because the plane was very small and they couldn't fit .They waited 8 hours to take a plane to Bucharest.They had been told that the airline will cover all expenses: airport expenses and transport from Bucharest to Cluj. I had to make arrangements for their transportation. They arrive in Bucharest and from there they travel another 9 hours. Two months passed ,I send multiple emails to Lufthansa customers relations and got no refund, plus the replies I got showed that they didn't even read the emails."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Vilnius,Mar-21,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Paying for Business Saver Class on Lufthansa is a waste of money. 2 weeks before the flight I requested to change the date of the outgoing flight to the day before. It is sold to you that this is possible on the Business Saver Class, with the extra price to be covered by you. Rang up Lufthansa, they wanted to charge me €276 euro as they had no Business Saver seats available, so Business ++ was the only option. I said I would be happy to downgrade to a regular seat, they replied that you can downgrade at the airport, not on the phone, and then tried to get me to pay the €276. Just before I paid i asked will i receive the difference in fair price between the regular class and the business Class already paid. No was the answer."
Not Verified ,,Business,Premium Economy,Philadelphia to Frankfurt ,Sep-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,  This review is not about my last flight but about the terrible customer service I have experienced for more than a year. I tried booking flights 4 times and they cancelled them on me over and over and it takes more than 6 months to reimburse. My last purchase dates of Jan 31st for a flight in April that was cancelled. I am still waiting for the money. Their phone customer service is terrible. They don't even pick up. It's embarrassing.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Beirut via Frankfurt,Jul-21,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,yes,1, Los Angeles to Beirut via Frankfurt. I called Lufthansa and their answering service is so bad. I was on hold for over an hour trying to cancel my return flight due to an emergency. It is very frustrating traveling inbound where they cancel our flight and instead of 4 hours layover we ended up waiting 11 hours and no compensation. This is the worst airline. No consideration for family traveling with kids. As of now I can't cancel my trip and online service doesn't allow you to do so. We should have more reliable service when you have an emergency.
Not Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Frankfurt,Jul-21,4,5,4,5,3,4,4,yes,8,"  My wife and I were given economy class seats aboard LH 457 to Frankfurt. Check in was methodical. I had on a cloth mask and was told I could only wear disposable masks on board the aircraft, the flight attendant gave me a fresh new disposable mask. Seat comfort was marginal at best, typical economy class seats for a long 10 1/2hr flight. Service was prompt and efficient. Dinner was a pasta with sauce palatable but I've had better. Breakfast prior to landing was a sandwich. Flight attendants very efficient. The 747-8 provided a very smooth flight albeit with some minor turbulence over the Atlantic. This aircraft had the old familiar livery of LH which I actually prefer to their new livery. Landing was smooth, deplaning very interesting. Passengers were required to remain seated until their rows were called to deplane which actually made existing the aircraft very organized and orderly unlike the US carriers where it's every one for themselves. All in all a very good flight from LAX to FRA. Food offerings could stand some improvement though."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Brussels to Newark via Frankfurt,Jul-21,1,1,1,2,,1,1,no,1,"  I originally booked a direct return flight from Brussels to JFK for July 25th. My flight was supposed to be at 10.35AM. The day before the flight on July 24th, I went online to do my check in and just want to make sure everything is okay then I noticed Lufthansa had cancelled my flight without booking me another flight back to the US, meanwhile, I paid for round trip. So I spent last day of my vacation 4 hours on the phone trying to solve this issue. First, it’s so hard to find a valid number to call Lufthansa for customer service. When we finally found a number to call, then it says they only work Monday to Friday. Long story short, I finally was able to rebook my flight for July 25th at 9.10AM. Boarding is so slow and inefficient. We were supposed to leave at 9.10AM but we did not leave until 9.40AM due to slow boarding. I originally paid/ booked premium economy seat, while they rebook me they downgrade my seat to regular economy. Then I have a connection flight from frankfurter to JFK at 11.00AM. While in the air I asked a crew member that I have connection flight if I can still make it and she said yes, if I ran. I ran through the immigration and I asked the guy who worked at the immigration again if he thinks I can make it then he told me he doesn’t think so because of the gate is very far, the farthest gate it’ll take me about 10+ mins if I run (Z68). When I finally ran to the gate, airline employees told me the boarding has closed. I missed my flight while my other fellow American who ran with me said while they were told this connection flight will wait for us. Then we were told there is no more flight out to NY JFK anymore for the day. We can either wait until tomorrow or go to Newark NJ. (But my car is parked at JFK long term parking). Then we have to go to another gate (Z12) to the counter in order to rebook our flight. Anyway, so I took that flight at 1:20PM (again they put me in regular economy while I paid for premium economy). Because of the whole chaos that Lufthansa put me through now I end up in Newark. So I have to figure out an Uber home or arrange pick up by friends while I have my own car parked at JFK where I booked my final destination to. Lufthansa, are you paying my one extra day of long term parking? Are you going to refund me the cost difference between premium economy to regular economy? "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bucharest to Nur-Sultan via Frankfurt,Jul-21,3,5,5,5,,5,5,yes,10,"  In 2020, when every other airline was trying to cheat me, Lufthansa went above and beyond and gave me even better terms than my contract entitled me too. They were also rather gracious when I showed up with oversized luggage, and did not charge me extra, although they could have. Of all the airlines I've been flying with, this is the one one that I have no complaints about."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Economy Class,Berlin to Lyon via Frankfurt,Jul-21,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Impossible to join them on the phone.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Vancouver to Frankfurt,Jul-21,2,1,2,3,4,1,1,no,4,  Very mediocre hard and soft product for price paid. No choices for food were available by they time the got to me despite half the cabin being upgraded and getting their choice. I had to remind staff multiple times to get service like refills. Ground service also was unaware of latest covid rules for destination wasting about 30 minutes of my time. I was disappointed by the dirtiness of my seat departing from Vancouver. 
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Portland to Larnaca via Seattle and Frankfurt,Jul-21,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,no,1,"  Worst airline ever. Online portal is horrible and feels dated. Not something from a giant airline. Could not check in online or at my first gate and was told I would have to go through security at Seattle to go out and print my ticket. Booth was almost empty, one nice employee helped me but then I risked missing my flight. Because of this, I had a terrible seat as well during the pandemic. Avoid at all costs. Never flying with them again."

I was wrong. Despite a lot of empty fingers, flight from MRS was parked in a remote position. Disembarking was very slow due to COVID, bus was late, and it took hours to arrive at T ""A"" and we nearly missed a 1h15 connection."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Atlanta to Budapest via Frankfurt,Jul-21,2,4,2,2,,2,1,no,2,"  The flight time was changed several times without letting us know. The first change was the departure from Budapest. Although we did not make any changes, the tickets were not rebooked as we initially bought them: we paid for one checked luggage on our way to the USA, and 4 checked bags on our way back. NONE of our paid luggage were reflected in the system when we made it to the airport. We bought 6 tickets but we had to cancel one free or charge and full refund (due to the covid regulation) and although we’ve been promised to be fully refunded in one week after cancellation even after 4 weeks we still did not receive the refund. When my husband called, was a waiting time of 30 min. On our way back to Budapest, our arrival in Budapest was supposed to be around 10:25 am based on the itinerary we received. Instead of that, we found out we had to wait over 4 hrs in the airport. Nobody told us that we will never make it home by 10:25 am! We felt deceived and taken for granted or taken advantage of."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Istanbul via Frankfurt,Jul-21,1,3,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  This flight was a disaster. We had our departure as 6pm july7, and boarding at 5.10pm. When we start boarding it was 7, and we waited one and half hours in the airplane and then told the airplane has issues and we have to go back to gate. We were at the gate at 8.30pm and waited till 10pm at the gate and we are only given 5-6 jellybeans and a very small pack of cheese. It was horrible and then they started to board at 11pm and we finally take the departure at 12.40 am.  We had 6.40 hours of delay and then once we go to Frankfurt, they told us they will handle connection flights, which they literally put everyone on the waitlist. We had transit visa issues and we cannot wait after 12 hours in Germany, they finally gave us a flight at 9pm. We waited for another 6 hours in Frankfurt airport.  Horrible horrible experience and they don’t even care. "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Belgrade to Munich via Vienna,Jul-21,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  They canceled my flight Belgrade to Munich last minute (email at 23:40 at night a day before the flight), then had me fly over Vienna with 5 hours waiting time. Issued a meal voucher on the boarding flight of the flight that’s canceled and not valid. When I called and contacted them though online inquiry, a person from their customer support asked me to provide the boarding passes, meant voucher email and my Miles and More account number (not sure why he needs that but I’ve sent it). I have sent all that he has asked for, they just ignore me. When I followed up I got a reply that I didn’t provide any proof of my flights when I have sent them over 7 files of all boarding passes. They have issues the meal voucher on the canceled flight so nobody could use it. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Business,Business Class,Lyon to San Francisco via Frankfurt,Jun-21,3,5,3,4,3,1,3,no,3,"  Lufthansa email communications are misleading and unreliable. Prior to my flight SFO-FRA i tried to check in as requested by the airline in an email I had received. I answered the various questions only to be told I would not be allowed to travel due to COVID restrictions. This was of course false as I had the required test, vaccination and clearance to travel according to the regulations of my destination (I have an EU passport). On the way back LYS-FRA-SFO the same thing happened: false info from Lufthansa claiming that my newly obtained COVID PCR test was not OK.  Check in at the airport was a disaster - the gate agents were incapable of handling their job. Getting to the plane at the Z gates in Frankfurt with no organization, total disarray, too few staff people. The flights were OK and on-board service was very good though the food was not great. The business class seats on a brand new A350 were inferior to those offered by United on their Boeing 787."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Krakow to Frankfurt,Jun-21,3,3,3,,,1,2,no,1,  This was just a stressful experience. My family and I got to the Krakow airport over 2hrs prior to our flight. During check-in (couldn’t get boarding pass online due to covid) the lady at the window we lined up to was incompetent. It took her forever to print one boarding pass and it looked like she struggled a great deal.  I was so stressed and my flight experience started with my family running for our lives to catch our flight at the gate.
✅ Trip Verified ,A319 / A320,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Tbilisi to London via Munich,Jun-21,1,2,3,,,1,1,no,1,"  Standards are declining rapidly. On my return flight in business class there was only one very long line for check-in. I went to the lounge but then had to use my priority pass since Lufthansa don't have an agreement with the lounge. Very stingy and poor Lufthansa - you can do better! I waited by the gate for boarding, but there were no pre-boarding announcements for business class passengers. The only upside was that I had three seats to myself. Upon arrival in Munich I tried to find the lounge to find it closed. They are selling you services and not even opening them I had to buy my own water at 2.50 EUR. Their customer service have no empathy or interest. They are providing an awful product, way below the standard of other airlines and when you complain the response is ""tough""."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Frankfurt,Jun-21,3,1,1,,,3,2,no,3,"  Longest 10 hours. My food was cold and blend. Very limited entertainment with mono sound headset, I was not able to hear anything. Staff kept waking me up when my mask was below my nose. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Cairo,Jun-21,1,3,3,,,1,2,no,3,"  The lounge was supposed to open at 6am but instead opened at 7am. I came in from a trans Atlantic flight and really wanted to relax during my 4 hour layover. Then, no lounge access unless you had a PCR test 24 before. That doesn’t match the PCR testing times for the flight, so even though I paid for business class I had no lounge access. A completely disorganized boarding procedure (by bus) where business class wasn’t given priority. Then I was forced to board through the back door even though I was in Row 2. I had to shuffle past the people walking in through the front door in the opposite direction to me. Then I got to my seat and this one had no place to charge your electronics. This is a brand new plane (A320neo). Most of the business class cabin was occupied by Lufthansa crew (in uniform) and they were treated better than the paying customers. Shouldn’t you serve the paying customers first so they get first choice of meal selections, etc? No predeparture drink. The food was ok but they only came around with drinks once after the meal (4:10 flight). Overall, a disaster."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Athens to Frankfurt,Jun-21,3,3,1,,,2,1,no,5,"  So Lufthansa now offers no food on board the Athens to Frankfurt flight, unless you decide to pay for their sandwiches and German crumble cake. Why try Lufthansa if you get the same at Ryanair ?"
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Rome to Sofia ,Jun-21,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Be aware of Lufthansa scamming customers by changing their reservations! I booked on-line a round-trip flight within Europe originally for Eu195.37 through the Lufthansa website. Less than 12 hours later, the first Change of Reservation dropped in my email box, informing me that one of my flights was changed to something that was in conflict with my travel/business itinerary. I was forced to change the flight on-line but they asked me to pay the ""price difference"" fee of Eu148.77, which I did after hours of trying to reach the customer support on the phone. Another 12 hours and here comes another Change of Reservation, this time for the other leg of my trip. I quickly checked online how much they would ask in ""price difference"" this time around - another Eu147. This time I did not pay it. I am still on the phone (now for 3 hours) trying to reach their customer support."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,San Francisco to Milan via Frankfurt,Jun-21,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,no,1," Worst USA-Europe flight ever. Low quality food, no choice other than super-spicy spaghetti, which my son did not want to eat. Crew exceptionally rude. Most importantly: we received no prior advice on whether a Covid test was required and which type, so we contacted the call center and were reassured that we would be able to board without a test, though we would have to self-quarantine on arrival. However, when we arrived at the check-in, we were told that a PCR test was required, which we had to do in emergency at the cost of USD 275 x 2 = 550! Shame on Lufthansa!"
✅ Trip Verified ,E190,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Zurich to Pula via Frankfurt,Jun-21,2,3,,,,3,3,no,4," Where is the difference between Lufthansa and no-frills carriers nowadays? Lufthansa: Old and frustrated cabin crew, horrible hard seats on European flights, no more complimentary food and drinks - they now even reduced the size of the complimentary bottle of water you get in Economy. Checked-luggage price on Light fare increased from 25 to 30 CHF. Of course, ticket prices did not decrease: you pay the same or more, but get much less back. A true embarrassment for Germany."
✅ Trip Verified ,A319-100,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Sevilla,Apr-21,2,4,1,,1,1,1,no,3," Lufthansa’s new normal: provide low cost, low quality service while maintaining premium airline fares. Writing this review from LH1140 on 12/06/2021. As a Lufthansa frequent traveler (80 flights year - 80% with Lufthansa) I would have never expected having to pay (EUR13.50) for a Coke and sandwich on a Lufthansa medium haul flight. Shame on you Lufthansa! What’s next? Non reclinabile seats? Pay for breathing on board? Value for money of Lufthansa flights keeps dropping year after year, friendliness of ground staff at Frankfurt airport is close to zero hinting at total lack of training, seats in long haul economy class are worse than in some low cost companies. Seriously considering to stop flying with Lufthansa and hope other travelers do so. In case you are planning a short/medium haul flight with Lufthansa economy class in Europe, bring you own food."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Johannesburg via Frankfurt,Jun-21,2,1,1,1,2,4,4,no,3," This is the first time I flew with Lufthansa with family. I chose Lufthansa for a number of reasons, mainly reputation, route, price, and recommendations by others. I must say I was extremely disappointed. Terrible infotainment system - slow and clunky. Terrible economy seats - they recline but the seat pad does not move forward like others airlines such as Emirates, Turkish, Ethiopian, etc. Many rude flight attendants. Unsurprising given most are German, but still, should be more pleasant. No meal choices. Every other airline I have ever flown has offered at least some food choice ~ meat, chicken, fish, etc. Not Lufthansa! It was pasta with tomato sauce and wasn't even tasty. I sent emails to the Lufthansa customer relations department. Here is the context of my email. We traveled from Frankfurt to Johannesburg on flight LH572, departing on June 3 at 22.05, which lasted approximately 10 ½ hours. During this time, we experienced disrespect, rudeness, and overall unpleasant attitudes and service by some of your flight attendants. We were seated in row 32, seats G, H and K. I understand that food is limited, however, when we inquired if our daughter could have an alternate meal, the female flight attendant blurted out “Everyone has the same thing! If you wanted a special meal, you should have requested it before the flight.” That’s fine, but the insensitive and rude behavior of this flight attendant was not acceptable, by any culture! When the plane pulled into the gate at Johannesburg, the fasten seat belt sign was turned off. I stood up to stretch my legs as I am tall and my knees hurt. Again, this flight attendant shouted at me to “sit down until you are told to get up!” Is this the type of behavior that is tolerated by your airline? Based on reactions from other passengers on this flight, I certainly was not alone in my feeling of disrespect, almost disdain, by some of your flight attendants, as I was not the only passenger she yelled at. Received only a ""canned"" response to my inquiry. Based on this single experience, I'll never fly this airline again."

Horrible dinner, only pasta option due to COVID they said) and mine was overcooked and spicy. I asked for a butter pasta for my kid and they say he has to eat this one. I asked for a cafè because they never offered me one and they told me to drink water instead. My breakfast was a Mayo sandwich. I asked for a glass of wine and they told me that was not possible after service. It was a bad experience and I think I won’t fly with them anymore."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Frankfort,May-21,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Booked a ticket from Boston to Geneva, Switzerland. Due to Covid 19 restriction I was not able to fly from Boston. I tried to call Lufthansa but they are not answering the phone. I sent them email requesting a refund or a voucher to be used later when Switzerland is open for visitors. Lufthansa denied my request and refused to refund or issue a voucher. I had the worst experience dealing with Customer Service and I will never ever use this airline again"
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Singapore via Frankfurt,Jul-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Amsterdam to Singapore via Frankfurt booked for July 2020. The flight did not go (covid 19), but still no refund from Lufthansa. After contact with the call center (very bad spoken English, and sometimes lost connection) we would get a voucher. However we never received a mail or other proof of it. Later tried for a refund again. Without communication we received only the airport tax. But not the price of the 4 tickets (€ 2.160). Now they say that we called our flight off and that the case is closed. However the flight never took place and Singapore was closed for tourists. Very, very bad service from this company. In 2019 we flew with Lufthansa, that will be our last flight ever with them. So the conclusion is that Lufthansa is hiding behind a very poor and bad costumer service. It's a shame that an international company does this. "
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Seattle to Frankfurt,Apr-21,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I had the worst experience ever flying with Lufthansa through Frankfurt! After over 20 years of loyalty, I will never use this carrier. Customer satisfaction is not of concern to this airline. Overcharging and extra fees for a return emergency flight, which caused by their negligence during boarding, is their business standard that I've experienced, while dealing with multiple agents on the phone and the airport."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Munich,May-21,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I booked a flight from Denver to Munich with Lufthansa. I had to cancel my flights on account of covid restrictions. 6 times I attempted to call Lufthansa in order to rebook/cancel. 2 of those times I was on hold for over an hour. I only ever got through twice. 1 time when I had gotten through I was told I would be refunded, then 8 minutes later I was told I would not. I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was told I would be called by a supervisor within the next two hours. I waited 3 hours and was never called back. I still have not gotten through to anyone at the company who has been of any help."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Copenhagen via Frankfurt,May-21,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,yes,10,"  Lufthansa is an amazing airline! We wanted to visit our children in Denmark but were nervous to fly so far. Our fears were quickly dispelled with friendly flight attendants, comfy seats and really good meals. We even caught a tail wind both ways putting us an hour ahead of schedule. Totally impressed with the quality of service and smooth flight. Highly recommend!"

Rebooked my tickets for July 2021, spoke 5 times to customer services after minimum 30 mins hold each time. Wrote to Lufthansa Customer Services twice, they said I should call and be on hold again for 30 mins minimum. Called 1800 6453880, spoke with rep, she said my seats are confirmed and I will receive an email. Received the email, seats from Frankfurt to Detroit not confirmed and I cannot do it online. I paid twice for those seats and cannot get them confirmed. The service gor this company sucks. Francisco Fernandez"
✅ Trip Verified ,A319,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Belgrade via Frankfurt,Apr-21,5,5,,,,5,3,yes,10,  I always love to fly with Lufthansa and their airlines in the Lufthansa group.

Not Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Luxembourg to Zagreb via Frankfurt,May-21,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Just got my return flight canceled and the alternative provided was to fly a 9.15am to 10.30am to Frankfurt and then a flight from 9.45am to 11.00 from Frankfurt to Luxembourg. Called Customer service (Luxembourg) and did not get any viable alternative: all flights are non-existent with just a possibility to get home 4 business days later. No alternative to fly from other countries and just a ""you cancel your flight"" and not get any voucher, flights are more expensive and this is not a way to treat your customer (especially in COVID times). In short: terrible customer support, no voucher and no professional service."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Larnaca,Mar-21,,,,,,1,1,no,2,"  I never had any problem with this airline before, until yesterday when the person at the gate told to me to ""somehow verify that I am a resident of the destination"". This according to him was a law and if I could not show him that I live there he would not let me board unless I had a negative covid test. Both of these things I did not know of. I show to the staff there my plf which states that I am a resident there. I ended up losing my flight and paying 276 to rebook for the next day after a long line at the service center which was half-empty. "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Sao Paulo to Amsterdam via Frankfurt,Feb-21,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  On our return flight from Santa Cruz (Bolivia) to Sao Paulo Lufthansa ordered BOA to take us off the flight, arguing we would not be able to enter the Netherlands via Sao Paolo and Frankfurt. We were not aware this also applied to passengers in transit only. Two days before departure Lufthansa had rescheduled a part of our flight without Cheaptickets.nl informing us about the existence of a major problem. Later on the day of departure, Lufthansa registered a no show for the flight from Sao Paulo to Frankfurt. As a consequence our flight could not be rescheduled (via Buenos Aires) and we lost our tickets.  We do not expect Lufthansa to take responsibility. We filed a claim but now have to wait for two month in order to present it for arbitration."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Munich,Jan-21,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Had to rebook my flight due to Covid. Flight was booked for 2nd January 2021. Wanted to rebook for 4th January. I was told no space on this flight, and was offered a rebooking for 7th Jan - a 4-5 hour flight via Zurich or Frankfurt. Original flight was direct and 1hr 50. I was told that this was the only flight option I could rebooked on that week. This flight was no good for me, as I needed to be back Wednesday. I went online and could see it was still possible to book space for the direct flight on Monday 4th Jan. I called back and asked the customer service person how this was possible if there was no space. It was explained that Lufthansa was not letting anymore people rebook on this flight, the space left was only for new bookings. So, to get back for when I needed, I had to make a new booking on the Monday flight at a cost of EUR 138.49, because the representative refused to rebook me on this flight. This flight flew 3/4 empty. Complained to Lufthansa; told this is company policy. Only very small number of spaces for rebookings. So, they would rather let if fly 3/4 empty, than allow people to rebook."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to  Frankfurt,Mar-21,4,5,4,5,3,1,1,no,1,  I was traveling with hand luggage that I have used since 10 years without any problem. The luggage looks slightly bigger but is definitely within the hand luggage measures. Lufthansa personnel harass me in an extremely rude way what I plan to do with this luggage. He forces me to squeeze it into his hand luggage scale (which is also broken). The whole experience felt a lot like Ryanair used to be at the low point of their customer service. Even today Ryanair treats their customers better. If I want a low cost experience next time I'll fly low cost. From a national carrier with premium pricing I'd expect more.
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Fort Lauderdale to Zurich,Apr-20,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,  It has been eight months since Lufthansa cancelled my flight and promised a refund. Eight months. I have called more times than I can count. My suspicion is that they are just holding out until people give up on getting their refunds so they can keep the money. I will never fly with them again.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Frankfurt,Mar-21,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I had the worst costumer service experience with Lufthansa. They cancelled my flight 3 times so far that I can understand during the situation at the moment. But not once they notified me my flight got cancelled, I always found out by pure luck. Now they changed me to Swiss and send me confirmation email. When i ring Swiss they told me I haven’t been transferred even though Lufthansa send me an email. I ring Lufthansa again and they told me sometimes that happens. My original route was Hong Kong to Frankfurt, now changed to Hong Kong - Zurich - Frankfurt. Since I travelled with my dog and I can’t take my dog on the plane for the second leg (Zurich - Frankfurt) I asked if I can just fly to Zurich and take a car for the rest of my journey. They said ok but I have to pay an extra 600HKD. Its the same flight, if anything it should be cheaper because I don’t fly the second leg but they still charge me. They cancelled my direct flight in the first place."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Mumbai to Frankfurt,Feb-21,3,5,5,4,4,5,5,yes,8,"  Bombay to Frankfurt in Business Class. Even with the smaller aircraft (A330) that Lufthansa has now deployed on this route during the pandemic, they have a hard time filling the aircraft. The Business Class cabin had a total of 7 passengers including us. The check-in process at BOM was quick. Lufthansa has stopped offering the GVK Lounge for premium passengers. Even in Frankfurt some Business Lounges are closed. We got access to the Senator Lounge. Even there, no food or drink service was offered, only some packaged items. Clearly Lufthansa is cutting its losses, trying hard to make up for lost passenger revenue. The flight itself was pleasant. Lufthansa's on-board service remains top notch. Now if only it could upgrade its dated Business Class seats."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Keflavik,Feb-21,3,5,4,,,5,5,yes,8,"  Frankfurt to Keflavík, Iceland, in Business Class. Business Class within Europe on most airlines is a sad product. The seats are identical to those in Economy with the allowance that the middle seat remains unoccupied. The best aspect of traveling Lufthansa is that you are likely to have a predictable travel experience: flights leave on time and onboard service is competent. With those expectations, we were not disappointed. It is time for Lufthansa to equip its A320neo fleet with WiFi."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Warsaw,Feb-21,4,1,1,1,3,1,3,no,1,"  I have flown with Lufthansa today and my flight was at 21:20. We have got on the plane at about 21:45. We have then waited almost 1.5 hours for the plane to even move from its spot. We had very little update whatsoever. We were supposed to arrive at 22:50, instead, we arrived at 01:00. We now also have to wait 30 minutes for the baggages. This is terrible. The staff was useless.  This feels like we deserve a refund for at least 40%. Not satisfied at all."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Helsinki to Brussels via Frankfurt,Dec-20,3,2,2,,,1,1,no,1,"  I had a flight Helsinki to brussels via Frankfurt. On arrival to Frankfurt, I couldn't my flight from Frankfurt to brussels. I went to check this with customer service and was told there is no such flight. I was shocked about this given that my travel dates had be changed earlier by them. The woman at customer service desk was super rude. She told me that there was no such flight scheduled for Brussels at 12.00 and if there was earlier on the flight was cancelled (12.00) and that the next one was due at 21.00 and there was nothing she could do. She also told me that is is not Lufthansa's fault that the flight was cancelled and that I should have been informed about the cancellation by booking.com from where I had booked this flight. This when the exchange between us got heated and and there was raising of voices despite the fact that there were other customers in the queue. Eventually she told me that there is nothing she can do and waved me off. This really shocked me because I am sure booking.com cannot cancel the airline's flights and the responsibility of getting me to my destination is on Lufthansa. But more surprisingly, is the fact that they never bothered to contact me about this. I had to travel to my destination by train hoping to be compensated for this inconvenience. On my return to Helsinki, both flights were late again. Upon arriving in Helsinki at midnight, my suitcases went missing. Again there is no traffic during corona time so I did not understand this. Helsinki airport was a graveyard, there was no one to ask. So for one hour I just walked around the airport looking for help which I finally got and I finally filled the form. Since I arrived late in Helsinki, I had to get a hotel room and pay for taxi as there was no direct bus to Turku at that hour. The next day I spent money buying essential warm clothes. I obviously a claim form and sent an email to Lufthansa requesting for compensation for the inconveniences: canceled flight and the cost incurred during the period (6 days) my luggage was missing. When they finally got back to me, I was shocked when they said that it is not their responsibility that Lufthansa canceled my flight and therefore they will not compensate me for the train ticket. They never apologised for the late flights and time spent looking for my luggage that led to me missing the last bus to Turku. In total I had spent 315.95 euros during this period, however, they refused to compensate me the full amount and only decided on 123 euros. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,First Class,Sao Paulo to Athens via Frankfurt,Jan-21,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,yes,10,"  From the time I got into the plane to the time I got out, it was a truly first class flight. No service cuts because of the pandemic, dinner and breakfast were phenomenal. But what made this flight unforgettable was the crew. Highly professional, very friendly and provided an excellent service, a truly first class service. I had an excellent flight also in business class on the FRA-ATH sector. All in all, an excellent experience with Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Keflavik to Frankfurt,Jan-21,3,5,4,,,4,4,yes,7," Keflavik, Iceland to Frankfurt in Business Class in January 2021. Business Class within Europe is less than satisfying. The seating is typically the same as in Economy with the middle seat left vacant. You get a little more privacy and a meal for the extra money spent. Lufthansa's A320neo aircraft are not even equipped with wifi. Flying with a mask on, with no wifi, for 3 hours is not fun."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Cancun to Budapest,Jan-21,2,3,2,2,,1,1,no,2, We were not allowed in to the Business lounge in Cancun with our Lufthansa business ticket. I am deeply disappointed in Lufthansa Customer Service. We were travelling with Business Class tickets from Cancun to Budapest. In Cancun we could not enter the business lounge with our business ticket as Lufthansa has no contract with Cancun airport. I have sent an email to Lufthansa Customer Service about it. They answered to me that is my responsibility to check if I can enter to business lounge with my business ticket. It is not their job. I paid a lot of money and they do not care at all. No Lufthansa in the future! Compared to other airlines their business service on the airplane is poor. This is not a German attitude anymore!
✅ Trip Verified ,A330-300,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Mumbai,Jan-21,4,5,5,4,3,4,4,yes,8," FRA to BOM in Business Class in an aging A330-300. Lufthansa has replaced their 747s on the route with the smaller A330 aircraft. Flying during the current pandemic is a mixed bag - on the one hand wearing a mask all through a long haul flight is no fun, on the other hand the airports and aircraft are virtually empty making this aspect of travel far more pleasant than in normal times. As is well known, Lufthansa's long haul Business Class seat is way behind the curve. Making up somewhat for that deficiency is Lufthansa's superb inflight service. All in all, it was a very comfortable flight."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gdansk to Riyadh via Frankfurt,Jan-21,4,4,,,,4,5,yes,9,"  I would like to thank Lufthansa call centre staff for their support despite many difficulties and my abysmal German. Even though I booked a flight with an unsupported connection through agents website, when my flight was cancelled due to snow, they allowed for it to be rebooked and add additional journey leg to it without charging the price of a whole new ticket. Thank you. Flight itself was also managed very well with boarding and alighting procedures managed very well and passenger behaviour well controlled. I never eat, drink or use entertainment on flights, so I didn't rate this option."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to San Francisco,Jan-21,,,,,,1,1,no,1,  After 5 long phone calls with Lufthansa and United (who operated one part of the way) they both said they could not upgrade us and to call the other. They never said our ticket did not allow it. Then when we went to the desk before flight they said we can’t upgrade because of our ticket fare which is hilarious because we bought a round trip ticket on Lufthansa.com and on the way there we upgraded  easily. On the previous flight there were no precautions being taken. Some without masks most of the time and the flights are packed. I will never fly with Lufthansa again.
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Lagos to Toronto via Frankfurt,Dec-20,2,3,2,,,1,1,no,4,  I had extra baggage which I could not pay for online. The staff is over zealous about every item and weight check and the amount to pay is outrageous. I spent about 5hrs to check in. The trip from Canada to Nigeria at the Frankfurt to Lagos flight was very uncomfortable. The flight was full and the trip is so unbearable.
✅ Trip Verified ,A321neo,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Paris,Jan-21,3,3,2,,2,2,1,no,1," Flight more than 45 minutes late. The layover in Frankfurt was already very long (more than 4 hours), and there were no amenities or services on offer for connecting passengers. This is the 8th time I have flown with Lufthansa over the past year. The flights have never gone without problems. They have lost checked bags, cancelled flights, and not one flight has left on time. Today, the flight crew was unable to get to the airplane on time, which led to a significant delay. Very unpleasant, especially after a long day of flying. Things need to change quick."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321neo,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Frankfurt,Dec-20,4,3,2,,,3,2,no,2,  Terrible experience. Passengers are allowed to board without masks. Unacceptable in Covid times and on a completely full flight. Flight late (as always) because we had to wait for a single passenger unable to get there on time. No consideration for connecting passengers.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Porto,Dec-20,4,4,,,,1,1,no,1,"  The lane for self luggage drop off stop working on the airport. My suitcase and also suitcases from other people stayed on the line. Unfortunately nobody who could help! The lady working there sent us on “check in” for people with mobility problems. Waiting more than one hour thirty with luggage tag already pasted on it. Desperate to miss my flight, went to information center when the “very polite” woman told me first that she can’t do anything with my suitcase, that in time of Christmas are new rules: person needs to be 3 hours before the flight on airport (COVID-19 doesn’t matter) and she is the person that will rebook my flight when I miss it.  And in her opinion was also ok to pass the check in lane and beg women on check in to take me in front even though more people were in my situation. Of course was my fault that I was on airport only 2 hours before, that machine stopped working and that they don’t have enough people working. I think that Lufthansa (considered being a little bit better company) should be ashamed of their costumer service on airport. Especially in a city as Munich that they have incredible number of flights. Better not find solution and make people desperate. They will rebook your flight!!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Athens,Oct-20,5,5,5,,,2,3,yes,8," Flying Frankfurt-Athens return in October 2020 during Covid-19. I booked this flight with bonus miles as regular prices were high a few days before flight. Boarding in Frankfurt was super chaotic (typically LH) and massively delayed because gate agents checked the Greek PLF form before boarding which took ages. Boarding in Athens was in groups, but passengers shared the same bus after boarding. That doesn’t make sense. Flights were fully booked, FA's checked that passengers were wearing face masks. I had a feeling of safety during my journey. During the flight LH offered a sandwich and full bar service for free, but this era will end in 2021. Overall a good experience in these extraordinary times."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Malé,Nov-20,4,3,3,3,4,2,3,no,5,"  Smooth Check In. No Food and Drinks in the Lounge due to Corona Restrictions. Document Check and Boarding at the Gate Chaotic. Plane was fully booked and only 2 Agents. No separation between Eco and Business Class. On Board no Welcome Drink. Young and friendly female flight attendant, typical frozen Lufthansa style. After Departure one round of drinks, very cheap Champagne. Dinner with separate Appetizer and Main Course. First Choice of Food not available. No proactive offer of drinks, had to ask for. 1.5 hour before Landing very good breakfast, but again we had to ask for additional coffee for the breakfast. The flight was not bad at all, but the Business Experience is limited due to Corona. Service offers have been very cut back. But Drink and Food choice have nothing to do with corona limitations."
Not Verified ,A330,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Male to Frankfurt,Dec-20,1,4,2,3,4,1,2,no,3,"  Male is a chaotic airport which is much too small for all the traffic and passengers. Boarding around 30 minutes delayed, in small groups and by bus. First row of Premium Economy, very good leg room at bulkhead. Older, experienced female flight attendant. No Welcome Drink, no amenity kits. Pillow on the seat. After departure one round of drinks are served together with the lunch (Chicken, one bread, Mini salad, and Mini Cake) which is more or less a joke for premium economy. No more drinks, no Spirits, no Digestive. After I asked the very friendly FA brought us one Glass of Cognac from the Business Class, it felt like she was ashamed of the Lufthansa Service shortcuts. After 5 hours one cookie and another drink round, 2 hours before arrival a very small low quality dinner, a vegetable Lasagne and one small bread. The Premium Economy Seat is really uncomfortable for such a long flight. Not worth paying the money for Lufthansa Premium Economy, the most uncomfortable seat I have had in a long time."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Cairo,Dec-20,4,4,3,1,,2,1,no,2,"  Over $3,000 saved over 2 years for this 14 day trip to Egypt. I had planned and packed carefully knowing I’m a woman going to a conservative, patriarchal country. Doesn’t matter, Lufthansa left our luggage in Frankfurt. I didn’t think too much of it to begin with because half of the time I travel international they lose my luggage. But normally they get it to us the following day or the day after at the latest. If we didn’t have 5 multilingual, wonderfully kind guides from our tour company constantly harassing Lufthansa and the airport carriers, I don’t think we’d ever see our luggage again. At first they told us to come in 2 days later before we flew from Cairo to Aswan and they’d have it for us to take with us (since they have the same flight coming in every day). It never was put on the plane. Then they tell us it will be sent to us in Aswan. We’re there for 2-3 days so they have time to get it to us before we get on our Nile Cruise. They never tried to send it to Aswan. Now we just heard we won’t get our luggage until we go back to the Cairo airport and retrieve it in person. Why? Because they honestly don’t care. They don’t think it’s their problem that we don’t have our luggage. Reminder that we’re not just in a foreign country, but in Egypt. We have a body guard assigned to us from the Egyptian government to escort us whenever we leave our hotels. “Go buy some essentials and we’ll refund you 50% of the cost.” First off, even refunding me 100% of the cost is not enough to even begin to cover this inconvenience. There’s clothes, snacks, and other items in my luggage that I bought specifically for this trip that I’ve now bought in vain because I will never use them.  I saved up money, which is precious right now during the pandemic, to come here and enjoy myself! If my luggage was delivered to me in a timely fashion, I wouldn’t have been able to relax and enjoy myself rather than almost have a breakdown.  I’ve gone through experiences while traveling that have been less than ideal to say the least. I can honestly say this is the first time I’ve ever experienced an airline that is this incompetent. I will never fly Lufthansa again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Heraklion to Brussels via Athens and Münich,Dec-20,4,5,3,,,4,1,no,1,"  We booked a return flight with Lufthansa assuming that if something would go wrong in these Corona days it would get solved. What a mistake ! Our return flight from Crete to Brussels on the 19th November was cancelled and the proposal we received by e-mail was a flight from Athens to Brussels. When I called their customer support the first proposal was a flight on November 30 (11 days later) leaving 6:55 in the morning and arriving 20:50 in the evening. There were flights available leaving 6:55 arriving 10:50 several times a week but we could not be booked on those because we did not have the right booking class. I was asked to call again later, maybe other options would become available. The next time I called the proposal was even better: we would leave on the 29th and arrive on the 30th (a stay in a hotel was not included). I could contact customer relations if I did not like this, which I did. The only answer I got from them was that their customer services were able to handle this problem. After calling 5 or 6 times they finally arranged a flight for us: on the 1st December. At least that was what I understood because when I received the e-mail it said the 5th. When I tried to get this changed I was told that I would have to pay because I confirmed their alternative. When they were calculating the cost they ended the call so I gave up and booked a flight with another airline and got home without problems. Off course I did not want to throw away the money I spent on the Lufthansa ticket so I tried to rebook it for next year. Again a huge mistake. If the flight was booked as a return flight on their website it would cost only €8 more than my original ticket, but as a single ticket it would cost € 150 more. So changing the ticket to next year would cost me €150 per person."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to Copenhagen,Nov-20,2,1,2,1,1,2,1,no,1,"  I booked my return tickets and few days after I wanted to add my luggage. I could not add it online since they do not have the possibility on their website (in my opinion not very up-to-date for an airline), so I called and did the purchase of baggage over the phone. My surprise came when on both flights (inbound and outbound) I had to pay the full airport fee for extra baggage over the check-in desk. Seems they had an error in their system and that the transactions did not go through and they did not inform me. The personnel at the airport asked me to claim for a refund on the difference between the online and the airport fees, so I did. After I explained my case, Lufthansa recognized that it was their fault but they would not give me my money back. I insisted to talk to a supervisor and I was denied to do so. I booked Lufthansa thinking that if I had any problem during Covid times I would not have to worry about claiming money, but seems that they are as any other low-cost carrier. You better fly with the real low-cost than Lufthansa, at least your flight tickets will be cheaper."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Cologne via Frankfurt,Jul-20,,,,,,,1,no,2,"  This is the worst airline experience I have ever had. I got a ticket from Singapore to Germany for September 2020 which was postponed due to COVID which I completely understand then the airline cancels my ticket and never bothered to refund until now (December 2020). Every time I need to call their call centre and check on status and all thy respond is ""it will take another 2 weeks and you don't have to call, we will process your refund"" but it has taken forever. They never bother to notify if they do not process before the committed timeline and when I call back they say it will take another 10 days and this is endless... the call centre team is the worst, they cannot direct me to the refund team as it is internal and they cannot give answers on the timelines because it is managed by the refund team!

✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Nice,Jul-20,4,2,1,,,3,3,no,2," Companies chose different strategies for handling the corona crisis, but Lufthansa chose the worst possible one. By the end of the June the carrier cancelled more than half of the summer flights without letting the passengers know. The only option for arranging rerouting or obtaining refund was through call centers, which took hours to reach. Unbelievable. When checking in, the ground staff wanted me to pay for checked baggage, which I had already prepaid online. Hadn't I printed the receipt and had it with me at the airport to prove it, I would have lost 50€. I didn't enjoy the flight itself either, as the refreshments on board were cancelled without previous notice, only water was available. Overall the worst experience with an airline I've ever had."
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Lagos,Nov-20,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,  They cancelled my flight without any notification. I was stranded and had to book a last minute flight with another airline. I called their customer service and they didn’t even apologize for the inconvenience.

✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Business,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Athens via Munich,Sep-20,5,4,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I checked in with a suitcase at Los Angeles International Airport to go to Athens in Greece through Munich. I was assigned a seat number and given boarding cards for the 1st flight LH0453 (LAX to MUC) as well as for the 2nd flight LH1754 (MUC to ATH). I was told my suitcase will go straight to Athens and arriving in Munich I had only to go to the gate and with the given boarding card to get the plane to Athens. The flight LH0453 arrived in Munich about 3 hours before the 2nd flight. In about 30 minutes I was in front of the gate for my 2nd flight to Athens. To my surprise, 20 minutes before the departure, the Lufthansa person stopped me and did not allow me to get to the plane. I was told that I needed to have the PLF form from the Greek authorities. At the check-in in LAX nobody told me anything neither before when a few days earlier I had called Luftansa. Instead, they had assured me beeing a US and Greek citizen I did not need anything else. This time, 20 minutes before the departure of my flight to Athens, I was not allowed to enter the plane and I had to stay in Munich until I fill the PLF form. Although they had given me boarding card in LAX, they forced me to stay in Munich airport without any assistance  and they refused to put me in a new flight the next day with the excuse that my ticket was a United Airline ticket and not Lufthansa. This is the worst experience I have come across. The Lufthansa people in Munich did everything not to give me any assistance and to ignore me. They did not want to help me finding a hotel around the airport nor another flight next day, they did not even want to give me my suitcase that was already on the plane to Athens. "

CSR said it'll be refunded in 2 weeks. April - October 2020: Called 3 additional times during this period to request a refund. CSR said it'll be refunded in 2 weeks, every single time we called. We waited over an hour each time. I gave them the benefit of the doubt each time because of the circumstances. November 2020: Finally received a refund after 8 months. I understand the situation we are in with the pandemic. I don't care about the long call times as that was to be expected, but stop lying to everyone. Stop saying it will take 2 weeks when that just isn't true. I was going to submit a chargeback December 1, 2020 if I did not receive my refund by then. It took over 8 months, 4 calls, and a bunch of lies by CSR to receive my refund. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Copenhagen,Sep-20,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I called to change my flight from Oslo to Stockholm after learning of new COVID restrictions in Norway. The representative told me the total of the change charges and then I was actually charged double. I called and wrote emails to dispute the double charge and they refused to look into it any further. They told me that my receipt showed the double charge and that was correct, despite me only agreeing to being charged what I was told on the phone which was half the amount I was actually charged. Second, my flight from MUC to BOI was cancelled and they didn't bother to notify me. It took months and hours on the phone with them to get a refund for the flight. I was flying with my dog and called to add her to my booking and was told the charge for her based on size and weight would be 200 USD. When I got to the airport to check her in, I was told the charge would be 440 USD. There was nothing I could do at that point but pay the higher fee. I was willing to be patient due to the COVID situation and high volumes of calls coming in, but we are 8 months in to the pandemic and a major airline like Lufthansa has had time to adjust to the environment."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Vilnius to Dallas,Jun-20,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1," Lufthansa canceled my niece's flight due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I followed all the instructions to apply for a refund. I spoke with customer service 6 times during 4 months period. Every time the representative would ensure me that the money will be in my account within two weeks. And yet, after almost 5 months - still no money! Last time I spoke to a customer representative, she gave me a bogus number to call to get me off the phone. I spoke to supervisors, I wrote to their review section. No result! Lufthansa is holding over $2,000 without any interest and no plan to return it."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Basel to Rio de Janeiro via Frankfurt,Jul-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  This company is the worst ever ! I booked a ticket in February for a departure in August. Of course due to covid, they canceled the flight. Since then I'm fighting to get my refund. I would never fly with them again. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Nairobi,Sep-20,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Had all the correct documentation for entry at destination, but denied boarding. Can appreciate staff were being cautious, but caused major hassles and expenses due to missing connecting flights. Wrote to airline, but they continue to deny any wrongdoing. Poor customer service.  Why book with an airline that you don't know if they'll even let you on despite having the correct documentation? "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bangalore to Houston via Frankfurt,Sep-20,5,5,5,5,,5,5,yes,10,"  We travelled to USA from India in September 2020. After booking our International flight, including a pet dog, our party consisting of my 16 yr Son, 13 yr Daughter, 1 yr Shihtzu pet, and me, arrived into Frankfurt Airport. The connecting Airline (United) informed us that we will not be able to take our pet inflight, and would have to make arrangements such as flying her as cargo (which, being a flat nosed dog, would be a risk), or re book ourselves with Lufthansa, as it was their booking. I told my kids not to be worried or afraid. To keep the focus on the goal - which was, all of us reaching safely, home to TX, to be with my Husband. Well, we watched United Flight take off, sat down for a family talk as to the next steps. We had our tickets, pet passport, a credit card, free Wifi, our Optimism and willingness to adjust. The Lufthansa service counter Staff were awesome! They listened to our story in detail. After a conference with their Manager, we were informed that they could put us all in their flight the following morning. So, we customized our sleepover at the airport. Their reclining chairs to sleep, sandwiches carried in our bags for dinner, showers the next morning at the Airport transit hotel with great free coffee & hot chocolate. At our departure time, Lufthansa upgraded us from economy to Premium economy, giving us that much needed comfort in space. Truly grateful for the airline staff's empathy, their attitude and the human connect."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bucharest to Frankfurt,Jul-20,2,3,1,1,1,1,1,no,1,"  Very disappointed with all the services starting with boarding and finishing with the customer service. They do not assume any responsibility for the incompetence of their staff, in order to verify and apply the airline regulations. This is very disappointing that a company like Lufthansa tries to blame the passengers and they don't look internally to seek if there is a problem related to the training of the employees. I would never recommend this airline and I am not travelling anymore with them."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Shanghai ,Oct-20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,2," I booked a ticket with Lufthansa from London Heathrow (LHR) to Shanghai (PVG) on the 27th of October 2020. Later, Lufthansa infomed me the flight was cancelled. Lufthansa rebooked me to a Swiss Air flight on the 25th October from LHR to PVG. I also received the confirmation email from Lufthansa about my rebooking and it said my flight was confirmed. Today, I rang Lufthansa and the customer services told me my ticket with Swiss Air was not issued so I cannot take the flight on 25th October, the one I thought I was going to take. Then I rang Swiss Air and they told me my reservation is in their system but the ticket is still the old Lufthansa ticket for 27th October, so they cannot issue me a new ticket on the 25th flight. Meanwhile, I was told there was no Economy seat but Business and First on the 25th Swiss Air flight. But on the 1st of October, when the rebooking was incurred, there are plenty of economy seats on that flight. Besides, there are other flight options in October. Now, I was told there are no available flights in October. I'm so upset and disappointed with Lufthansa, this has totally disrupted and ruined my plans and it will cost me significantly. I have urgent business matters and I need to be in Shanghai on time. If Lufthansa did not provide me the false information and told me right at the beginning (on the 1st October) that the rebooking is not successful then I would still have other options. But today is the 6th October and there are no other flights! I called your customer services multiple times and they couldn't help me at all but just asked me to wait! This is truly absurd! "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,First Class,Frankfurt to Johannesburg,Oct-20,4,5,,,,4,4,yes,10,"  Can't fault their customer service. My wife's original flight was cancelled, I called them up and had it rebooked in under 3 minutes and got the date she wanted. No hassle. Happy customer!"
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cape Town to Malaga via Frankfurt,Oct-20,1,1,,,,1,3,no,2,  I haven't flown yet but am appalled by the attitude of this airline. On 23.09.2020 my husband and I booked to fly Cape Town to Malaga via Frankfurt on 27-28/10/2020. This included paying for pre-booked seats on both legs. On 30/09/2020 we were rebooked by the airline with a two night layover in Frankfurt. No mention of a hotel being provided as per IATA regulations. Today I called customer service in Johannesburg as there is a flight on 29/10/2020 which connects with the second leg and this was rapidly processed with no mention by the seats. The confirmatory email arrived with no seat allocation and mention of our not having seating included. I called up customer services again and was told there was a R2 difference in price per seat so they could refund the entire cost of the tickets (read as wait many months to get our money back) and rebook and pay again. Please note the exchange rate of R19.34 to the euro. The call was cut off while I was still hanging on. No Lufthansa - even in these bad times they are other airlines available.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Milan linate to Stockholm Arlanda,Mar-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I am waiting for a 149,40€ refund from Lufthansa since end of March, when my flights were cancelled due to COVID. I have been contacting their extremely ineffective customer service for 6 months without receiving any decent feedback. I called them, emailed them, I have been called from them, at least 30 times in total. Always without results. I even got my money back from Ryanair, EasyJet and other low-cost airline companies, for flights that have been cancelled due to COVID. Lufthansa is the only airline company from which I am still waiting my money back. I used to think that Lufthansa was a serious company. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320/B777,Business,Business Class,Marseille to Tokyo via Frankfurt,Jul-20,,,,,,,1,no,5,"  I recently posted a review complaining that LH was not refunding my Business Class ticket to Japan, after having cancelled some of the included flights. 3 months later I am now pleased to receive a letter in German with a full refund value, immediately credited to my Credit Card. Note that it might be the result of a formal file that I sent which was moving to mediation with LH in Germany on this specific refunding vs voucher topic."
✅ Trip Verified ,a320A,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Brussels,Sep-20,4,5,3,,,4,4,yes,8,"  This is rather short flight - boarding and departure was on time people at the boarding desk were courteous. A small but decent meal was offered together with a choice of beverages. Lufthansa should learn to provide plain bread instead of bread with seeds. FA were very friendly. Arrival was on time : unfortunately at the airport there was a delay in delivering the luggage. Caused by a bankruptcy, Lufthansa had to take another company for ground handling - 40 minutes waiting time and despite decently labelled as priority, suitcase did arrive as one of the last ones."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Marseilles to Tokyo via Frankfurt,Jul-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  We had a trip to Japan booked from France (Marseille to Tokyo). My Japanese partner booked on ANA website and I did on LH website, the exact same flights (code-shared), on business class, each flight worth more than 2500 Euros. Lufthansa cancels the first leg of the journey, re-issued a ticket without our agreement, from Frankfurt, and changed the rest of the flight. ANA immediately notified my Japanese partner, who was fully refunded in less than 30 days. I requested a refund to LH. So far more, then 2 months later I have just received an email acknowledging my request. All other contacts were not responded. Note that I am a Star Alliance Gold pax (no use). On the other hand LH is still sending me commercial advertisement, for paying tickets to Asia, business class of course. An insult to my intelligence, as nearly all Asian countries do not allow Europeans.  With such a behavior, how can an ex-Premium airline like LH believe that we will ever fly again with them?"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Tirana to Frankfurt,Mar-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Tirana to Frankfurt booked on non refundable tickets. Very bad customer service, we contacted many times that because of the cancellation of the Fair in Frankfurt we would not be able to go and 2 days after our flight other flights was cancelled. If we would have used the ticked we would have been stuck in Frankfurt and they didn't refund us anything, even though it was not our fault that everything was canceled we took 100% penalty. Worst customer service."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Birmingham to Frankfurt,Sep-20,4,4,4,,,1,4,yes,5,"  The Aspire lounge at Birmingham was open for business but Lufthansa no longer give access to business class passengers or status Miles & More members. Can be for no other reason but to cut costs and I was flying on a paid for business class ticket. Not acceptable. And for the first time (having flown this route countless times over the years) no airbridge - again, is this cost cutting? There were plenty of gates with bridges available."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to Helsinki via Frankfurt,Aug-20,1,1,1,,,2,1,no,1,"  I used to choose Lufthansa because of the good service and reliability of their schedules. I am a regular customer on this route and I didn’t care to pay their more expensive flight ticket. However, Lufthansa practices are now like low cost airlines. They let you book a flight ticket for a very expensive price at the best schedule for you. Then, less than one week before of the flight date, they cancel your booking and put you in the flight that costed the least. I arrive to my  destination at 1am in the morning without the possibility to take any public transportation. So end up paying for the most expensive flight, original train tickets and the new train tickets. Apart from that, they use to serve some drinks and snacks. In the last year with the strikes and the Coronavirus excuses they  offer a bottle of water. Have they reduced they ticket price? Not at all. If you need to fly to Helsinki, use Finnair. More expensive? Yes. But they take responsibility for their actions."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Chicago,Jul-20,4,2,1,2,3,3,1,no,2,"  I traveled from Frankfurt to Chicago. In spite of being the only passenger the service was very poor. The flight attendant disappeared fast. Food was very poor and limited, more like Economy. There were no sanitizers in the bathroom.  My bags were last to arrive in O'Hare. "
✅ Trip Verified ,CRJ9,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Manchester,Aug-20,3,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  Munich to Manchester on an EcoLight ticket. In the current world of COVID-19, i truly believe Lufthansa were a huge let down. Munich Airport is perfectly acceptable with all the safety measures in place until time to board the flight. I understand as the plane was small and unable to connect to a jet bridge, but to pack customers on to a bus with no social distancing possible was unreal, yes people are wearing masks but that's not enough. The bus was full of stickers asking you to keep 1.5m apart which was not possible as they seem to get the whole plane on one bus. The service was extremely poor only a warm bottle of water was provided but a dining service for Business Class. "
✅ Trip Verified ,CRJ-900LR,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bucharest to Munich,Aug-20,2,3,2,,,1,1,no,1,"  Prior to my Lufthansa flight I wanted to use the lounge at Bucharest Airport. The Lounge is open and when booking the ticket couple of days ago on the Lufthansa website there was an advertisement, that lounge use is included in my business class ticket. In front of the lounge at Bucharest is a sign that Lufthansa cancelled contract lounge access.  The service agent at the lounge confirmed that with Lufthansa access to the lounge is not possible but I can buy access for a fee. It is not fair of Lufthansa to advertise lounge access but then this is not delivered. There is no indication on the Lufthansa website. Even when calling the Lufthansa service hotline they do not know. But there are numerous reports about frustrated travellers that Lufthansa has cancelled lounge access some weeks ago even when the lounge is open. The flight itself was okay. I find it not okay that we had to take a bus at Munich airport to get to the terminal."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Malta to Frankfurt,Jan-20,,,,,,,1,no,3,  I was scheduled to fly with Lufthansa in July 2020. They cancelled my flight and had no other alternative to offer. I have been waiting for my refund for 45 days which was promised to me after 20 days. All I get are promises. Their email requests our support. 
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Beirut via Frankfurt,May-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Paris to Beirut via Frankfurt, I was supposed to fly 18th May. Ticket had been cancelled in May 2. After 3 months neither contact from the airline nor refund received. I called them many times and was not able to obtain any information. In the end I  got a voucher limited to 12-2020, to be booked before 31-08-2020"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Gdańsk to Lisbon via Frankfurt,Mar-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,  I was supposed to fly from Gdańsk to Lisbon 18th April.

✅ Trip Verified ,E190/A319-100,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gdańsk to Nuremberg via Frankfurt,Aug-20,3,1,1,,,3,4,no,5,"  I travelled from Gdańsk to Nuernberg via FRA. The domestic legs were operated by Lufthansa Express Rail. The flights were performed quite seamless, after check-in issues had been resolved - unable to check-in online although call-center assured everything is correct. The service was poor - single bottle of water was distributed. The airline justifies this as covid 19 precaution, and no inflight magazines as well. The cabin crew average. I like the combinations of plane and train, but the layover length was too long - there were trains prior to mine."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tbilisi to Mexico City via Munich / Frankfurt,Aug-20,3,1,2,3,,1,2,no,4,"  Tbilisi to Mexico City via Munich / Frankfurt. All deficiencies in service seem to blamed on covid. Some crew were great but a few were nasty, seemed unhappy with the job. This is not the Lufthansa of a few years ago. I had to pay for extra baggage which is 3 days late in arriving. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bodrum to Munich,Aug-20,1,1,2,,,1,1,no,1,"  As tourists from the USA, my partner and I were flying with Lufthansa in Business Class. Even though the Bodrum Airport lounge was open, we were informed that Lufthansa has cancelled contracts with some lounges. Therefore, we could not enter the lounge at our departure airport. European business class is a regular class seat with the middle seat kept free. No onboard entertainment was offered. Flight time was 2.5 hours so I expected a little bit more than just one tray of food. No champagne was offered before the flight. "
Not Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Vienna to Chicago,Mar-20,,,,,,,2,no,3," Typical Covid-19 experience: Flight canceled by Lufthansa in March, difficult to reach customer services, very long wait on refund (19 weeks). I haven't given them the lowest score, because at the end of the day I did receive a full refund without needing to argue. Long wait, difficulties reaching customer services and their inability to provide concrete information on how the process will commence and thorough disappointment at how they treat longstanding customers with disinterest, were my reasons for withholding more stars."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Helsinki to Munich,Aug-20,5,5,5,,,5,5,yes,10,"  Flight was on time and arrived 20 min. ahead of schedule. Although airport services in HEL are still quite limited (no lounge, very few shops and restaurants open), check-in and boarding were smooth and hassle-free. Inflight crew was outstanding. Very personal service and unlike other carriers, LH offers the full range of inflight service. Very tasty hot meal and full selection of drinks. Cabin was spotlessly clean and space in C-Class was sufficient. In addition to that everyone is handed-out disinfection wipes upon boarding. Clear announcements from the flight deck regarding routing and de-boarding procedures. Upon arrival de-boarding was very well organized and the luggage came within minutes. Kudos to the insight crew, which did a brilliant job!"
Not Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Denver to Hamburg,May-20,,,,,,,1,no,1," Our flight was scheduled for May 28th, but canceled due to the corona virus a couple of day before. Since than we try to get our money back but waiting still for a refund. Lufthansa don't answer emails and you cant get them on the phone because of the high volume of customer contacting them they say. It is now more than 8 weeks and we are still waiting for the refund for more than $5k. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Hamburg to Chisinau via Frankfurt,Apr-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Due to the coronavirus Lufthansa cancelled the round trip flights, which is understandable, but did not refund a total of 235.65 EUROS and made it impossible to do it. Online refund is not available on their website, because I didn't pay extra to cancel it by myself and get the refund, thus redirecting me to the number listed for each country you are in, the number of the country I live in (Moldova) is inexistent, tried dialing it in many ways, whenever I was writing an email to them explaining the issue with the number, they just told me to dial it again because they don't do refunds via emails, and they didn't even respond to my last two emails. "
✅ Trip Verified ,CRJ9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Münich to Bremen,Jul-20,1,1,1,,,1,3,no,2,"  Most lounges closed or very limited service. No masks or hand disinfection before flight or at boarding. Only disinfection tissue in the airplane, which ever guest takes from the same bowl. So best way to get really in touch which every guest on board. Onboard very limited service, only a bottle of water on 70 mins flight. My seat in CRJ9 very uncomfortable, small and tight. "
✅ Trip Verified ,CRJ900 / A319,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Lyon ,Jul-20,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  After paying for selected seats I saw the seat numbers had changed, one from row 6 was now row 23. Only after numerous attempts did I get through to Lufthansa only to be cut off in the middle of my call. I tried to call 4 or 5 more times to simply be cut off before anyone answered the call. I then tried using the Miles and More member number, I got through after just a few minutes and was helped by a courteous friendly assistant who, after 5 minutes, re-allocated the original seats. At no time did Lufthansa inform me of this change or of the fact they had seated two people on the same booking some 15 rows apart. I wrote an email to Lufthansa on 29.06 asking for an explanation on 23.07 received an automated replay that did not address my question. The seat numbers continued to change in the days leading up to the flight at least the changes were in the same area. 48 hours before the flight the screen showed that the seats ""could not be pre-booked on this leg of the journey¨ but could be selected at time of check-in? In line with an apparent Lufhansa ""Covid19 code of conduct"" during this whole seat reservation farce the seat next to a booked seat was shown as ""non-bookable"" .. an intelligent and logical move, a positive Lufthansa initiative. However on boarding the plane (after ground staff informing us the pre-booked boarding assistance was ready! I had no requested this and after a brief discussion the whole thing was dismissed with indifference and lack to interest on their part. Upon boarding to my surprise people I saw that in fact passengers were sitting in the ""non-bookable seats"" .. no Covid19 distancing as implied by Lufthansa. In addition to being incompetent during the booking and boarding process they were also lying about their ""responsible seating policy"", Additionally boarding was more chaotic than normal, people queuing in the aisles, moving from the back to the front of the plane: evidence of the Lufthansa “dynamic seating process”. During the flight the FAs handed out 3 documents in a disorganized and giggly fashion, requesting us to complete them. The request was in unclear/garbled English and German. When unable to fill out 1 form (as none of the options applied to me) I asked the FA how to proceed: she replied “I don’t know, I´m just a FA, just fill in something!”  One form was handed back to the FA, the other 2 had to be handed to the French authorities at passport control/security at Lyon arrivals. There were no officials at Lyon arrivals, no passport or security controls. One document was only valid for nationals from non-EU countries (plus UK, Norway.) The FA clearly had not understood the forms she was handing out. On the return flight I received a “Boarding Gate change” on my phone, the new gate being quoted as G26. As I was unable to find any “G” gates I asked a security guard where the G area was (no ground staff were at the original boarding area). We were then called to board (at the original gate) only to be kept standing for 15 min while the confused and theatrical ground staff gave us unclear and contradictory information. We we bused to the plane (overfull bus). I saw 2 “low-cost"" airlines using airbridges. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Stockholm to Catania via Munich,Jul-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  The trip was cancelled the day before departure without any notice going out to us. I checked my spam filter, but nothing. Luckily we discovered this when trying to check in online, and an error message appeared. When calling the lady at customer services she did not at all see this as a problem, but just told us that next flight was in five days. She also offered us a refund.  When pushing her about cancellation routines (eg sending out an email) she avoided the subject. If we had not noticed this ourselves, we would have gone all the way to the airport early in the morning with two small children to discover that the vacation was cancelled on our own."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to Mexico City via Frankfurt,Jul-20,5,1,1,3,,3,4,no,7,"  Comfortable seats and nice, clean planes. Crew quite rude and once even skipped my row when giving out drinks. I paid €380 for a return flight to Mexico which is quite good but if I was to pay more, I'd rather travel with other airline. Only 1 hot meal and I literally starved for the rest of my 12 hour flight. Hot meal is just veg pasta, no selection possible. Its just an ok, no frills airline. I would never travel again with them at full price ticket, would pick KLM, air France Kalinski or BA. for €380, sure, I'd just take some food with me."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Prague to Bilbao via Frankfurt,Jun-20,4,2,1,,,2,1,no,2,"  I purchased a return flight ticket with Lufthansa on their website to fly Prague-Frankfurt-Bilbao/Bilbao-Munich-Prague. The outbound flight from Prague was great. They only gave out a bottle of water during the flight, but this is perfectly acceptable for a 50-minute flight.  Frankfurt airport is operating out of just the one terminal: Terminal 1. This means that the terminal was cram-packed full of people. There was only one restaurant open and it was expensive and the quality of the food was pretty poor.  The flight to Bilbao was approx. 2 hours, and during this flight they only gave out one bottle of water per person - all in the claim that it is because of COVID-19. The following morning, I received an email from Lufthansa - apologising that there have been changes made to my booking and asking me to either accept the new conditions, or choose not to and keep the flight open. The problem was that there was no alternative flight option shown. Lufthansa cancelled my return flight and didn't give me the option of rescheduling my return flight on 24th July. I went online and entered my booking details into their site and only my outbound flight was showing up. My ticket had been changed to a one-way ticket. I tried calling their customer service number but after multiple attempts - they just don't pick up - I gave up. I also sent them a couple of messages, using their contact form, but again, no response. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Winnipeg to Varna,May-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  We had a flight booked for May 2020 from Winnipeg to Varna, Bulgaria. Due to the coronavirus pandemic our flight could not be used. Then the problems began - Lufthansa in USA has a waiting time between 1 hour, 2 hours or never to get connected. Then, once connected they are trying to charge money for no reason - you receive same flight, now overpriced!"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Panama to Amsterdam via Frankfurt,Sep-19,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I've flown with Lufthansa multiple times for business and leisure and it has worked out perfectly fine time after time. The only difference this time is, I have to deal with their customer service, and this is where it goes down hill. In February, I booked a ticket for my girlfriend to come visit me and unfortunately, the pandemic hits. The airports get closed and the ticket flight gets cancelled. As I read (or mis-read online) there was supposed to be a button in the online environment to click to issue a re-fund and so I did. Time goes by and of course they violate their own policy of returning the refund. The real problem for me starts in their communication. I've been trying to get hold of their customer service for the past 5 months by e-mail or by phone. Their phone lines are either flat out busy or cut out after 2 hours of being on hold. I've gotten hold of their employee's once in twenty1 hour calls.  I've gotten some written feedback but basically, none of it was anything more than that they acknowledged the situation but can't provide any help. Feedback on my ticket telling me they cant respect their deadlines.Me forwarding the claim to my credit card company. Lufthansa re-reviews the ticket but tells they can't help me without any argumentation. Creditcard company tells me I need a statement that my flight got cancelled (which i didn't got), so I re-approach via a ticket. I get hold of Lufthansa once by phone and they inform me I cancelled the ticket myself  because their system processed my action as a cancellation and they mention to me they can't see the flight was actually cancelled. Spoiler alert, the airport was closed, it was. I'm advised to re-make a flight disruption ticket to explain this. Here is specifically ask for a confirmation of the flight cancellation. Not a refund but instead of sending me that, they issue me to the refund department. Here I realised they are playing a game with me, because the moment they send me the cancellation confirmation, I can get the money refunded via my credit card company. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Calgary,May-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Almost two months of cancelled flight and no refund yet, they said that time it will take 10 business days. I am shocked their helpline was awesome and now every time I call after 1-2 hour wait call drops. Pathetic service. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A321-231,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Brussels to Munich,Jul-19,5,5,3,,,5,5,yes,10,"  Brussels to Munich in July 2019 was a very professional and comfortable experience. From easy and polite check-in at Brussels to the goodbye at the cabin door upon arrival by excellent cabin crew, the service is seamless. Seating is decent for a 1 hour 4 min flight and they offer a snack Or Brunch. Lufthansa is superior to other European carriers and I would like choose Lufthansa for my next European tours. Thoroughly recommended, flight was delayed 33 minutes due to some technical problems. "
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to London ,May-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Lufthansa chose to cancel my flights and then refused to refund the money for those flights. To make it worse, they only allow contact with call centres in South Asia, manned by people who have no means of communicating with Lufthansa. So essentially Lufthansa cannot be bothered by customers asking for their money to be returned for flights Lufthansa is not flying. How do they expect to survive in the future if they treat their customers this poorly? "
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Seoul to Frankfurt,Apr-20,,,,,,1,1,no,1,  Canceled my flight on April 8th. 5 weeks later still didn’t receive my money.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Munich,Mar-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,  I was due to fly in March but Lufthansa cancelled my booking the week before and to this day I cant get my money refunded. I keep emailing customer services and getting the same generic answer back. Very bad practice and would never use this company again.
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to London,Mar-20,5,4,4,,,5,4,yes,8,"  Munich to London. Generally a very good flight with Lufthansa but nothing extraordinary. Check in at Munich airport was smooth and without any queues, however the experience at the airport was not that good later on. The staff at Lufthansa business lounge, which I had a pleasure to try, was rude, abrupt and unhelpful. The boarding process on the other hand very well organised thanks to using the group boarding procedure. The flight was ok, on time and without any issues. The refreshments (salami sandwich, apple juice and water) were good quality and fresh and the cabin crew were also nice. The pilots didn't give any information on the flight, something I always appreciate in other airlines, such as BA. The one thing that deserves the praise is the aircraft - A320neo - very clean, quiet and designed with attention to details. The legroom in row 5 was amazing."

Lufthansa cancelled my flights 2 weeks ago and said to call the call centre for rebooking options, tried calling them for weeks no one picked the phone and so I clicked refund online and sent an email to their customer service team, they sent me a reply saying everything is normal and since I clicked refund, I don't qualify for a refund or rebooking when my flight is due in 5 days. It clearly even now shows that the flight is cancelled by Lufthansa on my bookings. I spent hours calling their customer service today again when they provided a different contact no, the 1st representative hung up on me and the 2nd simply put me on mute and waited for me to hang up saying that the flight will be refunded and an email would be sent confirming."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Malta to Frankfurt,Mar-20,,,,,,,1,no,1,  Malta to Frankfurt. I called Lufthansa Malta customer care 8 times and no one wants to take the phone call. The generic Lufthansa email is not accepting any more emails. A process where the company decides to cancel the booking then I believe that an email informing about a refund is received rather than trying to call them myself multiple times and no email contact.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to Budapest via Frankfurt,Aug-19,,,,,,1,1,no,2,"  Our family was supposed to fly from Toronto to Budapest via Frankfurt with a dog in hold on March 20th,2020. While we were driving to the Toronto Pearson Airport a few hours before the departure, we received the following email from Lufthansa : ""This email is to inform you that Lufthansa is currently not accepting any animals in hold at this time. As you are currently booked to travel with a dog, kindly make alternate arrangements or call our Reservations at 1-800-645-3880 We apologize for any inconvenience. Thank you."" Being 30 minutes from the airport, packed in a car with the kids, dog, luggages, dog cage, we called the given number. It was busy for 25 minutes than the Customer Service confirmed the fact that no dogs allowed in hold on Lufthansa planes from that day. They don’t look for an alternate solution for us and if we don’t fly without the dog (How could we? What should we do with the dog?), it is considered a no-show situation. At the airport the frustrated Lufthansa staff confirmed the same. So we stuck in Toronto, lost our tickets and may be the chance to get back home in this crazy times. I know that these days/weeks are extremely difficult for all of us but the way how Lufthansa left our family with confirmed tickets on an other continent showing no interest of finding any solution for us - this is very disappointing. As we were rejected by Lufthansa, we tried to find an other company to take us home. KLM made efforts to find the way to offer tickets to us with the dog as well. We are still waiting for the  confirmation."

I got recalled to the US due to COVID and was not given an option while changing flights to select meals. When I went up to the counter before the flight to ask if I could get a vegetarian meal plan, the lady at the counter said she needed 24 hours in advance. When I told her I booked the flight less than 24 hours ago, she said it didn’t matter. I cannot believe that for a 12 hour flight booked less than 24 hours in advance that there is no way to get meal accommodations. Her attitude was unacceptable."

I’ve been trying to contact them for three weeks to get a refund on a flight that I can no longer make because Jordan has banned all Italian citizens. Today after 35 calls I finally get to talk to the operator who tells me that he reimburses my ticket. Most of the time, no one answers the phone, and when someone answers, they don’t solve the problem."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Singapore,Feb-20,5,5,5,5,,5,5,yes,10,  Munich to Singapore. Very nice experience. Exclusive food. Great seats.

,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Billund to Frankfurt,Mar-20,4,3,3,,,2,4,yes,6,Billund to Frankfurt. Ground staff were slow and had to make new boarding passes for all passengers.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Toronto,Mar-20,4,5,4,3,2,2,4,yes,8," Frankfurt to Toronto. Whenever I can, I often fly with Lufthansa. The standard, quality and service are mostly the same, so I know what I'm getting. The ground staff at the airport were very slow and had a dull attitude. The service on board was fantastic, great praise to the staff. Messages over the speakers were given in flawless German, English and French. The airplane that was over 22 years old, but well maintained, though it has been a long time since it was last used for major service and had the cabin replaced. The internet onboard was extremely slow, although I pay 29 euros to get extra fast internet, it was not possible to send or receive pictures. All in all a good service, good flight and good airline company."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Moscow,Mar-20,3,4,4,1,,4,4,yes,7,  Frankfurt to Moscow. The cabin crew are very professional and cheerful. The service on board is correct. The plane is old and has no screen. Despite this it was a pleasant flight.

The intra-European flights are above average. Really well kept planes, good service on board and friendly cabin crew. The Frankfurt Singapore leg has the huge advantage from a passenger perspective to fly on the A380 but the seats in economy are really uncomfortable and the onboard service is a joke considering its a 13 hour flight."

,A320-200,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Venice to Frankfurt,Nov-19,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"Venice to Frankfurt. I was booked on a Lufthansa flight to Vienna via Frankfurt, the day before on the 6th of November they canceled the flight from Frankfurt to Vienna, leaving me with no information for hours. I started to call the Lufthansa customer service with no success, and I have proceeded to call the Austrian air. I ended up calling the Senator Lufthansa service, due to the status of my uncle, hoping to get some help from their side. After approx. 1h 30min on the phone I finally got connected to an English-speaking gentleman who apparently decided to help me. I´ve asked him what the solution would have been and he didn´t have any information regarding it, therefore as I had to go back to Vienna due to work business I asked him to rebook me to any flight within the star alliance airlines, and he mentioned just the possibility to fly via Brussels, although there was still a spare place via Zurich with SWISS. I received an Email confirmation with my flight to Belgium with Brussels airlines and proceeding with an Austrian Airlines flight to Vienna. I wanted to check- in online but on Brussels airlines it was not possible, but for the flight with AUA yes. I was a bit concerned, but I thought due to the strike this could have been normal. I arrived a bit earlier to the airport and at the check-in counter by giving them my documents their answer was “we don´t have any flight booked under your name” I was very furious as it was looking like there would have not been any solution to fly back on that day. I had to talk to other three people, until someone could have started helping me out for it, the only supervisor for five star alliance in an international airport… ridiculous, and neither from the airline but from the group S.A.V.E., company operating in Venice airport. They had to call several times, many Lufthansa desks until they told me they would have had to rebook me on a flight via Zurich (the one I´ve seen the day before, but which was never offered to me…) It was a kind of realizing news they gave me, although I was stuck at the airport for about 4 hours as it was way much earlier my scheduled flight to Brussels. I´ve asked for a small recognition or compensation as I would have been passing 4/5 hours in Venice, and they marked very much that as I asked, they gave me the lounge access, by doing “an enormous exception”"
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Cape Town,Jan-19,4,3,4,4,,3,4,yes,7,"  Frankfurt to Cape Town in January 23019 operated with an old A340-300. Very busy flight and fully booked, and our seat was the last one, or almost. For being 190 cm tall it was  very spacious and clean. Took off and dinner was served with a very slow time due to the completely fully booked flight, but this would have not been an issue, if although being the last one the hostess would have not arrived by giving us the choice to choose between vegetarian or meat meals and ending his sentence by saying that he just had meat. The steward was very nice, because although we were not expecting while eating, he brought us some spare dishes from Premium economy, which was a nice touch to make it up to our satisfaction, which was worth to it. Short sleep and bright good morning over Namibia´s desert with a quiet tasty breakfast, after it we were shortly landing. A fact which I didn´t like  t all that being right in front of the galley I was able to hear the whole conversations of the crew. IFE system was working very well and up to date. In overall I´d fly again with Lufthansa, as well because I´m a loyal member to since years."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Frankfurt,Feb-20,3,1,1,1,,2,2,no,3,"  Singapore to Frankfurt. They let one passenger get off the plane just as we were about to depart because they felt unwell. This meant we sat on the runway for an hour despite the captain saying it would only cause a 10-15 minute delay. I had to sit with the seatbelt fastened for an hour after take off because of ‘bad turbulence’, even though there was almost no turbulence. The air hostesses were loud and shouted across passengers from one end of the plane to the other while we were waiting to be released from our seats. They don’t respond to the button which notifies them that a passenger requires their assistants. I must have pressed mine 20 times before someone came to help me. The cabin staff could not confirm whether or not we would land on time and no one said anything about the delay.  I missed my connecting flight due to the 53 mins delay on arrival and had to sit in Frankfurt airport waiting for a new flight. My food was awful, my breakfast is near inedible and mostly consists of snack items. The inflight WiFi didn’t work. It never takes me to a page in which you can access the Internet. My entertainment screens didn’t work, you have to punch the screen to navigate the entertainment system. I can’t blame Lufthansa for children screaming, but I will say that it is ridiculous that we are living in 2020 and we don’t have the option of child-free seating areas. No one wants to sit near screaming infants. I will not fly with this airline again."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Frankfurt via Chennai,Feb-20,3,5,4,3,1,4,5,yes,9,"  I booked the tickets long back in April for the vacation in December - February. After booking, I was very worried given some of the bad reviews in different forums about Lufthansa. But the reality was different, there was some delay in Paris airport with the boarding. But the travel from Paris to Frankfurt was smooth. I had a transit flight to Chennai within an hour. The staff were waiting for us to take us to the passport check and they were with us till we stepped into the flight. I was travelling with my 11 month old baby. They have provided a bassinet once the flight had taken off. The food was okay and we reached Chennai on time. Regarding the return flight from Chennai, it was completely smooth. The only problem that I found with Lufthansa is the seat comfort for the 10 hour flight. The cabin crew were extremely humble and I recommend Lufthansa."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Addis Ababa to Los Angeles via Frankfurt,Jan-20,3,2,3,1,,4,3,no,5,"  Addis Ababa to Los Angeles via Frankfurt. The staff were friendly and helpful, but sparse only really showed up for food and beverage service. I used the call button three times, only to have it go off after about half an hour. Out of curiosity, I left it on when they appeared for beverage service. What annoyed me was that a few passengers had the shutters up during the lights out portion of the flight and it was hard for light sleepers like myself to get to sleep. And what's with turning on the lights with over 5 hours to go, serving coffee and tea, then turning out the lights again?  Sparse is also the word I would use for the entertainment.  Ethiopia Airlines had Friends, The Big Bang Theory, etc. On Lufthansa you get BMW Customer Races. The touch screen was from the 90s, and hard to figure out.  The one on the Addis to Frankfurt route was much better. All that said, the cabin was clean and the airplanes appeared safe. The staff were friendly when they were there."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Houston to Frankfurt,Jan-20,3,3,3,2,,4,4,yes,6,"  Houston to Frankfurt. Touch screen entertainment a little dated, touch screens cumbersome and range of movies fairly European (German) biased and music heavily weighted towards classical. There was no water offered which made getting any hard as I had a window seat and the man in the aisle was asleep. On other hand, I had booked through expedia and was allowed to change my ticket return date online which I appreciated."

Bought another flight from Manchester same day to Istanbul cheaper with check in luggage and direct. Coming back from Istanbul, check in, our ticket was cancelled because we missed our outbound flight. They said that we missed the connection flight in Frankfurt while we didn't even take the flight from Manchester. We had to buy another ticket with them. What if we didn't have no money coming back from our holiday? So they cancel your ticket and you have to pay another ticket. "
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Hong Kong,Jan-20,1,3,1,1,,3,2,no,3, Frankfurt to Hong Kong with Lufthansa. This was an old aircraft. Entertainment system slow to respond with limited choice. Also hard drives under seat in front reducing leg room. My food was inedible on this and previous flight from HKG to Munich. Airline needs to upgrade aircraft and sack their catering supplier. On upside staff were good.
✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Chicago to Belgrade via Munich,Jan-20,2,4,4,2,,4,3,no,3,"  When calling Lufthansa Service Center  to confirm carriage of ski equipment I was told that the price for ski bag would be $130/one way. At the airport, check in agent insisted that the price is $230 one way and that the Service Agent on the phone was not correct. At that point I had no choice (could not just leave my skis at the airport) and opted to upgrade my flight for $400 but the ski bag had no additional charge (free). I find this to be very poor on Lufthansa part since their agent on the phone quoted the wrong price. At the same time the check in agent at O'Hare displayed unprofessional behavior refusing to address this issue. The flight itself in their Premium Economy was below average product. No priority boarding or check in, poor service from cabin crew and my food was below standard of what is a 5 star airline. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A340,Solo Leisure,First Class,Munich to Bogota via Frankfurt,Dec-19,1,5,5,4,,5,1,yes,6,"  The First Class Lounge in Munich was excellent. The first flight from Munich to Frankfurt was in business. The seats  are the same as in economy class. Only the next seat remains free. Drinks and food are offered. In addition to the First Class Lounges, there is also a First Class Terminal in Frankfurt. But this can only be achieved on the outside. You have to leave the normal terminal to reach it. But it's worth it. The first class terminal is very good. The bathtubs were not available, you can only shower. You are brought to the plane by luxury car. The cabin of the First Class in the A340 and especially the seats are disappointing.  The seats offer hardly any privacy. My seat was very dirty but my complaint was answered promptly and  compensation was created. The service and the food, however, are excellent. Personal Assistant in Bogota was very good!"

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Denver to Frankfurt,Jan-20,,,,,,3,3,yes,4,"  We have received multiple last minute flight delay text announcements for our Denver to Frankfurt flight. These delays of more than 6 hrs are causing significant financial loss for temporary accomodation, missed connection flights and a loss of work and school days for us amd our kids. So far all of our attempts with Lufthansa customer service in both the US and Europe have been very unsuccessful, with Lufthansa offering zero support to us. No information on cause of delay or if further one is expected, no cost reimbursment offer, no meal voucher, no lounge access or upgrade. "
Not Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Helsinki to Manchester via Munich,Jan-20,4,5,3,,1,5,3,yes,7,"  Recently flew from Helsinki to Manchester via Munich. Very impressed with Lufthansa as well as Munich airport staff. Had a tight connection (45 minutes) in Munich to change terminals and go through security, before finding the new gate. Flight from Helsinki was significantly delayed, so arrived in Munich late, and would have missed the second flight. However, an airport representative for Lufthansa met passengers on the Manchester flight straight from the plane, and seamlessly guided us through the airport, involving a drive down the highway, so we were able to catch the flight with a few seconds to spare. Would also recommend Lufthansa as an airline; professional staff, apologetic for delays and drinks served although the two flights were short. Only criticism is it took eight hours to get from Helsinki to Manchester- when the actual flying time was only around 4 hours."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Family Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Hong Kong,Jan-20,4,2,3,3,5,3,3,no,6," Underwhelming experience. Upgraded via their bidding/make us an offer system and reserved seats upstairs. Boarding was late and a little all over the place. Seat and mattress were comfy but not great. Temperature was on the warm side upstairs and when I mentioned this, as I woke up very warm, something I was not used to, I was told ‘it’s always warmer upstairs than downstairs. Went downstairs to business to check and the temperature was much better. Screen size for entertainment is good but for a screen that is that far away, the writing for the menu etc should be bigger. Had to put on my reading glasses to read the on screen options. Left FRA an hour late due to long taxing and de-icing, but pilot made up time to arrive into HGK 40mins late. The person who served me was nice and personable, the rest were just going through the motions as quickly as possible. Went to the kitchen a few times to get water. Had to ask for ice and was served out of almost flat mineral water bottles. Soft drinks were served out of bottles into glasses, small amounts, had to ask for more. Food was reasonably tasty but nothing special and portions were small. More of a Degustation size/type menu than proper meals. Very disappointing. My wife and daughter, who were sitting further up front could not get another croissant nor the scrambled egg choice for breakfast because they were none left and the server was grumpy to them. On this particular flight, the non-engagement and lack of empathy to me from some of crew was only exceeded by arrogance in offering this mediocre service and menu."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Beijing,Jan-20,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Munich to Beijing. I had to book Lufthansa for my Europe travel because it was pretty much the only option available. I had the expectation that it was going to be a decent airline because it is “German” and Germans brag about their quality and attention to detail. Well one flight was worse than the other: 1. Unfriendly Staff 2. Very average plane 3. Poor quality food 4. Extra alcohol was served to drunk passengers that were singing the whole night on my flight to Madrid and they kept receiving more alcohol - so we could not sleep the whole night. Today Munich to Beijing and to finish ruining my trip we are a family of three with an infant and this airline brag about being “family-friendly” well they have given us seats separate all over the plane - no help and no respect. This is without a doubt the worse airline I have ever used, such a big disappointment. I live in Australia and I am used to the great service we receive from Qantas, I think Germany needs a decent aerline."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-300 / A320neo,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Chennai via Frankfurt,Dec-19,5,4,4,4,,5,4,yes,9," London to Chennai via Frankfurt. Overall very positive experience. Short hops between LHR-FRA were on new A320-neos in both directions and were perfectly comfortable with a small snack provided. Long haul A340-300s used to Chennai say they are 'operated by Lufthansa Cityline' but the passenger experience is identical to normal Lufthansa. Seats are comfy enough with adjustable headrests, sufficient pitch for 6'2 male and decent recline for night flying; managed to sleep almost 5 hours! Although the planes may be getting on now, the interior feels very freshly refurbished and still love Airbus A340/A330 planes in economy with just 2-4-2 layout - much better than Boeing's now standard 3-4-3. Entertainment was good quality screen with decent enough selection with probably about 70-odd movies though a poor selection of mostly German TV programmes. The meal just before Christmas was delicious goose, sauerkraut and dumplings, and with metal cutlery too, then a small sandwich-sized snack before landing. Toilets were kept clean (though maybe best to avoid being too close to them as they got a bit whiffy at times and with all 5 loos together in the middle of the plane, lots of footfall during flight), cabin crew were efficient and were perfectly friendly with me - as a German speaker they seemed to reserve a special extra level of smile when someone spoke German, but I saw several being very direct with other non-native English speakers regarding putting bags in lockers and one seat assignment at the start of the flight. An Indian chap in his 40s found someone sitting in his seat and sought help from an FA to talk to the person, to which she replied condescendingly, ""I think you're old enough to ask that yourself, aren't you?"" That aside, they were good, the pilot kept us informed well of minor delays and most flights arrived on time. Not cheap at Christmas, but better price than competition and I would happily fly with them again."

It was the well known Lufthansa quality. Although the Caterer LSG Skychefs was on strike Lufthansa build a small food court at the Munich airport to provide food and drinks that you could take on the plane. The longer flight had normal catering. All three of us ordered special food and it tasted very good. And the rest (films, chair, service etc.) was very good."

Decided to give Lufthansa a try after hearing great things and afraid to say was sorely disappointed. Paying a premium to receive a higher degree of service onboard, I was definitely left wondering how they’ve earnt a reputation as a 5* airline. Crew friendly enough, but three hour flight from FRA to MLA with catering consisting of a kid size chocolate Milka sponge and only water available on the trolley.  I’ll be steering clear of LH in future!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A320 / A320neo,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Paris to Frankfurt,Dec-19,3,4,3,,,2,3,no,3,"  Paris to Budapest via Frankfurt. Very disappointing. There was a very long queue for check-in at Paris. The on-board selection of food and bevrages is worse than other European carriers. The connection time at Frankfurt is very short and inadequate considering the size of the airport and the distance between aprons and gates: we spent 15-20 minutes in a bus to get to the terminal after landing. Inside the terminal, I had to walk 15 mins to get to my next gate. I almost missed my flight. In addition, my baggage was not loaded in time onboard the plane: I didn’t receive it at Budapest. It only arrived next day to my home. Lufthansa did not meet my expectations."
✅ Trip Verified ,CRJ900,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Gdansk,Dec-19,3,4,3,,,3,4,yes,6,  Munich to Gdansk. Short 1 hour flight to Gdansk for a 5 day holiday. These short hop flights are always on a remote stand and never seems to get it right. This time boarding was called and we waited till most of the people had moved through before going to the gate. Once through we spend the next 10 minutes waiting on the air-ridge for the bus to arrive. Flight was late departing by about 20 min but made up 10 during the flight. Service was friendly with a sandwich and drinks served on the 1 hour flight and my 3 year old got a colouring in book. Seats are okay for the short leg. De-planing again through the pouring rain and a short walk to the terminal. Functional flight but nothing special.
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Helsinki to Munich via Barcelona,Dec-19,4,1,1,1,,1,1,no,1," Helsinki to Munich via Barcelona. Horrible experience with Lufthansa. I paid more than 200 euros for an intraeuropean flight thinking it would worth it as I was travelling with a prestigious airline called Lufthansa. Chaotic boarding experience in Helsinki, which was supposed to be ""organized"" by groups, but it actually resulted in the opposite effect: chaos. Boarding in Munich was not organized by groups and it was much more clear and faster. Ground staff in Helsinki, impolite and arrogant when people approached to ask what if they could board. The only food they gave was a packet with 2 biscuits, an exactly the same on the second flight. On both flights they only served water, no other drinks or food available. Flight was completely full and packed. Crew distributed the biscuits right after take off, turned off the lights, closed the curtain and started to chat loudly in German in the galley. They did not show again until it was time to land. I sent a complaint 7 days ago and they have not replied. Next time use low cost (same experience), use Air France, Iberia or Finnair."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to Billund via Frankfurt,Dec-19,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,1, Milan to Billund via Frankfurt. Absolute utter trash.

✅ Trip Verified ,CRJ900 / A321,Business,Economy Class,Gdansk to Tel Aviv via Munich,Dec-19,4,4,3,,,3,2,yes,6,"  Flew from Gdansk to Tel Aviv via Munich and return via Frankfurt. No jetbridge used upon arrival in TLV. Crew polite and professional. Unfortunately, due to catering issues there was no hot meal on return flight, what happens on LH flights recently.  Compensation fortunately received, but only as will gesture and in symbolic amount upon feedback request. I appreciate rich beverage service that were distributed a few times during single flight. Cabin a bit cramped as for 4hr flight, but generally pleasant and clean. I recommend when the flight is not significantly more expensive than competition. I don't think that it deserved being 5 star airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,San Francisco to Paris via Frankfurt,Dec-19,,,,,,1,1,no,2,"  San Francisco to Paris via Frankfurt. I never received any confirmation email after my purchase, no payment confirmation. The only way to find my reservation was from a screen capture I took which had the reservation number. I selected seats when I booked but if you don’t go back and pay to lock them you will be moved. But I received no information about this. I am 320lbs and need an aisle seat which I always make sure I have during my booking but now they place me in a middle seat. I realized that there was the same problem on the second leg of my flight and was able to correct it but none of the 3 persons I talked to even checked that to try to at least save my other flights.  Their app is so awful it never works. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dallas to Lagos via Frankfurt,Dec-19,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I was supposed to fly Lufthansa on 16th December 2019 from Dallas Fort Worth, departing at 4pm with my 8 years old son to Lagos via Frankfurt. On my way to the Airport, we missed our terminal and before we could find our way back to the terminal, it was already 3:05pm. The counter who told me that the counter closed at 3:00pm and staff told us he will not be able to helps us. They told us to call Lufthansa's helpdesk, I called for nothing less than 13 times, but Lufthansa refused to help us.  I  lost $700 for the cancellation of the tickets.  I will never go near Lufthansa again."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320Neo + Boeing 744,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Marseille to Rio de Janeiro via Frankfurt,Dec-19,2,5,5,5,4,4,5,yes,8," A short flight to Frankfurt, with excellent FRA Terminal A Senator lounge (food & drinks). However Wi-Fi is not adapted to the quantity of passengers at lunch time, and connection was very slow. Fabulous shower at Term C Senator lounge at dinner time. Great wi-fi and poor food! Different and cheaper drinks than Term A. Weird. Is it because Term C is dedicated to South-American and Israel flights at nigh ? I hope not. Fabulous crew, service, food, amenities, etc.. on board B747-400. Pajamas (only upper part! passengers have no legs). Christmas gifts. But, the lady is old and you can feel it: toilet lights did not work, noises everywhere, speakers not audible, and uncomfortable seat."

I will not fly Lufthansa again. Very poor service, I expected more."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-360,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Stockholm to New York (JFK) via Munich,Dec-19,4,5,5,5,1,5,5,yes,9," Despite some slight delays, Lufthansa really made sure to make the trip an enjoyable one overall. The cabin was very clean, the inflight entertainment system worked excellently (with a wide selection of movies), food/catering was great and tasty, the flight attendants very service-minded, efficient and helpful. The Premium economy seat was quite spacious (although a bit hard) and well worth its price. At least if you're my height (187 cm) and need some extra legroom in order to not cramp up completely. The only disadvantage on the long-haul Airbus-models is that you can't control the airflow above you like you can on the Boeing-aircrafts which is why I don't give this experience a perfect ten, combined with the poor Wifi-connectivity (which didn't affect me since I didn't need to use it). Another cool feature on Lufthansa's A340-360 aircrafts is the downstairs location of the lavatories for Premium-economy and economy classes. I just feel bad for the elderly who might have to walk down there on shaky legs."
Not Verified ,A321 / A319,Business,Economy Class,Helsinki to Bucharest via Munich,Dec-19,4,5,1,,,1,1,no,5,"  Booked tickets last minute Helsinki to Bucharest via Munich due to late confirmation of a conference and wanted to avoid Frankfurt Airport this time due to some delays as well as missed baggage earlier. How wrong we were! The flight HEL-MUC on a Sunday night was  uneventful, however, LH seems to have severe catering problems from/to MUC and a small biscuit is not my idea of a five-star airline. There was a 15 min delay from HEL although we left on time and the plane parked at the furthest gate (K03) in the satellite terminal, which forced us to run like horses first to the train between the terminals, then to passport control and again to the furthest gate (H08) in the main terminal. We made it, but some connecting passengers didn't. Moreover, my spouse's luggage was left behind at MUC and we're still waiting for the bag at our Bucharest hotel although the agent told us the bag would to reach us by Monday afternoon. MUC-OTP is operated twice a day by LH. LH sells very tight connections through MUC (30-50 min between flights) which seems to be too optimistic. We are seasoned travelers on several airlines and understand operational challenges to cause problems every now and then. However, these two flights with minimal catering and a missed bag are not the Lufthansa we're used to through MUC. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Los Angeles to Franfurt,Nov-19,5,5,2,4,,5,4,yes,8,  Los Angeles to Franfurt. Overall not a bad flight. Boarding at LAX was super easy using biometrics. All you have to do is have the machine scan your face and you're good! No boarding pass or passport. The airplane was extremely clean. My meals were somewhat disappointing and my breakfast was nearly untouchable. IFE was somewhat unresponsive. Movie selection was good. Crew was extremely nice and helpful.
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-600,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Los Angeles,Dec-19,4,4,3,5,,4,5,yes,7,"  Munich to Los Angeles. Overall a pretty good flight! The ground crew was nothing to be noted of. Seat wasn't bad, but a bit short on room. IFE was nice and new and very responsive. The restrooms were downstairs, which was pretty cool and made them pretty large and comfortable. The crew Was nice, but they turned on all the lights to pass out ice cream, which woke some passengers, and seemed somewhat unnecessary. There were also snacks and water bottles in the back. Food, other than the ice cream, was untouchable, but luckily I wasn't hungry for this flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Economy Class,Rome to Frankfurt,Dec-19,2,2,1,,,1,2,no,1,  Rome to Frankfurt. We were forced to check our carry-on luggage. We were told the flight was full. It was not. At least 15 free seats. Empty overhead bins. Same carry-on we have used for years.  We will be forced to wait at or destination for an extra or to get our bags and clear customs. That was the point of carry-on only travel. To miss the hassle. When we hit on board there were bags larger than ours in the overhead bins. 
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Singapore via Munich,Dec-19,5,1,1,4,,4,3,no,6,"  Copenhagen to Singapore via Munich. The A350 is a rather comfortable aircraft. However, service standards were below par, we asks if we could get second toothbrush and a male cabin crew said no. On our way home, the breakfast for our flight from Munich to Singapore, was a sandwich with a pack of yoghurt and biscuit. The sandwich was not even heated and was cold and hard. My journey towards Copenhagen on 10 Jan, came with hot breakfast. Why served a cold sandwich when the passengers aren't even flying budget?"
Not Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Moscow to Belgrade via Munich,Jun-19,5,4,4,3,3,3,2,no,2,"  Moscow to Belgrade via Munich with Lufthansa. The flight to Munich was fine - we arrived on time, not many people on the flight, overall it was okay. However, a flight to Belgrade was a nightmare. Flight was delayed for a half an hour and we had to emergency land in Vienna because of lack of fuel. We have arrived in Belgrade almost four hours later. After that, we claimed for refund because of +3 hour delay. I was rejected because of the ""bad weather"" in Belgrade. Also, flight to Moscow had delay for two and a half hours because of the weather in Munich (I have to be honest it rained a lot)."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Frankfurt,Nov-19,4,5,4,,,4,5,yes,8,"  London to Frankfurt. Very good flight with Lufthansa.

✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-400,Business,Economy Class,Orlando to Amsterdam via Frankfurt,Nov-19,1,2,2,3,2,2,4,no,4,"  
Orlando to Amsterdam return via Frankfurt. Disappointing. Outbound flight was 90 minutes late. Once airborne, 4 of 8 lavatories available to Economy were ""out of service"" for the duration resulting in long lines, etc. Inflight service only fair, limited beverage selection, even for purchase. IFE okay. Of course seat width, pitch and hardness were awful. Love the plane, hate the configuration. No info pre-landing about connections or ground personnel to facilitate what became a tight connection due to delayed arrival. Return to Orlando, possible same aircraft. Problem this time was logistics of transfer in Frankfurt. Inbound flight from AMS late and then gate hold issue. Close connection quickly became a crisis. Ironically, I had hurt my back during trip so requested assistance in transfer. None was present on arrival in Frankfurt. Ground agent said gate change had messed up meeting. Arrived Terminal 1 gate 29, outbound Concourse Z gate 69 with 20 minutes to connect! Ground agent scolded me for making too tight connection. I said LH booked it that way, I am just the customer. Finally contract ground service arrived and two women loaded me into wheelchair and sprinted me through concourse, Passport Control, through tunnel, up elevator and then onto electric cart for high speed ride to Gate Z 69 which was at least a mile downrange, still. Made it just in time. If I had not had excellent help from ground personnel, would have definitely missed the one daily flight to Orlando. LH was non-responsive at best and spent more time trying to assign blame to me, than fix the problem.  I always thought LH performed well, if somewhat sternly. This trip the execution was awful, about what I would expect on a discount carrier at best."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Boston to Berlin  via Munich,Oct-18,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  I had 2 business class round trip tickets to Germany with Lufthansa and in October 2018 needed to make a change in date. While on their online site I inadvertently clicked on ""cancel flight"" instead of ""change flight"". When I called Lufthansa to explain the mistake, they said that ""a refund had already been processed and there was nothing else they could do"". The refund received was $95 for $9,000 worth of tickets! The $95 refund was sent immediately (imagine that) and that closed their case. After several communications explaining the on-line error, they continued to say that ""because a refund had been sent (for $95), there was nothing else they could do"". Of course the responses came from another company that appeared to be from India. Beware of dealing with Lufthansa, it cost me $9,000 and I received nothing."
✅ Trip Verified ,A330,Business,Business Class,Amsterdam to Malabo via Frankfurt,Nov-19,2,3,,,,3,1,no,3," Amsterdam to Malabo via Frankfurt. Missed my connecting flight in Frankfurt due to fog. But one hour delay on a flight of 50 minutes is not acceptable. And offering alternatives like Ethiopian Airways on a ticket of 5000 Euro is a bit offensive. But it's always trouble at Frankfurt airport. No way to catch a connecting flight with a stopover of 60 minutes. They park the plane on one end, you take the bus and need to find a connecting flight at the other end. Always need to run, but in this case the price of this ticket, they could have waited 15 minutes. So I had to wait a full day to take the next plane to Malabo. Also, what a strange configuration with tv screen not in front of you"
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-400,Business,Business Class,Denver to Frankfurt,Nov-19,1,1,1,3,4,3,1,no,3,  Denver to Frankfurt. The worst business class flight I have taken. The service was slow and unconcerned. I asked for a second bottle of water and was told they have no more available. I was handed a plastic cup to fill and was told I could use to water pitcher. My food was terribly over cooked. 
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Moscow,Nov-19,1,2,1,,,3,1,no,1,"  Munich to Moscow return. Check in normal, flights on time. Old Airbus without IFE and uncomfortable seats. On the flight the seat would not recline. Flight attendants doing only the necessary. Also from cockpit no information about the route etc, just c greeting. Food was a choice between pasta and chicken. Chicken was tasteless and my bread roll was dry and not warmed up. On the way back only a sandwich. When I complained the answer was: we have problems with catering. Full price airline for low fare service."
Not Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Newark to Copenhagen via Frankfurt,Nov-19,4,3,5,3,,5,5,yes,8,"  Return home from Newark to Copenhagen via Frankfurt. Flying newish 747-800. Economy class. Everything about the two flights went well. On-time departures and arrivals. Good service, no nonsense, on ground and in the air. Special meal pre-ordered: very good. Special meals seems to be more fresh than the mainstream fodder served. TV screen disappointing tiny, like in the 80's. Not that responsive to fingertouch control. Got what I expected from crossing the Atlantic safe. Missing that little extra touch, making a good journey great. The personal touch. Will fly Lufthansa again."

I have nothing negative to say about the flight crew who did an excellent job! Very friendly people, and a smiling and very good quality service! However, the condition of the cabin is not worthy of such a renowned company. My seat was defective, the button to adjust the position was out of order. Fortunately, this 
 was solved by the flight crew.

LH 2546 departure at 19.50 from L gates. Since I had the Ukrainian passport I stayed in the long queue in passport control for half an hour. I had run after passport control, but there is a train I had to wait between the gates and it was impossible to accomplish in less than 10 minutes. I was under the gate at 19.48, the gate was closed. The guy on the gate was nice. He gave me the advice to go to the support desk to handle the situation. After 5 minutes I was at the desk. The person who handled my issue wasn't sure what to do, I have been told that there are no flights for today. I got a booking for tomorrow's flight. I agreed on this and asked the supervisor lady where I supposed to stay for this night. I received the answer that this is my problem and I should be happy with the booking I have. I explained to her again that it is impossible to run all that way including passport control for 40 minutes. I received an answer that this is not airline problem, I have a Ukrainian passport and can't pass passport control fast enough. "

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Qingdao,Nov-19,4,5,4,5,4,4,5,yes,9,"  This is a positive review for Lufthansa - even if at the end I did not fly Lufthansa. I was booked on LH786 Frankfurt - Qingdao on 8 November 2019. Due to a strike the flight was cancelled, I was informed of this by Lufthansa 2 days in advance, and I was re-routed through Seoul on Asiana. So, despite flight cancellation, I arrived Qingdao just 3 hours later than planned. And Lufthansa even reserved seats on Asiana flights in business class according to my standard preference of aisle seat. Additionally, I had a Business Suite on Frankfurt - Seoul, a very good experience on Asiana Airlines. Excellent handling from Lufthansa of a difficult event. (My ratings are based on my previous experience on this flight)"
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Business,Economy Class,Munich to Montreal,Nov-19,1,5,4,5,5,5,3,yes,6,"  Munich to Montreal. Greatest service I had on the plane, the crew looked like they were happy to be at work and happy to serve the customers. We had whine, a good meal then more whine, choice of coffee, cognac and Baileys overall a big thumbs up to the cabin crew. Where things got bad is leg room-  I’m 6 foot 4 tall so I usually know which airline is ok and which is not for me and unfortunately, Lufthansa is not great in economy for tall people. My knees still hurt from the flight that was 15 hours before I wrote this review. It’s a shame that there is no regulation for tall people in aviation"
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Belgrade to Frankfurt,Nov-19,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,no,3,"  Belgrade to Frankfurt. Very bad customer service in Belgrade airport, the check-in was extremely unfriendly, impolite and rude to us.

Not Verified ,A321,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Munich,Nov-19,3,5,4,,,4,4,yes,9,"  Despite a very short delay the flight (I believe it was LH 068) to Munich from Dublin, got off within roughly 5 minutes of the scheduled time of departure. I was very pleased with the service and treatment received by the various flight attendants. They were professional, friendly, efficient and cheerful. The flight was overall pleasant and the food served was very good for airline food. I was a bit surprised to see so many people standing in the aisles when they should have been seated with their seat belts at least loosely fastened.  Lufthansa has long been my favorite airline for a long list of very good reasons, just some of which I've already listed. As a dual national, originally from the US but now living in Israel, I fly El Al more than I would choose if I had much of a choice.  I am not a frequent flier since I am a senior and a pensioner, but I try to make at least 1 or 2 trips outside my present home country per year. Munich airport does leave a bit desired for passengers I'm afraid since accessing the proper terminals and gates is via a train. Several signs inside the Munich terminal indicate terminal 1, but are in fact terminal 2. One should allow at least 2 hours between flights to get straight as to just where one must be in order to get to the proper terminal and gate on time for making connections for a continuing flight. I hope the signage at the airport in Munich is corrected soon. ."
✅ Trip Verified ,Not known,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Kiev via Frankfurt,Oct-19,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  Manchester to Kiev via Frankfurt. I will never use this company again. I pre-paid for 4 x seat locations. Two for £6 and two for £9. I did not get any of them and no refund either. I was put in the worse seat position I would have chosen. The food was a sandwich which was sub-standard to any other meal. Frankfurt security were awful. Next on the plane the pilot repeatedly said ""we are running a few minutes late due to some paperwork"", we were 1hour 20 mins late. My lift at Borispol arranged for 1.06 am had to wait until 2.20 am. On the return they had not allowed enough time to get through security at Franfurt for the second plane to Manchester. The plane landed only a few minutes late, but then there was a bus and then at security they were going really slow. With only 15 minutes to the second plane going. I had to push in by climbing under the tape barrier and ask a woman to let me go in front of her. There were a lot of people panicking and I got my plane with only minutes to spare. All this was very stressful."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,First Class,Chicago to London via Munich,Oct-19,5,5,5,3,,5,5,yes,10,  Chicago to London via Munich. This was my first flight on Lufthansa and I must say it was a wonderful experience. The attention and care we were given on the long haul flight from Chicago to Munich was extraordinary. I must mention the attentiveness of crew member Dominic was top notch! He went above and beyond the call of duty and made sure the flight was comfortable and enjoyable. I will definitely choose Lufthansa in the future.

✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Norfolk to Munich via Washington,Oct-19,2,3,1,4,3,3,2,no,4," Norfolk to Munich via Washington. Booked Luftansa years ago and loved flying with them. Unfortunately, this time my family flew round trip to Munich from Norfolk Va. and back, and were not so happy. Food was absolutely terrible. Horrible actually. The plane looked really worn down inside. Paid extra to sit together with family but that did not happen. Staff were nice and plane landed safely so thats all good but Luftansa was always top of the line flying for me. Sadly not any more."

✅ Trip Verified ,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Munich to Toronto,Oct-19,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,yes,10," After having flown Dreamliner on BA, AC and LY but never the competitor A350 I was delighted to experience the A350 for the first time by flying LH from Munich to Toronto. Compared to the excellent Dreamliner the A350 is providing an even better and more relaxing experience. I do believe that this is partially due to its bigger size. Lufthansa's business class is spacious, bright and airy. On this specific flight (22nd of October) the crew was not only good and professional but absolutely perfect in any aspect. Food was superb. An absolutely perfect flight experience."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320 Neo,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to London,Sep-19,1,4,3,,,4,5,yes,5,"  Frankfurt to London. I really do like Lufthansa, having done over 180 flights with them over the last six years, so this comment is not a one flight observation. What got me on this trip is the seat pitch on their new A320 Neo's, fine if you're small but if not, you'll find it uncomfortable and claustrophobic. Luckily this flight was empty and I had a whole row to myself, but anything longer than an hour, I will think twice before booking Lufthansa if the flight is operated by an A320NEO."
✅ Trip Verified , A320 NEO,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to London,Oct-19,3,3,3,,,4,3,yes,6,"  Frankfurt to London. I upgraded to Business on this sector as it was a reasonable cost and since I had a long layover at Frankfurt from Bahrain, needed the use of the Lounge. The flight was on time, and as expected it was the usual professional, polite but non engaging service on board. As it was a midday flight, a cold lunch/snack and warm bread was served, along with drinks. Comfort wise, there is no difference between Economy and Business seats. The seat pitch is the same, and though the empty middle seat offers more space, considering this is just an hour flight, it did not make any difference. The experience on the outbound journey in Economy and return on Business was just the same except for the food and bar service. I would  recommend this because it was a low price for the last minute upgrade."
✅ Trip Verified ,Airbus A330,Business,Premium Economy,Frankfurt to Bahrain,Sep-19,5,3,3,2,,4,4,yes,7,"  Frankfurt to Bahrain. I had done this route with Lufthansa before, and was happy to fly again with them. Despite the connection in Frankfurt (I was coming in from London), I find this flight more enjoyable than some other alternatives. On boarding, I was offered the usual nonalcoholic welcome drink, and we were away on time. Once the bar service was opened, I opted for a scotch on ice, but with a half litre bottle opened, I got a very small drink served! That was followed by a tasty lunch, wine, and I settled down to watch a movie on the IFE. The choice here is a very limited (compared to the likes of Emirates). On my return flight, which was late night, the service started with drinks and a delicious beef sandwich. 90 minutes before arrival a bland breakfast was served consisting of omelet and cold items. The seating on Premium Economy is very comfortable (2x3x2). The usual water bottle and small amenity kit was also provided. But as I was at a window seat, stepping out to use the toilet was difficult, especially as the passenger in the front seat had his seat reclining. My fellow passenger had to get off his seat to let me out. Overall Lufthansa offers a polite and efficient service, and good value for money, if you're not fussy about dates and times."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Economy Class,London to Frankfurt,Sep-19,4,3,3,,,5,4,yes,7,"  London to Frankfurt. From a day before departure, through to online check-in (with free seat selection), and right up to boarding, I was kept informed. Departed and arrived on time. The seat was comfortable, with a standard 31 inch pitch, and as I am small, was plenty enough space for me for the one hour flight. Soon after take off, unlike some other European airlines, a pastry snack and drink was swiftly served. Service, was formal, non-engaging, but quite adequate. However, on landing we had to be moved to a far away parking slot and it incurred a long bus ride, and further rail ride to the actual allocated terminal area. It took an extra 40 minutes to find my way to the gate to make my connecting flight to Bahrain. However, I think Lufthansa's Short Haul Economy product is OK. Nothing extraordinary to write about, yet nothing to complain about either."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Manchester to Dallas via Frankfurt,Oct-19,2,3,3,,,1,1,no,3,"  Manchester to Dallas via Frankfurt with one hour to move from one gate to another. When we arrived in Frankfurt (nine minutes behind schedule) , our onward flight was already boarding. We ran down corridors, up escalators and caught a train to get us to the correct Z area of the airport, and then we were told that we would have to go through security again. We were taken to the so-called fast security queue where 15 to 20 members of staff stood around doing nothing and doing it very slowly whilst increasingly stressed passengers listened to last calls being announced. Over an hour after landing, we had missed our flight. The girl on the customer service desk arranged for us to get our luggage back and  gave us a cursory apology for any inconvenience. Missing your bus is an inconvenience, but this has required us to alter our car hire, the friends meeting us in Dallas have had to hire another car, hotels for them and us at both ends of the journey, and we’ve missed the start of our tour. We are now booked onto tomorrow’s flight but we won’t be able to sit next to each other. We asked if we could sit in another area of the plane but the response was ‘I can’t bump other people out of their seats‘ which was obviously not something we had asked her to do."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Krakow to Lisbon via Munich,Oct-19,5,5,5,,,5,5,yes,10,  Krakow to Lisbon via Munich. I salute Lufthansa for serving vegetarian snacks and vegetarian dinners.  It would be wonderful if other airlines followed suit. 
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-400,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Vancouver to Glasgow via Frankfurt,Oct-19,1,1,2,1,1,1,3,no,1," We flew on a 4.00pm flight to Glasgow via Frankfurt. We were going to visit family with our 2 month old baby girl. To be short, the service was terrible. Stewards never offered to warm bottles, never bothered to check or ask how we were doing and when we did ask for some hot water it was given very abruptly. After only 2.5hrs of a 9.5 hour flight the cabin lights were turned off completely. This was not a red eye flight so I have no idea why this was done. When I got up to stretch and stand I was told within 2 minutes to go and sit down by the rudest stewardess I have ever encountered. She also badgered other passengers throughout the flight. There was also no safety briefing at the start of the flight and all the announcements were so garbled you couldn’t understand what they were saying, in German or English. There was no offer of assistance while de-planing and no offer of assistance in regards to where we go next for our next flight. Once we arrived in Frankfurt we were almost run over (literally) by a golf cart doing at least 15-20mph! We had to walk almost 2km to get to out next gate and when we went to the Lufthansa service desk for directions there was no one around (of course). Once boarding started we were driven halfway across the airport to board the aircraft outside. Flight to Glasgow was tolerable. I would never fly Lufthansa ever again. Old aircraft, cranky service and generally inhospitable."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Munich,Oct-19,2,3,3,,,1,1,no,1," Amsterdam to Munich. We booked almost two months in advance. When we arrived at the check in they said they had overbooked and if we could volunteer to go on another flight (KLM) leaving at the same time. I figured no harm so I ran to the other side of the airport only to be told by KLM that we had not been booked on that flight and that the gate was closed. So we had to run back all the way to Lufthansa to then be told they could get us on our original flight. In form of “compensation” they offered us €250 each and put us up in a hotel with a shuttle bus from the airport. But like the previous promise of another flight, the shuttle was non existent so we ended up paying for taxis out of pocket. Next day when we arrived early to follow the given instructions about the compensation once again, no one knew anything and everything they told us was wrong. The only thing we could do was file a claim online. Of course this is a very convenient way of not dealing with customers. I called and was told if I wanted to make a reservation of course I could talk to someone, but if I have a complaint that can only be done online, nice way of avoiding responsibility and not facing your many unhappy passengers. We filed the claims, I sent all the required emails and have received no reply. I am very frustrated with what I consider to be lies and lack of responsibility. Why should I have to miss my flight and pay €70 because they overbooked? So claims filed, and still no reply. Lufthansa promises are lies, don’t fall for it."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320/A319,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Berlin to Tivat via Frankfurt,Oct-19,3,4,3,,,3,3,yes,6," I flew from Berlin to Tivat via Frankfurt on 6 October in Business Class. The Senator Lounge in Berlin is in free fall. There was a lot of talk about the new Senator Lounge. In the end, the new one is worse than the old one. The choice of food and drinks is very limited. For breakfast, there used to be at least three choices of cold cuts and cheese; now, it is one each. The croissants are gone, the toast has gone, there is only one kind of sliced bread. There is no free champagne anymore, the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks selection has suffered considerably. Shame on Lufthansa for giving such a bad impression in their lounges in the German capital. The departure from Berlin was 30 minutes delayed because of the late arrival of the incoming aeroplane. However, the announcement was only made when it was already time for the pre-boarding announcement. As I was in a good position overlooking the apron, I knew that the aeroplane had not even come yet, but, to many other passengers, this came as a most unpleasant surprise, as a lot of them seemed to have short connection times in Frankfurt. The aeroplane left with a delay of more than 30 minutes; the flight itself was quite good. In Business Class, they served a tray containing a plate with slices of roast chicken, vegetables and pesto, accompanied by some bread rolls with butter as well as some panna cotta with cherry sauce and clotted cream. For me, there was enough connecting time in Frankfurt, as I knew exactly how I could get from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 quickly. I spent some 20 minutes in the Senator Lounge. It was quite empty for that time of day. The food served reflected the fact that the Oktoberfest in Munich had started. It was all very Bavarian – the same you get in the Munich lounges all year round. Within the 50 minutes I was in Frankfurt, the departure gate changed at least four times from B30 to B20 to B27 and finally to B28. The flight from Frankfurt to Tivat was the real disappointment. The flight was more than twice as long as the inner-German flight from Berlin to Frankfurt, but the food served on board to Tivat was exactly the same as on the previous flight. I mean how is this possible? How can it be that Lufthansa – a so-called 5-star airline – offers the same kind of food on two different flights at two different times of day with different flight duration? Frankfurt is Lufthansa‘s main hub; the vast majority of the passengers have connecting flights here. Is that the impression Lufthansa tries to leave? Austrian, a Lufthansa-group member, is able to serve a hot meal on all international flights no matter how long it is. Why is the parent company, Lufthansa, not able (or willing?) to do the same?"
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Athens,Oct-19,4,5,2,,,5,5,yes,8,"  Frankfurt to Athens. Made it to the airport at the last second. Thankfully we got to check in our luggage just two minutes before the time was up. Everything went so fast thanks to the helpful staff at the airport. Flight didn't board on time. The cabin crew was late because of the delay of another flight. We departed half an hour later than scheduled and arrived 15 minutes later than planned. The flight itself was very good. I don't prefer flying during the evening but this flight was really delightful. Excellent cabin crew, one was by far the friendliest flight attendant we have encountered in the past 15 years of regular flying within Europe. Overall a great experience, even though the food could have been a lot better."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321/A319,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Barcelona to Gdansk via Frankfurt,Oct-19,3,4,4,,,2,5,yes,7," Average flight from Barcelona (BCN) to Gdansk via Frankfurt/M in economy light. Aircrafts worn out a bit, but quite clean and comfortable for a short flight. FA polite and professional during both flights. Boarding process worse than on low cost carriers - slow moving long queues on both legs. Luggage weight and size checked what considering that passengers bend the rules is not bad. In FRA airport transfer with bus. Had to wait long time in cramped corridor at gate prior the bus arrival. I highly appreciate the complimentary beverage service including sparkling wine on short-haul. I recommend this airline as a great alternative for low cost carriers when affordable tickets available."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Venice via Frankfurt,Oct-19,2,5,4,,,1,1,no,2,"  London to Venice via Frankfurt. Booked connecting flights to Venice for short city trip - I live near LHR, most flights to italy from England from LGW - over an hour away. Every flight delayed- we made our connection (time supposed to be 1.5 hrs between flights) by minutes & having to run miles through Frankfurt airport! Why on a so called connecting flight Lufthansa do you park the incoming flight literally km away from the outgoing with minimal time. The only reason we made our Venice flight was because it too was delayed! On the way home  VCE to FRA delayed again ... absolutely no chance of making our connecting flight ... walking km again in the hideous Frankfurt airport - looking for Lufthansa help. All service desks closed, I asked at a boarding gate about our flight - staff pointed to a gate - theres no one there, your flight has gone! But my latest txt from Lufthansa says it too is delayed? Few more km walk out of secure area finally found service centre. Guy very helpful,  but then had to go thru security again. Thankfully our new later flight left on time finally home! For connecting flights LH need to give at least 3 hr time gap! Whole experience was an absolute nightmare. Sad because I have to say your cabin crew on all flights were exceptional - i fly with Singapore,Cathay lots reputable airlines but hands down your crew.just the best. "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Delhi to Frankfurt,May-19,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,no,1," Delhi to Frankfurt. Worst customer service ever. This airline is worst I’ve ever come across in handling customer complaints. My parent's flight with Lufthansa was delayed which resulted in missing their next flight from Frankfurt to Toronto. Overall they ended up taking additional layover and spent an extra 7 hours on their trip. I asked for a partial refund I was told $300 refund in June 2019. Customer support has asked for same verification documents over twice so far. It’s October 2019 and no refund has been issued yet. They don’t respond to email for days, when they do they ask for the same information that was already provided to them months ago. Very frustrating and poor customer service. Zero stars for this airline."
✅ Trip Verified ,B747-800,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to New York,Sep-19,5,2,1,3,,4,2,no,2,"  Frankfurt to New York. I've observed a deterioration of service quality and this latest return on the transatlantic legs proved to be bad. LH's Boeing 747-8 remains very comfortable in business class and the on-time performance is stellar. Not the service: the food served to me was dreadful, the wines were mediocre and the cabin staff rushed the service to the point of unpleasantness. The lavatory I saw in business class was not cleaned nor restocked. I do not understand why the food service on European routes is good while it is poor to dreadful across the Atlantic. My next booking will not be on Lufthansa"
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-600,Couple Leisure,Business Class,New York to Munich,Sep-19,3,3,1,2,,4,2,no,3," New York to Munich. One of my favorite routes and Munich airport is a joy. The seats on the A340-600 are tighter and less comfortable than on the 747-800 but it is a delightful aircraft. As seemingly always on Lufthansa, left on time and landed early. However, the food served was not good, OK very poor, and the wines were lousy. I've learned to just look at the breakfast tray on LH transatlantic and to eat a good one on the leg from Germany to Athens. Cabin staff was courteous and efficient. As on my return leg of FRA-JFK the totality of the experience is coach with reclining seats. What a shame, will have to look for an alternative airline next year."

Leg room is tight (my wife is 5ft. 9ins. and just hit whereas I would have been very uncomfortable if the flight was not half empty and I had a row to myself. Video screen was clear however the selections of music and movies was only okay, just a few new movies! Two drinks served after take off and dinner was a choice of a pasta dish or a beef stew, both were adequate but not memorable. Cabin crew were very attentive and the pilot updated us on a regular basis. Flight was on time. Since I got a great fare I would say this was a good experience!"
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Vancouver,Aug-19,4,4,4,4,,4,4,yes,9,"  Munich to Vancouver. We travel to Europe every year for vacation. This year, we flew from Europe to Canada and in the process, our luggage was misplaced. We arrived in Vancouver, Canada only to find out the news. Our luggage was delivered within 2 days of landing at home via a delivery service that was free of charge. Furthermore, we reached out to Lufthansa and the customer relations department was timely in their response and was kind. They acknowledged our concerns and inconvenience and offered a remedy package to show their apology. We were pleased with the way Lufthansa Customer Relations handled the situation. Accidents happen on a daily basis and nobody or no company is perfect but they went out of their way to make sure we were satisfied. We truly appreciate their generosity and concern. We enjoy flying with Lufthansa because they have been very respectful and polite over the years. They stated this, ""We are sorry for the inconvenience. We look forward to welcoming you on board in the near future and the opportunity to regain your confidence."" and I can honestly say that they have won me back."

Excellent cleanliness, excellent seat comfort, good staff, blow average food. Below average ground staff. The staff was average at best, they did their jobs with no emotion or caring to me. The amenity kit is lackluster as was my food. The wine selection is pedestrian. Food choices were all not available. I was told as I was in the rear of the cabin, my selections from appetizers to entrees were gone. The aperitifs were also not available. I took what was left. It is hard to fathom this airline is rated at 5 Star. The competition from AA for AF is much better. This is my last flight with this carrier. "

✅ Trip Verified ,A340,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Munich to New York,Nov-18,1,2,4,4,,5,2,no,2,"  Munich to New York. Really disappointed with Lufthansa business class seat.  The seat is narrow and offers no privacy. I found it very hard and uncomfortable. The distance between the seats is almost like economy class, there is no privacy divider. When in seating mode, there was not enough space for my arm and I kept hitting my neighbour with my elbow. There is no storage space to put things into. All my stuff ended up on the floor by the window.  The flight was full and perhaps because of that the service was not good, either. The cabin attendants looked harrased and did not smile, it was difficult to to get a drink as they were busy with a full cabin. Despite bad service, the food was good. Also, the in-flight entertainment was easy to use and had a lot of choice in English. But the seat is most important to me so I will not fly Lufthansa in long-haul business class ever again."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to Los Angeles ,Sep-19,3,2,2,1,,1,3,no,3,"  Frankfurt to Los Angeles. After my flight cancellation at the last moment, I was put on this flight via FRA. Lufthansa does many things right like their website, clean aircraft, and all the little amenities in economy like fluffy pillows, nice blankets and yummy little chocolates. This however, does not compensate the stone-faced smiles and grudgingly pleasant attitude to me. The staff's cold tone of voice to me and at times their tone deafness when you raise a small issue. I never feel a genuine welcome or a warmth from staff; both in-flight or on the ground. My IFE did not function. My food was half good and half institutional. I will never fly them again."
✅ Trip Verified ,A340 and A320,Couple Leisure,First Class,Nairobi to Zurich via Frankfurt,Sep-19,3,4,2,,,4,4,yes,7,"  NBO to FRA: The seats are ok but not very fancy. The foot rest area is narrow, especially at the window seat. Seat and buttons worked. The crew were friendly and courteous, albeit not all were efficient, maybe due to lack of routine. Cabin and washrooms were kept tidy. The plane's interior looks rather new. Boarding at NBO with business boarding first was swift, and the Swissport staff there very nice. We took off quickly, and it looked like an on-time arrival at FRA. The weak point is the food and food service. The flight kitchen at NBO seems to be unable to deliver quality food, at least not for business class. Compared to Swiss, which flew us to NBO, Swiss is worlds better, incl. the food. FRA airport is a complete hassle, and LH should not book short connecting times. We barely made our ZRH flight, but were the last ones showing up at the gate. PA system in A340: barely audible, especially the captain's announcements. In the A320 - perfect."
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Business,Business Class,Munich to Montreal,Sep-19,2,3,3,3,,4,2,yes,6,"  Munich to Montreal in Business Class. Having connected from Dublin, spent some time on the Senator Lounge which offers a great selection of food and beverages. Boarding was fairly orderly but started late. LH appears to be losing its discipline when it comes to on time boarding and departures. On board, the hard product offered decent space for one’s belongings but the fact that not every seat has direct aisle access remains a downside for LH business class. The seat offers limited privacy and the fact that it is angled towards the neighbour, makes it quite awkward in the fully flat position as a mere 1 inch divider separates the respective foot wells. The seat was narrow compared to business class seats found on other carriers. It was not particularly comfortable in the lie flat position. The service was in typical LH fashion, efficient but lacking warmth. The food and wine offerings were quite good however, the salad consisted of limp mesclun greens and was sort of thrown onto the tray. The snack served prior to landing was actually better tasting than the lunch offering consisting of a delicious soup and very tasty prawns. The IFE had a good selection and I especially enjoyed the cameras showing the exterior of the aircraft. The toilets were kept in immaculate condition throughout the flight. The flight departed late and arrived slightly behind schedule. Having flown on a number of other 5-star airlines, I found the overall experience not quite on par with LH peers in this category."

I am here trying to be fair and not let my upset cover all my review. I was calling Lufthansa customer service to select the seats for my wife. I called them 4 days before the flight time, they said we can't do that unless 23 hours before the flight. When I called them again on time the agent in customer service said she can't do the selection since the flight is less than 20 hours and we have no access to the seat maps anymore. She argued with me and closed the phone while I am talking. Shameful Lufthansa. I am using the company for me and family for 30 years."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Budapest to Miami via Frankfurt,Jul-19,1,1,,,,1,1,no,1,"  I took my dog with me on this trip and she is an ESA and I know that it is not recognized by interEuropean flights yet, it’s only recognized in the US. Now, before I took this flight with my dog I made sure the flight will be the most comfortable as possible for her. The rules are that dogs can fly in cabin as long as they are secured in their carrier during take off and landing and when the seatbelt light goes off the dog is allowed to sit in your lap. I asked the rules several times before traveling because she hates being in a carrier and goes crazy barking and crying. I even got her tranquilizers from the vet just for her to be able to deal with those few minutes she has to be in the carrier. This is the way we traveled to Europe a few weeks ago. Nice and smooth she made it thru.  Lufthansa banned me from flying their airline because my dog, who came out of her carrier by poking her head out, mid flight and was barking! This pilot demanded At the beginning of the flight to keep her in the carrier the whole flight and told me that that is the rules. My poor dog hates being in the carrier, I probably would’ve not brought her if that was really the rule because she barks and cries when she’s in the carrier. I asked the pilot why he would not use his own discretion with his rules, for my dog will make the whole plane crazy by barking while being locked in a small box. It’s the rules.  I did what he told me anyway and my dog barked for 25 minutes straight while I apologized to the other passengers. So we landed in Frankfurt to catch our connecting flight to Miami and the stewardess told me that we cannot board the plane. Mind you that flight to and from the US, ESA’s are allowed to sit on your lap the entire flight, landing, taking off and all. I was not able to board my flight in Frankfurt and was told to order another plane ticket with another airline, and that I will not be getting a refund or will they transfer my ticket to another airline.  When I demanded a copy of this so called report that was written about why I have been banned, no one could give any answers, no one could give me a real reason why I was not able to board. "
Not Verified ,A340-600,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Munich to New York,Nov-18,1,1,4,4,,4,1,no,2,"  Really disappointed with Lufthansa business class seat. Its a joke for which one pays a premium price. The seat is narrow and offers no privacy whatsoever. I found it very hard and uncomfortable. When it was fully flat I felt like I was in bed with a strange man as there was a stranger seated next to me and I was lying so close to him. The distance between the seats is almost like economy class, there is no privacy divider of any sort. When in seating mode, there was not enough space for my arm and I kept hitting my neighbour with my elbow. There is also no storage space to put things into. All my stuff ended up on the floor by the window. I have never seen a worse business class seat, ever. The flight was full and perhaps because of that the service was not good, either. The cabin attendants looked harrased and did not smile, it was difficult to to get a drink as they were busy with a full cabin, it took a long time for them to respond and then I felt like a nuisance asking for a glass of orange juice. Despite bad service, the food was good. Also, the in-flight entertainment was easy to use and had a lot of choice in English. But the seat is most important to me so I will never fly Lufthansa in long-haul business class ever again unless forced to. I cannot believe that an airline with such bad business class product can be a 5-star airline. Avoid."
✅ Trip Verified ,A380,Business,Economy Class,Singapore to Panama via Frankfurt,Sep-19,3,3,2,2,,2,2,no,5,"  Singapore to Panama via Frankfurt. Food isn't great. On the way back flying out from Panama to Frankfurt, they couldn't assign my seat number till boarding time (very odd). And by then they would replace my ticket entirely with ""new"" tickets after they have decided what seat to give me (which seems rather inefficient and wasteful). I'm guessing here they're trying to sell off them premium seats first. The seats in economy are cramp as you would expect.  All in all, my first and perhaps last with Lufthansa unless they can make the inflight meal on par with other airlines. And the ground staff with their tablets are just redundant."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320neo,Business,Economy Class,Berlin to Frankfurt,Sep-19,1,3,3,,,3,2,no,3,"  Berlin to Frankfurt. Lufthansa cramped in more seats in its A320neo than into its predecessor with the most uncomfortable seat comfort I have ever experienced. Seat pitch is minimal. The seat comfort back from Berlin to Frankfurt in one of the front rows of an A321neo was better, this is classified as preferred zone. There was a small tasty cake and beverage service on the flight but it was not a comfortable flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Marseilles to Vienna via Frankfurt,Jul-19,1,5,1,,,1,1,no,3,"  We were confirmed in Business Class from Marseille to Vienna via Frankfurt via FRA on July 13. However we decided to fly earlier on the 9th. There were no Business class available and we accepted to fly on Economy class. We had to pay for re-issuing the tickets, even being downgraded (US$40,00 each).  At MRS check-in, we were then offered an upgrade to Business Class from MRS to FRA, if we accepted to pay US$110,00 each. Of course we did not, as we initially had paid for Business Class. No way, supervisor refused, even aware of our Gold Status. We remained in Economy. Business Class on Marseille to Frankfurt  was empty indeed. LH should be aware that there are limits that offends common sense. In the past, RTW pax had a privilege status. Now, no class. Flights were fast and OK."

One of the best airlines I have travelled till now, but experienced low class service on my one trip with Lufthansa. Economy class passengers for any airlines are back bone base of customers and serving cold food and saying that they can't put it in microwave for economy has  posted a bad impression on me. My overall experience with this airlines is very good except these issues as they  depend on the behavior of staff."

I had the same feeling of no soul during the operation. Boarding in Nairobi was chaotic. The A330 is newer and more comfortable than the A340 we had on the way in. Flights were on time, luggage arrived at destination without any issues. The overall operation was efficient. The dinner on the NBO-FRA flight was disgusting.  I couldn't eat it (and I am normally not a picky person with food). Cabin crew disappeared after dinner service for the rest of the flight until serving a cereal bar (supposed to be breakfast) before landing. Quick and smooth transfer in Frankfurt. The flight home was on a new A320 Neo. Again, soulless service, but I didn't care as it was an hour-long flight only. Arrived in London on time."

Professional efficient service. No WOW factor. I would not rate this airline as 5 star from my economy class experience, but I would describe the operation as technically perfect. Flights on time, luggage arrived at final destination despite the short connection in Frankfurt and I  perceived the airline as reliable. However no human warm no smiles. A cup of tea and a biscuit was served on our first leg to FRA (one hour flight). On the second leg to NBO (7:30 hours flight), we were offered a round of drinks, a hot towel, lunch (nothing to write home about it), a round of water or juices mid-flight and a pre-landing snack. Overall an efficient operation with no surprises."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Business Class,London to Madrid via Frankfurt,Sep-19,3,3,1,1,1,2,1,no,2,"  London to Madrid via Frankfurt. Flights were late. Transfer between flights was an stressful experience even travelling on business, despite knowing we were late no assistance was provided to facilitate the transfer; I was taken to the terminal by bus to find my way through immigration (thankfully e-gates were working) and to reach the boarding gate just on time to board the second and final bus (in cramped condition). Hardly time to visit the toilet and certainly not opportunity to go into the Lounge. At the boarding gate I asked about my luggage and I was reassured by the staff, after checking the computer, that it had been transferred successfully to the second plane. After boarding the plane, lunch time, we were informed that there was no catering service at all due to the recurrent issue that they have had .. for over 2 months now. But being served just a wafer is totally unacceptable, they didn't make even the effort to get us a sandwich despite departing from their main hub. Credit must be given to the crew on board as they had to put up with this situation for not fault of their own but because of the incompetence and unprofessionalism of the company. To add insult to the injury my luggage didn't make it to the second plane and it was still in Frankfurt (despite being an easier journey through the airport than mine) so I had to spend another 25 extra minutes to go through the queue and forms at the baggage handling company desk in Madrid. I had to beg then for having it express delivered on that night (only Senators and HON members are entitled to such privilege) despite being Star Alliance Gold and Lufthansa Frequent Flyer. Fortunately the staff took pity of me and they managed to get it approved by Lufthansa. Needless to say that I sent the feedback form to customer services on the very same night. I requested for someone to call me as soon as possible. Instead, I have today (6 days later) the standard sympathetic email with the meaningless apology and the 'great' news that they will credit me with 10K miles and hope to see me on board again. A trip from hell would be an adequate title for this experience."

An acceptable small cold lunch was served however I found it for Lufthansa quite poor that soft drinks and wines were served in plastic in the business class. Frankfurt to Brussels is a very short flight - so only something small was served. Friendly staff on both segments. Unfortunately in Brussels a waiting time of luggage delivery of nearly 50 minutes and luggage labelled as priority arrived nearly as last.

Food was same that other airlines serve in economy class with plastic cutlery. No champagne (only really bad sekt) and wines seemed to be same as Economy. The worse thing was how they handled connecting passengers at FRA. We had a tight connection and the first flight was 15 mins late making our connection even tighter. Arrived on a bus stand. We had to rush to passport control & next gate. They said that gate will close 10mins before departure, arrived to the gate 5mins before dep only to notice that boarding had not started yet. No info was given to us. Would have been nice to know that there was no need to rush. 2mins before dep, received an e-mail about delay of our flight. Really badly handled. The crew on both flights was okay, nothing special. The gate personnel at FRA really unfriendly. No free wifi for business class."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Business Class,Brussels to Rome Fiumicino via Munich,Aug-19,3,4,4,,,4,4,yes,7, My recent flight to Rome was via Munich. On both flights service was friendly and a continental breakfast was served consisting of several small servings of differents items - ranging from ham to a small piece of smoked salmon and a sweet but no fruit. For such short flights they were quite acceptable. However Lufthansa should take in consideration not everybody does like or can eat breads with seeds. The piece of bread was already put on the plate without another choice. In Rome fast delivery of the luggage - less than 20 minutes.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Stuttgart to Frankfurt,Aug-19,2,1,,,,4,2,yes,4,"  Stuttgart to Frankfurt and Munich to Stuttgart there was no service offered. Not even glass of water. We boarded the flight on a hot day in August but no water offered. A few passengers had to ask the crew for a snack because it was time for medicine, to which crew offered a banana to them. Let me point out that tickets were not cheap. All in all, I did not feel value for money."

✅ Trip Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Marseille to Hong Kong via Munich,Aug-19,,,,,,1,1,no,1,"  Marseille to Hong Kong via Munich. Non existent service from Lufthansa. Completely inflexible procedure as the airline would not allow us to Fly from Marseille to Munich (the first leg of the flight we had booked) to find an alternative route following the shut down of Hong Kong Airport due to the protest. We were supposed to fly to Phuket the next day from Hong Kong so wanted to fly to Munich to find a way to from there to fly either to Phuket or to Bangkok, so we would not miss out on our holidays. The 'chef d'Escale' in Marseille told us that we could not board our flight even just to Munich and that she could not offer any other alternative solution. Lufthansa made us miss our flight letting us stranded in Marseille. We had no other option than to cancel our flight and book a last minute flight with another airline since that was not an option from Lufthansa. As a result we had to stay in Marseille for another 24 hours, rent a new car for the 24hours and arrange to stay another night for the 5 of us in Marseille."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Split,Sep-19,4,2,4,1,1,1,3,no,4,"  Frankfurt to Split. Basic standard flight. Boarding started only 5min before dep time, and at no point they had announced about any delay for the flight. Boarding at the gate was a real hassle too when people tried to cram to the gate too early. Entrance to the aircraft (A321) was made via two front doors with business pax having nicely their own entry. In the end we were 35 mins behind schedule in destination. Cold meal served during the 1hr flight and it was rather small but OK. No IFE. No free wifi in business class. Cabin crew seemed uninterested in their duties and a female pax in business class was talking to her phone even while taxiing and she ended that just a short moment before takeoff. Crew did not intervene even though walked past her a few times. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Business Class,Helsinki to Frankfurt,Sep-19,4,5,1,1,1,3,2,no,1,"  Helsinki to Frankfurt. Below par business class product. Checkin and boarding easy but meal service onboard was incredibly poorly laid out. Hot meal served from a small tray with plastic dining utensils, meals in foil and plastic boxes giving the impression of economy class. Wifi was not free  in business class. Sparkling wine was not real champagne. SAS Lounge used at Helsinki is very basic, 2/5, but near departure gate. Purser was happy and cheerful and overall flight was good but very much below what this class should offer (all the little things that make it were totally absent)."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Marseille,Aug-19,2,3,3,,,2,3,yes,4,"  Frankfurt to Marseille. End of holidays in Europe. Boarding was extremely messy, with a lot of kids. As usual LH ground staff acted on a robotic way, with no empathy, resulting in protests from many passengers and 30 minutes delay on taking off. On our last 4 flights boarding has been stressful, no exception. This one, the last one, was the worse. It seems that staff is blind and deaf, operating computers and watching passengers flocking as if they were aliens. When non-priority passengers rush on priority lane, LH staff do not pre-check, and let them face a ""access denied"" message from the automatic gate. Then, they have to go back, blocking other pax. This is not working. LH has to think about it. Flight was quick, with no frills. 40 mn delayed."
,A340-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Cape Town to Frankfurt,Feb-19,4,3,3,5,3,2,4,yes,7,"Cape Town to Frankfurt. The flight was fully booked. We checked in at the counter were also Swiss and Austrian airlines would check in. Very unpolite staff at the counter, versus the one in the flight. It was a 12h hours flight almost, seating in economy class were actually very comfortable and very new, the entertainment was new and was working well, with a good selection of films and TV series. The food was good although the portions are very small, and the breakfast was a bit horrible served in the meaning of eggs without bread option and no other options. The staff is very polite, although there is often no emotions and they work just like robots."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 748,Business,Economy Class,Frankfurt to México,Sep-19,3,4,4,4,4,3,4,yes,8," Frankfurt to México. Modern plane with a very kind purser. Seats in eco are ok but 11h30min is too long for LH eco. However service offered was great with 2 hot and good meals, a snack in between and multiple drink services. Overall a good Economy product. Biggest disadvantage of LH currently is Airport Frankfurt. One of the worst airports in Europe."
Not Verified ,Boeing 747-8,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Washington to Frankfurt,Aug-19,3,4,5,3,3,3,5,yes,8,"  Check-in at IAD was quick, but not a smiley one. Rather rude indeed. LH Senator lounge was packed, with nice options of food and drinks. WI-FI was not able to handle 4 flights (Brussels/Austrian/SAS/LH) and therefore did not work. Boarding very quick. Flight went smoothly, with an excellent service from FA's, plus very delicate food, and a reasonable choice of drinks. Really nice. Unfortunately LH do not provide pyjamas in flights from US East Coast. When we requested one from Chief purse, he was polite however firm on the fact that on LH point of view this was NOT a long haul flight (albeit >8h). When kindly asking for a first class pyjama, as a gesture, we received a firm NO, with a slight unpleasant hint on the fact that we were not a Miles&More Gold, ""only"" a TAP Mlies&Go Star Alliance Gold member, as if there were a second class Gold members in Star Alliance. Unnecessary opinion from a LH chief purse. Maybe there are indeed second class Gold members in Star Alliance. Note 10/10 for welcome lounge in FRA that deserves the highest congratulations for its comfort and service."

We really really appreciate her service.
✅ Trip Verified ,A340,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Bogota to Frankfurt,Aug-19,3,1,1,4,,3,2,no,4,"  Bogota to Frankfurt. LH is not even close to 4 star.  Slow disembarking, we almost missed our connecting flight. I tried to explain it to the flight attendants, but they were rude and sharp to me. Service was 3 star for me. Seats are ok. Overall dissapinted."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Manchester to Barcelona via Frankfurt,Aug-19,5,5,4,,,4,3,yes,9,"  Manchester to Barcelona via Frankfurt. The lounge used at Manchester was the Aspire, adequate but not amazing. The seat had adequate room I'm 6 1 and there was a good 2 inches spare. I was in seat 2f. The cabin crew were friendly the meal was served quickly. There was no choice. It was chicken with pesto and fruit salad. Tasted better than it sounds. With a mousse for pudding. There are lots of lounges at Frankfurt so easy to choose one close to departure gate. Lots of nice food to choose from so had some spicy chicken and cake. The next flight was fine with another nice crew but the same meal which was disappointing. Both planes were late in boarding but made up the time in flight. Priority boarding was recognised and and my luggage came off early."
✅ Trip Verified ,Airbus,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Rome to Manchester via Frankfurt,Aug-19,5,5,5,,,5,5,yes,10,"  Rome to Manchester via Frankfurt. After being unable to reach the airport on time because of an accident on the road and missing our flight as a result, Lufthansa handled the situation very professionally and efficiently and reissued new flights so all stranded passengers can get home. It wasn't the airlines fault, it wasn't anyone's fault, just an unfortunate accident that caused complete gridlock outside the airport in Rome. But Lufthansa showed their human side and helped everyone get home while paying respect to the person that's lost their life on the road. We would like to thank the airline for being our saviours and recommend them highly as I am sure that very few airlines would have such human approach in such situations. Lufthansa is going to be our preferred choice from now on and they have our loyalty for life. Thank you!"
✅ Trip Verified ,A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Budapest to Frankfurt,Aug-19,4,5,3,,,5,4,yes,8," Budapest to Frankfurt. Very friendly and kind crew on a great new aircraft! Seats are nicely designed and reasonably comfortable, departed and arrived on time both sectors despite full flights, a very busy Frankfurt airport and remote stands both times in FRA. Snack on board was just a chocolate bar which was a little disappointing.. there's definitely not enough time for a hot meal but a sandwich or something would be nicer than chocolate. Drinks selection was very good with tea & coffee served despite some turbulence. Always pleased taking LH within Europe!"
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Krakow via Frankfurt,Aug-19,3,3,1,,,3,3,no,1,"  Dublin to Krakow via Frankfurt. I risked a transfer from KLM to Lufthansa. It was a mistake. They change the rules after purchasing a ticket and all complaints remain unanswered. It looks like this: you bought a ticket, we change the rules and you have a problem, not us. What will you do for us? First and last time, never again. I'm coming back to proven and reliable carriers."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Malpensa,Aug-19,4,5,3,,,4,4,yes,8," Frankfurt to Malpensa with Lufthansa. I wanted to thank the crew for their wonderful care and hospitality. My husband and I were away celebrating our 32nd wedding anniversary, the crew presented us with a bottle of champagne. It is my experience, that people often write to complain about something, but do not bother when something quiet wonderful and completely unexpected happens. I just wanted to say thank you! "
✅ Trip Verified ,,Business,Economy Class,Krakow to Palma via Munich,Aug-19,,,,,,1,1,no,2,  In transit in Munich. Am Frequent Traveller with LH. I had booked three award tickets to go on vacation. I went with my wife and my son to the LH business lounge and was denied the possibility to buy access for my wife and my son because they have tickets issued by LOT. I argued that I did not book nor choose LOT as the Award tickets were issued by Lufthansa when I booked the awards. What a shame.
✅ Trip Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to Rome via Frankfurt,Jul-19,3,2,3,3,,1,3,no,2,"  Los Angeles to Rome via Frankfurt. First my seat broke in the middle of the flight and cant be repaired, I have to stay in half sitting, half laying down position the rest of the flight. Well this may be just my bad luck, but the thing really make me disappointed is the the customer service. We gave our coats to the flight attendant to hang in the closet during the flight. Both the flight attendant and we have forgotten the coats when deboarding. Later we visited the baggage claim desk and they said cant find it, I sent a request to the customer service and got a response with a case number, but did not get any response for more than a month while I keep sending email trying to get any status. Only until I sent an personal email to the CEO than I got a response which in no surprise that they no longer can find the coats. In 21st century the customer service should be on the mind of every major company, Lufthansa essentially has none. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Munich to Valencia,Aug-19,2,4,1,,,3,1,no,1,"  Munich to Valencia. Outbound on A321, inbound on 320. Both planes new but with spartan equipment. No IFE, no overhead screen to follow the route. Security information done on old fashioned way by flight attendants. On outbound flight the seat recline did not work. Both flights over 30min late. With catering LH touched new low. 2hrs flight, 330€ for ticket without luggage and everything what the give to you is a chocolate cookie. A true 5 star airline. Well done Lufthansa."
Not Verified ,,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Casablanca to Frankfurt ,Aug-19,1,1,1,,,1,1,no,2,"  Casablanca to Frankfurt. The rudest crew I have ever encountered, but surely these people should be trained to service an international client base. No inflight entertainment, no pre-drinks service, uncomfortable seats, just terrible in every way. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Malta,Jan-19,1,4,1,1,,1,1,no,1,"  Frankfurt to Malta. It’s not a 5 star airline on a 2 hour flight, no hot meal served in business class and not even a vegetarian option. What is that you not even get a business class seat just a blocked middle seat."
NotVerified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Porto via Frankfurt,Aug-19,4,3,1,,1,4,1,no,2,"  My flights with Lufthansa from London to Porto via Frankfurt were a disappointment. Lufthansa currently has a problem with its catering agents - it seems that very little food is available on short-haul flights in Europe. This downgrades the flying experience to something like that of a budget airline. On the short flight from LHR to FRA passengers were given one biscuit. On the second flight from FRA to OPO we were given a chocolate bar. That's it. That was the extent of the food service on the 2 Lufthansa flights totalling more than 4 hours. Additionally, a 10-minute thunderstorm in the Frankfurt are was converted into an arrival delay of almost one hour. There was little in the way of apology from Lufthansa. The cabin crew seemed pleasant and polite enough but the overall experience was very disappointing and not something I expected from an airline with the reputation of Lufthansa."
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-400,Business,Business Class,Rio de Janeiro to Frankfurt,Jul-19,4,5,4,,,4,4,yes,8,"  Rio de Janeiro to Frankfurt on Lufthansa in Business Class. I had a very positive experience sitting on the upper deck of the B747-400, which - due to its size had a rather private feel. The seats were arranged in a 2-2 configuration, all extending to a fully flat bed. I had read mixed reviews about the seats before. Even though there are business class products which provide more privacy, I found the seats comfortable and got a good night of sleep. The food was decent even though it is better in my experience if you fly out of Frankfurt. However, what really made my flight was the impeccable service. I would be happy to fly Lufthansa again."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Budapest to Amsterdam via Frankfurt,Aug-19,4,3,2,1,,4,3,yes,7,"  Budapest to Amsterdam via Frankfurt. Again our flight to Frankfurt was delayed by 1 hour. Cabin crew friendly and seats were okay, however legroom on the a320 NEO is less then on the older A320's. Snack was again a small chocolate bar with a drink. Not really a 5 star experience, but okay."
✅ Trip Verified ,A333,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Boston to Frankfurt,Aug-19,1,1,1,1,,1,1,no,1,"  I just traveled with my 16 month old infant on August 5, 2019 from Boston to Frankfurt with Lufthansa. I have chosen this airline for many years as a family friendly airline and for its reputation. Unfortunately when I traveled this time it was a total disaster leading me to write this review. I consider myself a frequent flyer, having done this trip over twenty times but never with an infant. I have a multitude of complaints including complete disregard from crew and personnel, unsanitary conditions on the flight and rude service. I am extremely disappointed and will never choose this company again after paying $1700 for this roundtrip ticket. First, I paid extra for a special seat to accommodate my daughter and I and found myself in the middle row. I understand that I chose to have her in my lap as these were the only options given to me during booking. Secondly, the staff in economy was extremely rude and unaccommodating to our situation and even refused us a bottle of water. Thirdly, the conditions in the plane were a disgrace. People were throwing up in the aisle, multiple passengers had their bare feet on the seat rests and television monitors with no consideration for others and the crew did nothing to remedy this. I was horrified at the thought of changing my infants diaper in the bathroom under these conditions. Lastly, no one showed any consideration or patience while aware that I was carrying an infant, a stroller and two carry-ons while boarding and deplaning and no one offered a seat on the bus that brought us twice to two different terminals forcing us to stand and trying not to loose our balance. I understand that I am not in control of the behavior of others, but the crew showed complete indifference towards this and lacked complete empathy for the passengers on this flight and my daughter and I. I believe that the crew's lack of care reinforced an atmosphere of total indifference. I also want to add that in Boston at the check-in I was charged an extra $60 USD for my daughters check-in baggage. I had already paid for my one check-in back at the time of booking and was not expecting this additional charge."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Lisbon to Frankfurt,Aug-19,2,5,5,,5,5,5,yes,8,"  Lisbon to Frankfurt. It was a pleasant flight in an adequate quality. On the ground, the lounge (TAP Lounge) offered a good variety of Food and Drinks and queues at security were short. Boarding was efficient, delivering the advertised priority boarding. On board, soon after take off, a tasty warm meal was served. Crew was awesome, adressed me by name and came around frequently. Only issue was cleanliness of the aircraft. Carpets and toilet floors had obviously earned their money. Table at Bulkhead was sticky. Seating was economy standard, the limit for this flight time (2.5 h). Wifi worked at good speed, power outlets would be really useful.  Not a five star experience,but solid four stars. Got a cheap fare."
Not Verified ,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Vienna via Frankfurt,Aug-19,4,5,5,5,5,1,3,no,4,  Bumped from flight from JFK to Frankfurt in spite of arriving at gate on time. Sent to Frankfurt on later flight. Lost a half a day of vacation in Vienna. Well-compensated by Lufthansa for mistake. Allowed to use Lufthansa lounge. Was targeted by Frankfurt ground personnel for personal hand baggage weight and size before second flight to Vienna. Flights were good. Once on board with Lufthansa is great. Before boarding was a total disaster. The lines at check in at JFK are 3rd world like. They take hours. Extremely frustrating. They overbook and bump passengers. 
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Bologna to Frankfurt,Aug-19,2,3,1,,,5,2,no,5,  Bologna to Frankfurt. On board service poor and catering almost the same. Seating is normal but on a flight i had later from Thai smile in economy plus has been much better.
✅ Trip Verified ,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Budapest via Frankfurt,Jul-19,4,4,2,1,,3,3,yes,7,  Amsterdam to Budapest via Frankfurt. Flights were nothing special. Both flights slightly delayed and catering was only a drink and one twix that I found very disappointing.  Seat and legroom were good.
✅ Trip Verified ,Boeing 747-400,Business,Economy Class,Vancouver to Frankfurt,Apr-19,4,4,2,3,,4,4,yes,7,"  Vancouver to Frankfurt. A good, comfortable flight to Frankfurt. The flight took off on time and landed a few minutes early. The boarding process was orderly and the flight attendants were polite and attentive. I was quite satisfied with the flight. I wasnt too impressed with the vegetarian meals that i had pre-ordered. This was the only down side to this flight."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Izmir to Hamburg via Munich,Jul-19,3,1,1,,,1,1,no,1,"  The departure from Izmir was suppose at 3.40 am. Upon entering the plane, the pilot cautioned the pax that there might be some delay due to some maintenance work. An hour later he announced that a test could not be performed due to a missing tool, an hour later  a document needed to be signed my a maintenance manager in FRA to certify that the plane could fly without the test but the person could not be reached because he was sleeping. The flight was cancelled because the crew exceeded the maximum working time. LH does not have airport staff at Izmir airport. One person from the handling agent was trying to handle the 180 odd pax. It was chaos for at least 4h. She first gave a card with LH call center numbers and told us to make our own arrangements. I did that after 2h standing in an unruly mob, and I was put on a 11.30 flight, which they later changed (without my knowledge) to a 13.45 flight. I spent 13h at that dreadful airport. The flight was operated then by budget carrier Sun Express without any drinks or food. Drinks and sandwiches were offered at Izmir airport after 4h. I arrived Hamburg at 18.30 instead of 11 am. Never again LH."
✅ Trip Verified ,A321,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Lisbon,Jul-19,4,2,3,3,,2,2,no,4,"  Frankfurt to Lisbon. 01:30 delay. When I try to get on board, the ground staff told me that first were lots of people with big instruments, so they could be attached to the seats. I told I was business class passenger, and even so, she didn´t listen to me. After take off, cabin crew gave us the meals, served the drinks and then they went to Economy class. Business class were unattended for nearly 15 minutes. I spoke with the purser, and he told me that was Lufthansa´s procedure.  I think Lufthsana had a Business class service and ground service much better then now. Not anymore."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Madrid,Jul-19,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  Copenhagen to Madrid. One of the worst flight experiences. I was supposed to fly with Lufthansa from Copenhagen to Madrid, but due to a delay on a connecting flight, I never arrived to Copenhagen and made it to my flight, I was therefore forced to rebook my flight ticket with another company to arrive to my final destination. The problem arises three days later when I had to check in to my return flight with Lufthansa, my return flight ticket has been canceled without noticing me, since I did not board the outgoing flight from Copenhagen. They canceled my return ticket without even informing me. This meant that I had to look for a new flight less than 24 hours of my departure. "
✅ Trip Verified ,A340-300,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Frankfurt to San Diego,Jul-19,1,1,1,5,,4,3,no,2,"  Frankfurt to San Diego. This is my second dreadful flight on this route. Lufthansa flies old A340's in service for 22+ years, and their age, wear and tear show. The seats are frayed and torn, and cushions hard and in need of replacing. The food borders on inedible for me. The staff were very senior which is not bad, but some appear indifferent. I would describe the service as grudgingly pleasant bordering on not-caring. The pluses are a great IFE system, punctuality, nice touches like a pillow and blanket for each seat, a clean aircraft and complementary drinks. These little pluses are far overshadowed by its negatives. This is my fifth LH flight in the past 15 months. This may be my last."
✅ Trip Verified ,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London  to St Petersburg via Munich,Jul-19,,,,,,,1,no,1,"  London to St Petersburg via Munich. Terrible booking experience with Lufthansa. I made a mistake while booking a ticket and booked for one day earlier. Refused to help, gave me no options at all."
✅ Trip Verified ,A320 / Boeing 747-8,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Los Angeles via Frankfurt,Jul-19,1,2,1,1,1,2,2,no,2,"  Copenhagen to Los Angeles via Frankfurt. I have found Lufthansa becoming more and inconsistent in their performance. On the first leg, we had secured nice exit seats with plenty of leg space, to be told at the gate that we had instead been upgraded to business class. However, this is is the first time in 25 years of travel that I get an upgrade, and the service offering is a down-grade. First off, the seat pitch is less than in economy class (compared to the exit seats we had). Then, it turns out that there is not enough business class catering, so  we each get a KitKat snack to keep us happy. Suffice to say that If I can afford to pay more than 1000 USD for a ticket, I can afford to buy an unhealthy snack for 50 cents. The purser expressed that she was ""sorry"". I acknowledge her statement, but I would much more appreciate her fixing the problem. The long-haul portion of the trip was average. The IFE and power supply did not work for me and the people sitting next to me, and it took the crew hours to figure this out. I had ordered Lufthansa's a la carte dining, which has been very good in the past. Today, parts of the meal were very unattractive. I cannot believe that they have the heart to charge 30 EUR for a rip-off of this sort. A final observation from the long-haul part was that we spent almost an hour holding at the tarmac at LAX, after landing, before finally arriving at our gate This was handled very poorly by the cabin team. I was for instance able to get off the plane before almost all premium passengers. In conclusion, not Lufthansa's finest day, by far. Would I fly them again? Perhaps, but they would not be my first choice, and they are not a five-star airline."
