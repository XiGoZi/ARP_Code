review,real_sentiment
 Had not flown EasyJet for over a year because of constant delays (and flights cancelled). Tried the airline again with a morning flight to Bordeaux which was close to 2 hours late. This company has no respect whatsoever for their clients. I will definitely not use easyJet again!,negative
"   Given the basic fare cost with no hold baggage, speedy boarding etc. they provide a poor level of service in all respects. Return flight delayed by well over an hour with no information from them other than gate to be announced. Then a pathetic excuse about an earlier fight delay elsewhere that shows they have no slack in their operations. A pathetic service from a pathetic airline of what has to be the airline of the last resort when no other options exist to travel. The rating of 1 star is not deserved but it will not register zero.",negative
" My EasyJet flights from Oporto to Ajaccio were generally positive, with a couple of minor bumps. The flights themselves were comfortable and on time, except for a one-hour delay on the connecting flight from Geneva to Oporto. Unfortunately, there weren't any announcements from the ground staff about the delay, which was frustrating. Be wary of the duty-free offers. They advertise big savings compared to high street stores, but I found the same perfumes significantly cheaper (around 5 euros less) in shops on the main street.",positive
"? ?EasyJet are scammers. We were never informed of their monetise the baggage policy, until we arrived at the boarding gate, and could no longer transfer stuff into hold cases. My 76 year old wife was charged ?48 because her cabin bag, which she has used for years and years had become 1"" too long, because Easy Jet decided to cash in by making a new ""rule"". They have done this, knowing full well, and in complete contravention, of the decision by the European Parliament's Committee, to now enforce a cabin baggage rule made in 2014. The European Court of Justice refers to airlines' varied size and weight standards for hand baggage, hidden fees, and misleading consumers about the true cost of air travel. The explanation given, was that the bag was a flight safety hazard, in the event of the aircraft being evacuated. However, by paying Easy Jet ?48, the bag was no longer a flight safety hazard, apparently. The other explanation given was that it would not go under the seat, but would have to go in the overhead lockers, designed for that purpose. Which, of course, was exactly what always happened before Easy Jet changed their rules. Incongruously, prior to take off, cabin crew (quite correctly) ask for any significant items to be stored in the overhead locker. Now, if that isn't misleading and monetising customers, then I don't know what is. Easy Jet may seem like a cheap option. It isn't. If you have a problem, and there are often problems travelling, Easy Jet will do nothing to help you. Better, much better, simply fly with a reputable airline. Superficially, it might appear a few pounds more; but, when you need customer service, you are much more likely to get it.",negative
"  I have been travelling for 5 years, between Hurghada/Gatwick, approx 7 - 8 times per year. I am sick to death of this airline, but unfortunately have no other option of another direct flight, since WizzAir stopped their flights. I need wheelchair assistance which I always book in advance, yet, I am never provided with the service they claim they can provide. The wheelchairs provided in Hurghada airport are all broken & on arrival 3 weeks ago, I was dumped on a seat at the far end of the arrivals corridor & completely abandoned for 35 minutes, until the pilot & crew came past & asked if I was OK. I explained the situation & they kindly went to find a porter with another wheelchair to rescue me. The porters always demand a tip & often rummage through my purse, dictating to me which notes they will take for this 'free special assistance service', whilst also asking me for some of my painkillers, pens, sweets etc. The porters only provide a wheelchair service after you have queued to get into the airport, queued to have your passport check, queued to get through the first x-ray & bag/body searches, 2nd bag search & checked your bags in. They only wheel you to the gate, not down the gangways to the plane, so you are left standing in queues to board the plane for 30 - 45 minutes. My flight back from Hurghada on Sunday 26th May was delayed for over 26 hours & absolutely no special assistance was provided at all to disembark the plane, when the pilot decided to abort take off. I was left to struggle all the way back through the airport again & onto a bus which drove us all the way out to a hotel in Sahl Hasheesh, then struggle to offload my luggage from the bus & in the pitch black, at 4am, all round the huge hotel complex, to my room. No Easyjet rep made an appearance & I only knew when the bus was coming to pick us up to take us back to the airport, through rumours from other passengers. It is also infuriating that on every flight back to the UK from Hurghada, they never have any food. Only 7/10 flights to Hurghada have food available. I am diabetic & had arrived at Hurghada Airport at 6pm for my 8.45pm flight on Sunday. The 1st delay was apparently due to the plane arriving late from the UK. The 2nd delay was apparently due to a crew member being sick & the 3rd delay, was due to a technical issue with 2 of the 3 plane's communication systems as we were taking off. We were all sat on the plane, on the runway for over 2 hours, with no food or drink, only half a plastic cup of warm tap water each. We reached the hotel we were bussed to at approx 3.15am, but there was no food or drink available. All the restaurants were shut. The first opportunity to drink anything was from the minibar at 4.45am, once I had struggled alone to my room. Still, no food had been provided at all. I was feeling extremely unwell by then & tried to call Reception using the phone in the room, but it was broken. The next thing I remember was waking up at about 12.10pm. I struggled to get up & outside to try to find something to eat. Luckily, I came across a fellow passenger who escorted me to a restaurant for lunch. It was the fellow passenger who told me where the nearest pharmacy was & the rumour she had heard about a bus picking us up at 6pm. Arrived at the airport for our 10pm flight, which was delayed until 11pm. Again, no food on the flight. The excuses for flight delays are usually; pilot stuck on M25, crew sick, plane late in, technical issues, etc.",negative
" I recently flew with easyJet, and overall, the experience was very good. The flight itself was comfortable, the crew was friendly and attentive, and the onboard services met my expectations. However, there was a significant delay that affected my travel plans. Despite this, the airline handled the situation professionally and provided timely updates. While the delay was inconvenient, the quality of the service and the positive attitude of the staff helped mitigate the frustration. I would recommend easyJet but advise future travelers to be prepared for potential delays.",positive
" Horrible experience, I will never book with them again. Very unprofessional and incompatible staff. This company is only interested to take money from people. I highly recommend to avoid flying with this company if possible, their services are absolutely below minimum.",negative
"  Differently from previous flight boarding process was stressless. Once again extremely pleasant staff. Two pax decided to deboard, for private reasons. Staff reacted quickly and flight was not delayed thanks to their ability to deal with their hand and registered luggage.",positive
"  Perfect check-in, with no stress. Boarding on the other hand was rather disorganized, as after checking our boarding passes, we were parked in a too small room, not fitted for so many passengers, and only a couple of seats. Plane extremely clean with an extreme friendly staff. Even not a free cup of water was offered. But I was choked by the repeated announcements on selling alcoholic drinks at cheap price. Disembarking in Porto under strong rain, no finger, no bus, not even a protected ladder. We arrived completely wet at terminal after a 200 meters walk.",neutral
   I normally only leave a review if I have something positive to say. On this flight there is no positive except being transported from AYT to EDI. I honestly can't remember the last time I was on a flight with such a disinterested lazy crew. They did one service after take off at break neck speed then disappeared. Apparently they were having dinner! How long it takes to have a ping dinner and a coffee appears to be at least 2hrs 30mins. They were visible individually when they took it in turns to make the long journey from the aft galley to the front galley only to sit down and read a book. Their attitude was quite unbelievable. If I had to base EZY on this flight alone I'd never step foot on one of their aircraft again. Not that they'd be bothered given their management don't appear to take any comments onboard.,negative
"   easyJet failed to reimburse me so I paid for baggage twice! easyJet should be ashamed of themselves. Happy to pocket customers money for their mistakes. You may think that ?60 doesn't matter for being duped into paying for an extra bag through your faulty app, however my one way flight (including baggage) came to approx ?270 so an additional payment of ?60 through the app equates to a 20% overpayment into your pocket.  But the principal stands. I'm a frequent traveller and use many airline apps. And that's why I know what you are doing is wrong. After taking the time to raise this issue with easyJet, twice, and after easyJet failed to reimburse me, I'm going to take it upon myself to try and raise awareness because there certainly is an integrity issue on your part.",negative
"  EasyJet is not easy to Travel. I am non EU citizen living in Europe since 7-8 years. Travelled with few more airlines inside Europe. EasyJet was not easy this time. My boarding, passport and visa permit was taken long time to verify and they find the reason on my hand carry to not let pass. Was forced to pay extra 48 euro due to the wheel of the carry the size was not fitted according to their requirements.  While I was inside the plane and saw similar types of hand carry and surprisingly was allowed without extra fee. ",negative
" The cabin bag size check at the boarding gate is smaller than the requirements stated on the website, so many people are stopped and made to pay for bags that are supposedly therefore too big! I always carry and tape measure and measured the box, 2cm smaller all round!",negative
"? ?Paris to Milano 4th April 2024 on a newish A320. Ticket not cheap. EasyJet has very restrictive luggage requirements, particular the minuscules dimensions permitted. In CDG Airport, the Terminal D is quite remote; it took me an hour to get there properly from T1, including busses, several passport, BP, and security checks, makes transit in Paris a hassle. Requirements for EasyJet to board early and check in baggage VERY early is, unnecessarily, very strict and scares people to waste a lot of time by being in gate area by far too early. Flight was delayed 1 hour. Information provided was sparse and unclear. Delays of ? to 1 hour is more common on this route by easyJet. Onboard staff professional, announcements were good, provided by a Danish pilot called Andersen. Seats are bolstered, good, but can¡¯t recline. Catering onboard expensive. But altogether somehow OK. Will not refuse to fly Easyjet again.",neutral
"  Clean Aircraft, comfortable seats, superb flight attendants. The flying experience was excellent and the service was friendly and cordial. Cabin Crew was excellent in their appearance and duties. The updates from the Pilot and First Officer were frequent and helpful. The bag drop process was automated at LGW, but through a sultry human agent at LCA. In LGW during boarding a member of the ground staff immediately took out the POS machine to charge &48 per cabin bag, even though it did conform to their tight frame contraption. So without checking the bags, she tried to grab ?48 per passenger. I think that easyJet has to look into this. In the end we were not charged as our bags did fit within their strict frame. Apart from their greedy extra charges for hand baggage attempt, I would say that easyJet is very very good. Two flights in March 2024 LCA-LGW and LGW-LCA in A320s with winglets (G-EJCV and G-EJCR) Will fly with easyJet again.",positive
"  Horrible experience. We were forced to pay 48 pounds each for the backpacks which, surprisingly, had come perfectly packed on the outbound flight to Edinburgh. The height of ridiculousness was on the plane, after paying because the backpack supposedly didn't fit under the seat, the flight attendant told me that I had to put it under the seat and I couldn't use the cabin. When asked why I had to pay, I couldn't answer. A shame and an abuse to go get money at no cost. Experi¨ºncia horr¨ªvel. Fomos obrigados a pagar 48 libras cada pelas mochilas que, pasme-se, tinham vindo perfeitamente acondicionadas no voo de ida para Edimburgo. O c¨²mulo do rid¨ªculo foi dentro do avi?o, depois de pagar porque supostamente a mochila n?o cabia debaixo do assento, a comiss¨¢ria de bordo me dizer que a tinha que p?r debaixo do assento e n?o podia usar a cabine. Quando questionada sobre o porqu¨º de ter tido que pagar, n?o me soube responder. Uma vergonha e um abuso para irem buscar dinheiro a custa de nada.",negative
" Very bad experience. Don't go with this company, you will regret. We were charged for extra baggage on the gate just to hear the gate is already closed. Great, and guess what, they don't want to refund us the money for the extra bag. Really not worth it to bother with them, rather pay a little extra for a reliable airline and don't be treated like this.",negative
 Hangry! Do not rely on having food. We pre-booked food vouchers (T&Cs: non-transferable or refundable) for our return flight but apparently only the half the food supplies were loaded at Gatwick which the outbound passengers ate almost all of. So there were no hot meals or sandwiches left by the time they reached us in row 6 on the return flight. Surely if we commit to purchasing food on board then EasyJet should commit to having some available or at least sending an email when plane left Gatwick so we could purchase at airport. Got the price of the voucher back but no compensation for going 12 hours without food. Also embarrassed by Gatwick staff at gate concerning a medical bag and seats have very little leg room.,negative
"  Basic but good. Flying frequently with so called legacy carriers occasionally I opt for easyJet when times and prices work out and I am always pleased with my choice. This time Nice to Berlin and all was perfect. Boarding well organized, on time departure, crew active in helping (other) passengers to stow their luggage, arrival ahead of scheduled. Luggage on belt when we reached it. It was the best choice we could make for this route, day and occasion. Thank you!",positive
"  I recently flew from Luton to Alicante on January 30th, 2024, on flight EZY2315 (departure time: 15:25). While I appreciate the efficiency of easyJet, I feel compelled to share a concerning experience related to the boarding process. As one of the first passengers at the gate, I observed an easyJet employee who appeared to be responsible for ensuring compliance with luggage policies. Unfortunately, his approach was marked by a level of rudeness that was quite disconcerting. Whether due to a language barrier or personal demeanour, the tone, body language, and facial expressions used towards passengers were far from the expected standards of customer service. I believe in easyJet's commitment to providing a positive travel experience, and I hope this feedback contributes to maintaining those high standards.",neutral
"  Outrageous return price from Glasgow to Stansted. Delayed out of Glasgow No information given. No staff at the gate until after the departure time. Got on and off the flight without as much as a hello. Crew just looked straight through customers as they got on and off. Dirty, dated cabin. Enough to deter you from eating or drinking on board. Tray table sticky. On my way home today (one week later). Can't check in early apparently. Be warned there are no seats if this happens and none of the the phone charging points worked on the day. If you have your boarding pass on your phone you're in trouble. This is my first and last easyJet flight. Definitely not budget prices. BA business class would have cost less. Flying used to be fun but with easyJet it was an ugly, stressful unpleasant experience. From my experience everything about them is just cheap. From my experience definitely not budget prices. They won't be seeing me again on their tired looking aircraft with cabin crew to match.",negative
"  Travelled with Easyjet on the 22/12/23 to go home for Christmas from Luton to Paris CDG. My suitcase was lost then located in Luton, allegedly sent on the next flight and finally found still in London. I never had any update from Easyjet and i have tried to contact them everyday since the 22nd. My suitcase contained Christmas presents for my kids alongside my treatment to prevent my seizures. I have now been off my treatment for 8 days (i¡¯m supposed to take it everyday) I¡¯m flying back to London tomorrow and will probably pick up my suitcase where i left it 9 days ago. Worst experience ever",negative
"  Great experience from start to finish. Staff were kind and helpful, both on the ground and in the air. Flight took off broadly on time and landed slightly early. Good service in the air; the cabin crew were efficient to get through the full cabin twice with the trolley.",positive
"  Busy flight, very full which led to a slow boarding process. However, the cabin crew worked hard to help people settle down and find space for the cabin baggage so that we could depart on time. Flight was smooth overall. Happy to use them again and would recommend to others.",positive
"  Flew with EasyJet on flight EJU8629 from Gatwick to Berlin on Sunday 17th December. The flight was perfectly adequate, with the boarding and departure from Gatwick being fine. On arrival in Berlin, is where it fell apart. On arrival at a remote gate, firstly we had to wait over 10 minutes for steps to arrive, and then a further 5 minutes for a bus to arrive to take us to the terminal. Cabin made light of the fact, that they have come to expect this at Berlins new airport. Frankly, if I was paying service fees to the airport, I would be kicking off about the lack of service provided. As a customer, it would put me flying into Berlin with EasyJet into Berlin (flew into Berlin in September with BA and though then had a gate straight away, had to wait 90 minutes for baggie to arrive). Thumbs up for the flight but thumbs down for the service at the airport.",positive
" Another great flight with easyJet. Check-in well organised with separate Pluscard desk. Security busy but plenty of lanes open. Boarding well organised with short wait on aircraft being prepared, buses to aircraft from terminal. Warm and welcoming crew onboard. Good selection of fresh options and drinks available, lights put on dim to allow passengers to rest which was good. Decent legroom onboard these easyJet aircraft. Clear announcements from both flight deck and cabin crew. Buses on arrival into Glasgow and immigration was quick and bags on carousel within 5-10 minutes. Always my first choice when flying.",positive
" The flight departed almost 3 hours late, apparently due to fog in Lisbon, then changed to traffic restrictions. Operations shouldn't exist when airports simply can't handle it. One of the cabin crew was rather nervous and stressed out which didn't help, due to the delay passengers get off the plane, then crew needed to check bags one by one with passengers. Everything done professionally but very troublesome. On arrival buses also arrived late.",negative
"? ?Flight landed on-time despite late departure. Boarding was too early, so we had to wait in line until arriving passengers disembarked. Cabin crew was friendly. Clean airplane. Simple flight, nothing extra.",positive
"  Flight delayed for 40 minutes, boarding started and we had to wait in the bus until the crew prepared the aircraft. Slim seats, with extra-payment for larger leg-space seats. Catering only for extra fee - no cash accepted, only card. No inflight entertainment, no device-charging possibility. A low-cost flight which fulfilled it¡¯s job.",neutral
"  Awful! Flew from Berlin on 26/11/23. After purchasing hold storage space, was told by extremely rude check in staff, that my cabin sized bag was too big and charged €58, despite it fitting in bag measurements guide. Beware! They scam people by including small cabin bags, but have exorbitant charge for having a ¡°large¡± cabin bag. If you don¡¯t travel often you may fall fowl of this scam. Flight was also delayed, I will never use again.",negative
"? ?Great experience. Baggage drop was quick, boarding was smooth (speedy boarding was honoured), flight departed on time and landed slightly ahead of schedule. Onboard service was efficient and all staff were friendly (ground staff and cabin crew). Couldn't have asked for more, especially given the great price for the ticket. Looking forward to my next flight with them.",positive
"  Easy baggage drop at Gatwick but boarding was disorganised. Onboard service was good and flight arrived on time. Seat was cramped and no space for bulkhead passengers to put hand luggage in overhead compartments nearby, so had to store them many rows behind!",neutral
"  Terrible airline with horrible online customer service. My flight from Milan to Prague itself was fine, but it was the issue I encountered a week beforehand which will be the reason I would never fly with Easyjet ever again. I was forced to cancel my flight from Naples to Athens due to an injury I sustained whilst on my European vacation. This flight was not refunded to me despite having purchased their travel insurance they offer when buying plane tickets on their website. When I made the claim they informed me that in the fine print of their terms and conditions, this travel insurance is only valid for Italian citizens. So essentially they sold me a service that they knew would not be valid if claimed by any international travellers. This sort of deceptive business tactics shows nothing less of the poor ethics this company has towards its customers.",negative
" Never fly with easyJet. Horrible customer service in Lisbon. They close their gates 1hr before flight time. So in order to make your flight on time please arrive 3hrs before your departure time. Missed our flight and lady at ticket office was charging us about $300 to put us on the next flight including our luggage price. I told her it¡¯s too expensive so she advised to look online and book another flight. So that¡¯s what I did since it was cheaper and better timing. I arrived to Barcelona to claim my luggage from my missed flight ¡ª turns out my luggage was still in Lisbon. Unbelievable. Nice guy in Barcelona did help. Everyone at Lisbon, at least 4 different customer agents did not help at all.",negative
"  Outbound flight from Glasgow to Faro on 21/10.23 was about 15 minutes late but not noticeable, uneventful flight apart from a young child continually kicking the back of my seat and a parent who didn't know how to parent. Arrived early. Crew seemed upbeat and friendly. Return flight from Faro to Glasgow 28/10/23 was a different story. Faro was a disaster. Check in/baggage drop was at the very far end of the check in desks and was queued out the door. 1 person manning the desk. Eventually someone else appeared then the check in changed to Glasgow and Belfast with just 2 people manning it. The queue by this stage was crazy. Eventually they opened up more desks but took nearly an hour to drop off bags. Next was security, queued out again with only a few channels open. Took a further 25 mins to get through this. Then passport control, once again queued out with only a couple of desks open. I suspect had our hotel transfer not been early we could have easily missed the flight as we only ha a short time after arriving at the gate before boarding started. Flight was ok, apart from the usual lack of legroom and again, though departing a bit late, arrived early at Glasgow. Easyjet was ok but Faro Airport was a nightmare.",neutral

" During flight EZY8035, the 16.35 from Gatwick to Tenerife South on 18th July 2023, the seat (about 13c) of my son was given to another passenger. My son is a full-fare paying passenger (although less than 16 so I am writing this on their behalf). After boarding and takeoff as normal, the seat was momentarily vacated. A passenger in the same row lay down and started to occupy the seat. Neither my son nor I were asked for consent or even informed of this action. All I could tell was a passenger who looked as though they were recovering from a heavy night and wanted a lie down to recover. To enable this, my son had to sacrifice their seat for an indefinite length of time. I raised my issue with the aircrew. My concern was passed between two cabin crew and escalated to their superior. I was told that as I'd momentarily vacated, I had to maintain this status quo and sacrifice my son's seat. No alternative was offered. No timeframe was given. The only option I was presented was for both my son and I to squeeze into the same seat. It transpired the situation lasted for the majority of the flight. The FAA states ""The safest place for your child ... is not in your lap"". Yet this is the situation I found myself in and had to try to explain to my son. When I escalated my concerns, the best the senior cabin crew could offer was advice I should write to customer services and request a refund for my son's seat. I followed this advice. Easyjet has offered no refund at all and closed the case.",negative
"  A very mixed bag. As a party of 4 we each booked and paid for 15kg hold luggage, before departure, I received an email saying we had 23kg. 3 of us had about 10kg and one went for 23kg. bag drop at Bristol was exemplary, machines worked well and helpful staff on standby to assist - no mention of extra fee. Bordeaux departure was mess, it says Billi L on the boarding pass, but who would know that that meant a shed at the end of the main terminal that was for low cost airlines - all the Departures signage coming from the hire car drop zone is to the main terminal in the opposite direction. At bag drop there was initially only 1 person sitting at a desk who was more interested in talking to colleagues rather than check in passengers' luggage. Then 2 more arrived and a panic to pull forward passengers travelling to Palma and Marseilles. The last member of our party was charged 45 euros for excess baggage despite having the same baggage as on the outbound flight. The rest of the boarding procedure was an equally overcrowded, hot and unpleasant experience. Why not use the main terminal, especially now it is about empty following France's partial domestic flight ban. Low visibility at Bristol resulted in an aborted landing followed by diversion to Cardiff. The crew were excellent, they kept us informed throughout, the captain stood at the front of the cabin and gave updates directly. The weather in Bristol cleared, they refuelled and got us there a little 2 hours late, well handled.",positive
"  I have flown with easyJet several times in previous years, but this time I had the unfortunate experience of learning about their handling of flight cancellations. First, I should note that the easyJet terminal at Schipol Airport is separate from all other airlines and has inadequate seating and very limited services. My flight from Amsterdam to Naples was canceled about 30 mins before the departure time, without any prior notice whatsoever that there might be any problems. There were no easyJet staff available to explain what to do. Asking other passengers with previous experience of easyJet cancellations was the only option. I went to the easyJet desk in the baggage claim area but the staff did nothing to help the stranded passengers. Recovering my checked package took 2 hours. After a long delay, the easyJet app offered the option to rebook on another flight, but in fact there were no other flights to Naples, Rome or Milan during the following two days. Compared to my experience with other airlines in similar situations, this was absolutely the worst.",negative
" Pretty poor performance by easyJet at their ¡°focus city¡± of Naples. Whilst bag-drop was straightforward and easy, getting through passport control was a total nightmare. At least a couple of hundred passengers were trying to reach the immigration booths at the B gates but were prevented by doing so by temporary barriers erected ostensibly to control the crowds but which instead resulted in passengers being kettled and trapped in scary conditions (i.e. risk of being crushed and little to no working air conditioning). One could argue this is the airport¡¯s responsibility rather than the airlines¡¯, but both Ryanair and jet2 sent their staff to the barriers to allow ONLY their passengers past the barriers; easyJet passengers were not allowed through and had to wait for other airline passengers to pass through and then slip through behind them whenever they could. EasyJet did not send down any staff to advocate for their passengers stuck behind the barriers and it was the most chaotic crowd I have ever seen waiting to be stamped out of any country. As a result, our flight was delayed by one hour simply because half of the passengers were still waiting to clear passport control (I overheard one of the ground staff confirm this to the cabin crew after I had been able to finally board). The flight itself was fine, but the experience at Naples airport was harrowing and it was upsetting to see how other low cost airlines bothered to get their passengers passed the barrier whilst easyJet staff were nowhere to be seen.",negative
"  Absolutely terrible. From start to end the experience with them is as awful as it can be.  First, buying a ticket is full of pop ups and weird advertising jumping in your way; glitches and more glitches; their boarding is always last minute; at the entry in the lounge you see the fed up, grumpy, not well-mannered staff; the staff always try to find something on you to charge you extra. On my last trip there's this staff member in LGW, not very presentable, checking the boarding passes - he asked many travellers to insert their baggage in a tiny space to verify the measurements; if it was half an inch bigger than that, then he tells the travellers that would be ?48 extra charge.  The only pleasurable person so far was the pilot, could see and hear his positiveness; he was assisting a little the staff in the flight to do their duties; then he apologised to us that he cannot do that anymore as he's got a plane to fly.",negative
 Early departure from Glasgow. Boarding well organised with Speedy boarding first. Aircraft¡¯s was clean and onboard crew were very professional and welcoming. Some passengers boarded last and kicked up a fuss about bags being further back in the cabin but this was handled very professionally from the cabin crew. Aircraft left a few minutes late due to a slot. Great service provided onboard and clear announcements made from the pilots about route and arrival time. Buses used in Berlin to take us to the terminal and passed through passport control in a few minutes. Bags waiting on belt when we got through. Another great flight and service from easyJet on the ground and in the air.,positive

" From my understanding I booked a flight from Berlin to Milan the day before yesterday. Afterwards I received a confirmation email saying the flight departs in Prague and flies to Milan. After I saw that email I immediately called EasyJet's customer service which was more useless. First he told me that there are no flights from Berlin to Milan at all and that I cannot change my flights at all. When I advised him that the airport is called Milan LIN that EasyJet planes fly to from Berlin, he told me that it would be cheaper for me to just make a new booking as it would be cheaper. However, I would still have to pay for those wrong flights from and to Prague since the booking has been made more than 24 hours ago. I asked him if there are any exceptions because obviously there must be a mistake (and it's possible that this mistake was made by the airline, because why would I book a flight from Prague) but he told me there's nothing that he can do for me. I went online and changed the flights on the website myself. There is no option to change both flights (there and return) at the same time, so I had to pay rebooking fees twice. Moreover there were no suitable return flights available anymore that leave in the evening, so now I had to take one a day later and have to pay for another night at the hotel. All in total I've paid now close to $900 AUD for flights + extra night at the hotel in Milan for one short trip from Berlin to Milan and return, because most likely there is some sort of bug in the system (either skyscanner or easyjet). This is more than frustrating! I would have expected EasyJet to show some understanding for my situation and either let me cancel the wrong booking to find another airline that offers me the right flights at the right times or let me change the flights at no extra fees.",negative
"  EasyJet has zero customer service. This is the second time that I have an unacceptable experience from EasyJet. I added a bag to my trip, paid for the bag, and now I need a simple receipt so that I can get reimbursed by my company. EasyJet is absolutely incapable of providing me with a receipt. I have contacted EasyJet 5 times and they have sent me receipts for my flights, but somehow they have zero financial proof that I added a bag, which means I will not get reimbursed by my company and the charge on my credit card apparently connects to nothing. How are they so incompetent? I've had multiple bad experienced, so I'm done. The cost is not worth the hassle.",negative
" Overall good trip. Baggage drop was quick and easy and staff were friendly. Poor boarding management at Luton airport, however. Boarding was via stairs and those allocated to board at the rear of the plane boarded as normal whereas those allocated to board via the front stairs were made to queue for around 15 to 20 minutes, standing on the tarmac. Later I discovered by chance that this was to allow a disabled passenger to be loaded first. This is understandable (and I don't mind waiting for that reason) but the failing of easyJet was that they did not communicate this reason to us whilst we were standing in the queue, not knowing what was going on. Luckily the weather was good outside. During the flight, crew worked hard and service was good despite the plane being full.",neutral
"  Our flight was caught up in the delays caused by the UK air traffic control failure. EasyJet's app was very good in keeping us up to date with the latest status / estimated times of the flight. The app alerted me to potential problems about 5 hours before the flight, when the air traffic control failure first began impacting flights. At one point it seemed as if we might be 4 hours delayed but in the end we were less than 90 minutes delayed, which was good considering how many other hundreds of flights were cancelled and thousands delayed. We were told to check-in at the usual time; there was no queue at the airport for baggage drop. Staff were friendly, though no explicit mention was made of the likely delays! Boarding was a little chaotic as it required buses to transport everyone from the terminal to the aircraft (so anyone with speedy boarding would have only have had a marginal advantage, if any). At this stage we were all just happy the flight was still going ahead. The flight was full and the staff worked hard providing the trolley service twice during the flight, despite turbulence.",positive
" My flight was delayed for almost 3 hours. It wasn't 3 hours was more like 2 hours and half. It almost feels on purpose. This is being constantly happening with my easyjet flights and I'm growing tired, it was the third easyjet flight out of 4 flights this year! But this one just was crazy. It made me loose all the possibility of city connections so I had to take a cab that cost me 70 pounds and took me 2 hours to get. Yet they don't take any responsibility. Enough! Easyjet no more, I prefer to pay 20-50 € more to go on any other company that to ever use you again.",negative
"  Nightmare with a scam airline. Sitting in the Plane from CFU-BER flight was delayed and could not go to Berlin instead to Rome FCO. In Rome Hotel and lost 1 day of work and lost my connection and had to rebook. I had to spend the night in Rome, lost my international connection for the next day and had to pay for booking another leg one way back to USA.  The next day the new flight to BER was delayed again so we made it to Berlin around 8pm and that is a delay of 20 hours. I had to rebook the hotel and flight and was able to fly back to Houston the next day with United. Besides the misery 1 workday lost and expenses to rebook flights and hotel I'm still not entitled for compensation or refund? I will not go into more details about the communication or information in CFU, FCU. Passengers had to run around trying to get any news of info themselves. The financial burden, the 2 day stressful journey and more than 24 hours delay does not entitle me to European Law refunds? I gave up after hours with EasyJet costumer service on the phone and. via email. The conversations were unpleasent and rude with the goal not to issue any refund.",negative

" Plane was clean, flight attendants were friendly but unobtrusive and the tickets were cheap as can be reasonably hoped for. Leg room was pretty much as expected and a bit of a tight squeeze but it was tolerable given the short flight time of an hour and a half. There were slight delays of about 15/20 minutes but nothing that was particularly notable. It was my first experience with easyJet and I flew without check in luggage and didn¡¯t pre select my seat. My experience was decent enough and noticeably much better than the only real alternative on this route which is to use BA which has always been an absolute endurance test any time I¡¯ve had the misfortune to fly with them. No issues at all and I¡¯ll happily use easyJet again in the future.",positive
 Most awful experience ever. Flight delayed to next day and keeps being delayed when any other company is safely landing at my destination. Never again easyJet,negative
"  Horrible experience with easyJet. 3 hours before our flight we get an SMS that the flight was cancelled. No ground staff offered any assistance or information The only way to find an alternative flight was to get on their app and search for a different flight yourself. We are a family of 4: 2 adults and 2 small children. It was impossible to find any alternative flight on the same day to the same destination with 4 free seats. The app also didn't find any available hotel. Spending a night in the airport with 2 small children is not an option. So we had to find another flight to another destination in another country and pay everything ourselves on the spot. That's not the biggest problem though. The problem is, EasyJet now does not want to take responsibility and reimburse the extra costs, as the circumstances were ""out of their control"". I understand that bad things happen and flights get cancelled, but as a company, at least offer assistance or reimbursement to those that they leave stranded. I will never fly easyJet again.",negative
"  Delays delays, delays. First time I used this airline. Leaving Gatwick and returning. I can understand there can be delays but its the lack of communication that got to me. Why don't Easyjet communicate their problems and solutions so that at least we know what's going on! From what I saw and heard I believe that Easyjet have a shortage of staff problem and that causes all these delays! Customer service is important Easyjet, take care of us and you won't have all these negative reviews",negative
" I am writing to express my deep disappointment and sheer frustration with the appalling service I experienced during my recent flight with EasyJet on 20th July 2023. My journey with your airline, on Flight EZY8312 from Milan Malpensa to London Gatwick, was an absolute nightmare from the very outset. To begin with, all the electronic check-in gates at Milan Malpensa Airport were either out of order or deliberately switched off, resulting in an infuriatingly slow and chaotic process. It was quite an ordeal to witness the incompetence of the ground staff, and to add to the misery, there was only one overwhelmed lady dealing with the needs of over three hundred passengers. It is beyond comprehension how an airline of EasyJet's stature could allow such a woefully understaffed situation to occur. Unfortunately, the frustration did not stop there. Upon reaching the departure gate, I was greeted with the distressing sight of an obviously intoxicated and vulgar man causing a commotion at the bar. It was abundantly clear to anyone with basic judgment that this individual was in no condition to fly. He then proceeded to wander around the terminal, rudely interacting with both staff and passengers, while attempting to light a cigarette. The potential safety risk he posed to everyone on the flight was glaringly evident, and I was utterly shocked to witness the inaction of the EasyJet staff in preventing him from boarding the plane. As time passed, the intoxicated passenger's behavior grew increasingly aggressive towards anyone who dared to approach him. Astonishingly, the gate staff checked him in without any regard for the safety of the other passengers, allowing him to board the plane despite the obvious risk he presented. I was among the last passengers to board, and the atmosphere on the plane was one of fear and discomfort as this individual continued to disrupt and behave aggressively throughout the flight. Only after an excruciating two-hour delay and numerous complaints from concerned passengers did the decision to call the police to remove the intoxicated man from the flight finally come about. This delay was further compounded by the lack of clear communication from your staff. Even the pilot expressed disbelief at how this man was allowed to board the plane in his inebriated state. The incident not only caused unnecessary distress to passengers but also created an unprofessional and unsafe environment that is wholly unacceptable. The apparent indifference of your staff towards the welfare of your customers and their failure to act promptly in such a dangerously evident situation is deeply reprehensible.",negative
"  Booked a flight from Amsterdam to London and back. The outbound flight did not take off. When I reached the airport it was delayed by 5 hours and then the board said cancelled. I booked the next flight (a new flight) and went anyway. The return flight was cancelled again (after our being on board for 2 hours) and a replacement flight was arranged on the following day (14 July). I could not afford that delay and took the Eurostar back. I understood that since I did not cancel the return flight I could not get compensated for it. But the onward flight had been a problem with the Airline. I filed for compensation and after 2 days got the message that I was not eligible for it because I did not travel on the flight. A cancelled flight and I was supposed to travel on it. I spent half an hour with an agent with capacity for inefficiency. She took fifteen minutes to grasp what I was looking for. And then she said the outbound flight was Delayed and Not Cancelled. I asked her why the board displayed Cancelled and whether the flight had taken off. She replied she could not say whether the flight had reached London or had taken off, but it was delayed for more than five hours and since I was not on it I was not eligible for a compensation. In the end I gave up. I'm never going to travel EasyJet again.",negative
"  EasyJet is truly horrible. I would never fly them ever again. I was stopped during the boarding of my flight and charged for a cabin bag and that too $58 for a small computer bag. I offered to pay a small fee so I can take it as a cabin bag and they declined, they forced me to take out my computer and carry it in my hand, which was absolutely ridiculous. The reps were unprofessional and would only argue their policy and flat out said if you don¡¯t do this you don¡¯t fly. I ended up paying $200 just for my bags so at the end of the day it was more expensive of a ticket than any other airlines. Not worth my dollars, I would rather spend it somewhere else. Worst airline I have had an experience with. ",negative
"  Another great flight with easyJet from Glasgow to Malaga and return. Boarding experience was good with pleasant ground staff, boarded on time but slight delay departing due to an air traffic control slot but made up some of the time inflight. Great onboard service with plenty of choice on offer. Cabin crew were professional and helpful. Similar experience on the way back with a delay due to air traffic control issues. ",positive
" Once again, EasyJet has cancelled another flight. This time has been from Rome Fiumicino to London Gatwick. They are cancelling many flights and it seems nothing is happening to EasyJet. They should be seriously be investigated and take the necessary measures to avoid they play with customers. I try to change to another date and customer service by phone were quite unhelpful and little comprehensive. European Union or the right organisation should look into them. Unfortunately, I booked a few more flights with them in the future and I feel really unconfident and stressed thinking about flight with them and would really wish to cancel them receiving the full refund. In fact, they have been in the news saying they are axing massively many flights and ruining holidays thousands of customers. As well, I read on news that their staff are pressured and working over hours. Hence cancellations.",negative
"  Worst experience ever, I have to cancel my reservation due a back injury that I'm going to have surgery for. When I informed easyJet of this and asked for a credit voucher so that when I recover from my surgery and able to travel again I can use this to book a flight using the money that I paid for the flight that has to be cancelled. They offered me nothing and customer service was extremely rude and disrespectful. They made numerous lies and insulted me and basically told me to get lost and told me that they was not going to do anything. This is the thanks that I got for years of flying on easyJet.",negative
"  The customer service on this airline is disgusting, me and my girlfriend was due to fly today from Gatwick to Larnaca, to get to the airport and all the way to boarding to be told the flight is cancelled with no explanation. There was no staff to explain where to go or what's going on then when we saw an easyjet employee walking past baggage claim we asked what to do to then be told to just go home and ring customer service. During this time we checked other flights and easyjet had nothing till 3 days later that was a 12 hour flight so we booked wizz air to fly the next day, After spending 90 minutes on hold and finally getting through to the most unhelpful employee they must of had in the department I asked them where I send this bill from the new flights to which was ?639, I was then told we was not entitled to any compensation not even for our troubles. I just want to add all other airlines were flying out of Gatwick no problems so this was clearly an easyjet issue. This is a 2nd class airline with under trained staff that only care about taking your money, we normally always fly with these and there are always delays but we normally make it to our destination, but as of today we won't be using them ever again.",negative
"  This airline is a complete shambles! We arrived at the airport, our flight was delayed for 30 mins, We then boarded the plane, when we were all seated the captain mentioned there would be a short delay, due to the tyre needing looked at (which we now know this was just the excuse for not having enough staff for our flight). We sat in the plane for another hour then the captain came back with the real reason why we hadn't moved - we are waiting on new cabin crew coming to the plane and we can't find them! They're in the airport somewhere so please bear with us! Really professional.  After 3 hours of sitting on the plane we were then informed that they have found the cabin crew. Cabin crew entered the plane to applause from everyone, however this little bit of joy was not too last. After 5 hours we taxied getting ready for take off then the plane engines stopped and we were informed that our flight was being cancelled! We were then taken from the plane and led through everyone that were awaiting to board other flights like refugees it was embarrassing, when we got to the Swiss port info desk we were then told that easyjet do not have an information desk at the airport anymore, so there was no easyjet rep to explain anything! We were then led to the luggage retrieval belt to wait on our luggage which took a further 2 hours to come out, whilst waiting I noticed young children crying and elderly people so tired and stressed out lying in corners deflated. We were informed by the easyjet app that our whole holiday had been cancelled and we can apply for a full refund (which I'm still awaiting on) and we could claim for compensation. This is were the plot thickens. We got home after 12 hours of stress the next morning I filled in a claim for compensation only to be told a day later that we our not entitled to any because the plane was grounded due to damage on the tyre! Well if that was the case why leave us on damaged plane for 5 hours? This is easyjets legal loophole to get away without paying out compensation claims. I sincerely hope they go bust because in my opinion this company are just about greed, making as much money as they possibly can without a thought of the stress and anxiety that they put hard working families that have promised their kids a great holiday only to have that dream shattered. Easyjet you are a disgrace and I hope that someone/group challenge these unscrupulous people in court.",negative
  It¡¯s a horrible airline. 4 hours before departure they delayed flight and when I was already at airport they cancelled flight. And only one that can offer you its refund. It¡¯s specially helpful when you lost booking on hotel and need to figure out how to get to destination by yourself and buy overpriced tickets!,negative
" Very poor service. I have had to use multiple times due to being the only option on a particular route but every time my flights have been heavily delayed or cancelled. Due to staffing issues but they lie and blame other factors to avoid paying compensation. No support when flights get cancelled, very poor quality airline. Completely unreliable and with flight cancellations, you'll likely be stuck with no solution and no one to help. Pay a little extra and fly with a different airline or use another airport, it's worth every penny avoiding. Most recent experience, flight cancelled while at the airport after multiple delays (this is the 3rd time of this happening in the space of a few months) with zero support or help, stuck for days trying to travel.",negative
"  easyJet left us stranded abroad twice with no money, food, clothing, hotel or way home. They turned off all methods of communication, didn¡¯t answer phone lines and put the phone down on customers. They have no staff in the airports and will tell you to pay for your own expenses and claim back, which they will then deny. They have cost us thousands and haven¡¯t been in touch with us at all. They¡¯ve even blocked our social media comments.  We were supposed to return to the U.K. on the 23rd from Croatia, and so we headed to the airport for our flight from Split to Manchester. We sat for hours in the airport, and noted delay after delay. During the delays, we received no updates from staff, only learning of delays from the easyJet app by checking manually and we were given no food or water. It¡¯s suggested that you should receive vouchers for the delay, but we never did and it would have gotten you a quarter of a bag of the cheapest chocolate from there anyway. Duty free was incredibly expensive and limited, as were the facilities. We sat there for hours and after lots of delays with no communication, easyJet cancelled the flight without notifying us and left everyone stranded in the airport with no help or guidance. The flight appeared as cancelled 40 minutes before the staff decided to make a tannoy announcement. You were left to rebook the flights through the EJ app; there were none for days and they booked up quickly so our group had to split and take whatever was available, paying for the hotel and other costs out of our pocket. The next direct flights weren¡¯t for days, and the other flights were all connecting ones to various places across Europe (Amsterdam, Milan, Rome) etc and not only were they with huge layovers, there were not enough seats on any of them, and also experienced the problem of being during the following days. Our smaller group had taken the Croatia to Milan connecting flight option, as we had group members with limited medication and health issues which we decided were the most important people to get to the U.K. earlier. We were unhappy with all the travelling time but it was the fastest option back into the U.K and we would have been trapped abroad for weeks otherwise, rather than days, so we were left with little choice. As there was no contact from easyJet and the staff were unhelpful, we also had to find a hotel at 11:30pm at night and then also find a way to get to it. Due to the timings, we had no food or water, and no breakfast but due to the dwindling amount of supplies and money we had on us, we had to keep our morning flight to Milan without being able to access any clean clothing or supplies. We did contact our travel insurance but as it was nearly midnight they were closed, and the next day they were completely unhelpful too as they state it is an issue for easyJet to resolve first, so they cannot and would not help. We went through the airport as normal the next day, and boarded our flight. We were told our flight was full, and therefore only 4 of us out of our group of 8 managed to make it on this flight.",negative

"  Delay of minimum 1 hour and 30 minutes. When I did the flight from London Gatwick to Cagliari, another hour and an half delay. Last month I flew from Gibraltar to London Gatwick. It was canceled in the last minute. I check on Facebook group and it seems it is quite common on EasyJet this year. They are using always the same excuse. 'Poor weather condition'. It is a cheap excuse really and an investigation should be opened against the. I wouldn't want to use EasyJet anymore nor wouldn't recommend it so far",negative

At least they told me via the app that my flight had been delayed from 18.00 to 20.50. albeit I'd already set off for the airport. Spent nearly 5 hours in Manchester Airport. Never a pleasant experience, but 5 hours! Apologies from the staff at the gate and on the plane, but no mention of compensation, refreshments etc. Landed at Venice Airport too late for my courtesy shuttle bus or for public transport, and had to get a taxi to my hotel - cost 50€. Got to bed so late that wasn't fit to do much the next day, so day wasted. Now applying for compensation.",negative

" Flight EJU7628 FNC-LIS was originally scheduled to leave at 22:00 on 02.06.2023 but was considerably delayed until 00:00 on 03.06.2023. The boarding staff at Funchal then informed that the flight had been cancelled. All passengers had already shown their boarding card and identification document. The boarding staff did not give any reason for the cancellation, only that they had just been informed. easyJet did not volunteer to send any messages during this hiatus. Legitimately outraged passengers shouted insults and kicked the easyJet queue separators. easyJet had a crew strike scheduled for 03.06.2023 from 00:00 but claims the ""delay"" [cancellation], was due to problems with the control tower, which is highly dubious because the TAP, Ryanair and SATA flights landed after the easyJet plane from Lisbon at 23:10 on 02.06.2023, without any disruptions. It was reported that easyJet had been transferring planes from European bases to Portugal with non-Portuguese crew, this combined with the strike in Portugal I believe was the real reason for the cancelation or delay, so the crew exceeded flight times. Despite appearing on the movement panel of Funchal airport as a cancelled flight, having in my possession and that I attach, photo with date and time watermark, besides the visible time on the panel itself, that the flight was cancelled. At this moment, abandoned at Funchal airport, I am forced to rebook a flight to Lisbon as soon as possible, which cost me an extra expense, inherent to easyJet's lack of professionalism, of 312.99 euros. Everything lead me to believe, with no room for doubt, that the flight was cancelled. Only at 01:30 of 03.06.2023, when I had already been forced to reschedule my trip due to easyJet's total lack of diligence, does easyJet send an SMS that the flight was rescheduled for 12:00 of 03.06.2023, 14 hours after the scheduled and original departure of the flight. easyJet did not provide the possibility to accept or refuse the rerouting, they only changed the booking and checked in by myself, without any consent, whether I accepted the new flight, wanted a cash or voucher refund. Under the terms of Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, of 11 February 2004, I am entitled to compensation for the 14-hour delay I suffered - if it is not correctly considered that this was an effective cancellation - to the value of at least 250.00 euros plus the expenses incurred with the need to rebook on the nearest flight (312.99 euros), since easyJet had not informed passengers until 1.30 am on 3 June 2023. This makes a minimum total of €562.99, which I will never give up. Beware of this company.",negative
"  If you want to travel to EU from London, I'd suggest you use any other company. I flew to Naples on the 3/06/23. The flight landed in a different airport from what it should have been - we were informed halfway through the flight that we had missed NAP closing time by 6 minutes, and had to land in Milan (800km away) instead. Surely, EasyJet would have checked with Naples airport that we were ok to land at the ETA to authorise departure. I'm sure that, where there's a risk of missing closing time by 6 mins as we were told, the considerate & reasonable thing to do would be to cancel the flight. I have reasons to believe that this was not done so that the incident could be marked as ""exceptional circumstances"", so that EasyJet could get away with not refunding passengers as per its refund policy. So either the staff was so na?ve as to not consider that flights can miss closing time by 6 mins, or this was deliberate fraudulent behaviour. Either way, it was unacceptable. EasyJet kept us waiting 5 hours at the airport, before boarding us and only then diverting our plane. We were also promised that EasyJet would provide accommodation and alternative transport, only to find out after 2 hours' wait that no, this would not be provided and we would have to think for ourselves. I was going to Naples to attend a wedding, which I missed. I cannot think of anything that would repay me not only of the financial cost, but also the time waste (the whole trip took me 21 h), and the psychological stress the company has deliberately inflicted on me. It is appalling to see a company preferring the petty value of my ?300 ticket to a longer-run customer satisfaction and good publicity.",negative
"  They canceled my Stansted to Belfast flight, they offered no assistance at all, they handed out a leaflet and left us abandoned.

They did not highlight the changes in my bookings part of their app. they sent a single email to inform me of the changes. of the changed times of flights half of them were no longer any good to me. I could not amend the flights in the app or my bookings in the website. When I called them to change the flights to times that did work I had to queue for 22 mins to speak to someone, when I did speak to the man he told me he could not change the flights as his system ""the tools I am using are not working you will have to call back"". I then queued again for 35 mins to get through to someone who then put me on hold for a further 7 mins. she told me I could only change a single flight and then I would have to call back. easyJet sent me a single email changing 12 flights and then didn't allow me to amend to flights that worked for me without 12 queues of up to 35 mins. Eventually they told me I was not entitled to change the flights because they changed the flight by less than 3 hours.

"  Paid 53 euros to alter my flight due to an announced cabin crew strike in Portugal affecting the day I would originally fly. I have to be in Lisbon on that day since I have a flight connection. They then cancelled all flights for which the strike is due and gave the opportunity to affected passengers to freely reschedule their flights, get an reimbursment or a voucher. In my case, they don't think I should have my 53 euros back on top of 66,99 euros for the original flight, because, as per theirs 'expense claim' reason for not paying: 'The transport claimed is private arrangement as you made changes to your flight yourself so we will not be able to reimburse your claim for transport.' It is not a private arrangement, was booked through their website, for another one of their flights, on a day where the Portuguese cabin crew strike is not happening. It only happened because their cabin crew announced a strike in Portugal. I had problems before with them during the pandemic. They are not trustworthy, other low costs work much better than them.",negative
"  EasyJet is a solid reliable airline in Europe as long as you follow their rules. The app is the best APP I¡¯ve utilised, making flight changes simple. The airport experience is automated as much as is possible, but staff are around to assist and ensure you follow EasyJets rules on bags, sizes and boarding. Boarding is simple with 2 queues, one queue for those who pre-booked a large cabin bag, and a second queue for those who only have a small rucksack/handbag. The flight experience is comfortable and predictable, the crew are polite. The food available to purchase is excellent. Bags arrived quickly. Overall this is a low cost airline, but well organised and rules it clearly presents during the booking process. For cheap point to point in Europe it¡¯s excellent.

Finally the plane lands around 3:30pm and we were able to speak with someone but we were told no flight till 10pm now so have to leave security area. We waited etc 10pm comes and goes now flight saying is delayed till 1am. At about 11pm 1 person comes and tells us flight is now canceled due to staff having finished their flight hours. They made us wait all morning, evening and part o the night before we were told flight was cancelled. I was calling customer service as there were no easyjet representatives, they had no clue what was happening, when we finally spoke to someone at the airport they didn't have a clue either if were even were going to fly the next day or anything.

The only issue, which is valid for most low-cost airlines, was the boarding process, which have the passengers wait standing up on stairs standing by for the bus which will take you to the aircraft.",positive
" I am writing to denounce my profound regret regarding my flights with easyJet. Customers try to choose EasyJet because they are low costs but the hidden fees and the staff behaviour made me spend with easyJet really more than other airlines such as Air France or Lufthansa. I think that easyJet has many problems including the fact that a flight can only be changed for an important cost (?49) when it is within two months (who will book and change a flight before two months?). Hence the change would represent twice the price of the flight price. However, I am writing regarding a specific issue. Yesterday, I had two flights with easyJet, the first from Lyon to London Luton and the second from London Luton to Edinburgh. Three days before my flight I bought the right to have a large cabin bag (that cost me ?47 for the first flight and ?15 for the second one). Everything was OK with the first flight where I had my cabin bag with me in the cabin (where its place should be). However, in London Luton, the staff member at the check-in desk forced me to pay 48 additional pounds for the same cabin bag with a 10.9kg weight (in order to check it in as hold luggage). Please note that the same bag fitted really well on the plane for the first flight (from Lyon to London Luton). Moreover, I observed that other passengers had cabin bags larger than mine. Hence, today I observed that easyJet staff are not coherent in imposing additional fees to customers from one country to another. Also, they are not treating their customers in the same manner. I initially paid around ?22 for this flight. In the end, it cost me ?85: ?22 (initial payment) + ?15 (Large cabin bag ) + ?48 (when they forced me to check in the large cabin bag that was supposed to come with me in the cabin) In addition to this, you can read on the news every day about the high rate of delays and cancellations of this airline. Don't underestimate the stress that can be caused by this airline. Also, it has plenty of other low costs around that do not have such bad reviews from customers. So, I would advise anyone to avoid this airline.",negative
  The worst company with bag policy. Even if the luggage was in the dimensions given in the website I got a fine of 48 euros. Do not consider consider to choose this company over a bit more expensive companies.,negative
"  I have flown many low cost airlines including Ryanair with no issue, but I have never had a good experience with easyJet. I have flown with easyJet 20+ times but a staff are always rude (clearly not trained at all in customer service) and flights are delayed. This time round was the last straw. Not only was the flight delayed (again), the gate agent was extremely rude and unpleasant. I will never fly with them again.",negative
"  No complaints. Smooth and attentive service . Comfortable seats and food good. The flight left 45 minutes late and arrived 7 minutes early. Luton Airport isn't the best airport but I guess they have to base themselves somewhere so if it keeps the prices down then I will cope. Thank you EasyJet for a really nice, trouble-free journey - I will be back!",positive
" In the end the flight turned out to be ok, but the start was a disaster. We were checked and queued for quite some time, without being able to board. One man collapsed and needed emergency medical attention. The ground staff were overwhelmed and completely useless in this situation. It eventually turned out that the flight crew had to be replaced as the previous shift was already overtime, but no information was given, not a single announcement. I had the impression a group of amateurs were given the assignment to perform the boarding, very disturbing experience.",negative
"  It is clearly stated many times what the allowance is when booking and explained over and over. When you book a ticket, you have a basic ticket with only bring on a small bagpack that must fit under the seat in front of you. If you want to add a cabin bag, you pay for it.

I had asked, can you not make an exception and leave it next to the plane so that they put it in? She said, no you have to repay and then said, leave it next to the plane so that they put it in.

"  The check-in and security check was perfectly fine, both processing and staff. The hand luggage rules/measures are very confusing and are obviously created to make people pay for an extra fee. Also the construction of seats with a frame beneath doesn¡¯t allow regular hand luggage - although this frame (that might be necessary) could most probably have been constructed in a different way. Discussing this matter with the personnel at the gate at Rome (FCO) got very emotional and wasn¡¯t professional at all.",neutral
"  I have always travelled worldwide with my hand luggage suitcase, I have even worked for an airline and I have never had a problem with any other airline. My actual suitcase was brought as hand luggage dimensions requirements, only to find when boarding my flight from Manchester to Ibiza, a man, was standing where we pass with the boarding pass holding a credit card machine and stopping everyone with a hand luggage that didn't fit in which looked like a child size baggage gauge and apparently easyJet don't allow the wheels or handles to be included in the dimensions stated on their site. I wasn't the only one questioning this it looked like an easy money racketeering business going on threatening passengers that they cannot board until they have paid.",negative

When I travelled back to Amsterdam with a backpack and a small shopping bag (bought clothes from the airport) they add me a fee for ?39.99 before the boarding because I had too many bags on me. Since I am allowed to shop from the airport, why am I supposed to fit everything I bought in the airport  into my backpack?

"  Nothing wrong with the flight but rather than arrive at Gatwick north we arrived at Gatwick South. No announcement from the crew or anyone.

"  Departing from Amsterdam was unpleasant. The plane was delayed. First, all the passengers were sent down the stairs to the holding area H2, then told to go back up to H pier corridor as there might be a gate change. Hardly any seating in H pier so I had to stand for ages. There wasn¡¯t a gate change so we all went down the stairs again. This meant that I had to put my official EasyJet size cabin baggage into the frame twice. Each time it fitted of course but I had difficulty getting it out again each time. I arrived safely at Luton Airport more than an hour late. The return journey was punctual but at the departure gate I had the same problem with my cabin baggage, the ground steward came across as rather aggressive. There was a long wait on the stairs before boarding. This airline flies me to Luton near to where I need to be.",negative

 Had a difficult boarding due to a mix up with luggage tagging by ground staff. There was also a young couple with 3 children who needed to be sitting together.

Hats off to the team for making our flight so comfortable.,positive
"  It's several years since we have flown with any other airline but easyJet, which I think speaks for itself. We have in the past used Ryanair occasionally but once they started seating couples separately if they did not pay for seats we ceased to do so. EasyJet suits us perfectly and flies to the places we want to visit. We were apprehensive when the rules / charges relating to baggage taken on board were changed, but we experimented flying with backpacks only which will fit under the seats in front and found that we could easily manage with those for a week's holiday. Since then we have happily travelled lightly and found it very easy indeed. We actually registered the fact on our most recent trip that is the ""Speedy Boarding"" passengers who now rush to queue when the boarding staff appear because they want to make sure of finding locker space as close to their seats as possible. The rest of us who have not paid extra for anything can just wait and board at our leisure. I can't recall more than one major delay in all the years we have used easyJet and just a few minor ones. On our last trip earlier this month both the outward and inward flights left and arrived slightly early. Flying out from Liverpool as we invariably do, we find it very rare that there is any nitpicking about bag sizes (despite some of the bags that we sometimes see!) and the whole process of flying with easyJet for us is relatively relaxed. It obviously helps that we know the ropes and that we keep abreast of any rule changes e.g. regarding baggage. It does seem to me that some of the critics fail to check on things like this and therefore are at least partly to blame when faced with charges they did not expect.",neutral
"  Flight departed on schedule and arrived 20 minutes early. Well organised boarding in Gran Canaria with separate speedy boarding. Cabin crew were very professional, friendly and welcoming onboard.

" I live in London and my family is in Izmir. I fly London-Izmir frequently in the last 2 years. First time ever additional ?40 was charged for my cabin baggage that I always use. It is a standard one, I bought it from Samsonite just for flights as cabin luggage. This is definitely wrong what you are doing. My total trip London-Antalya, Antalya-Izmir, Izmir-Antalya, Antalya-London (4 flights) cost me ?140 and just the cabin luggage extra charge cost me ?40 because it didn't fit into your small (not standard) measurement box. The luggage measurement in their app shows my luggage is ok but in the airport, they charge an additional huge amount. This is not ethical and can't be legal too. I will never fly again with EasyJet and don't recommend this money-hungry airline company.",negative
" Worst flight experience. Starting from the start of the journey from the baggage drop, I was asked to pay extra and yet wasn¡¯t informed that I would have to pay extra for my cabin bags. Later, at the boarding I was asked to pay extra and then wasn¡¯t even given an answer when I questioned about the same. Also, the lady at the counter was extremely misbehaved and didn¡¯t talk or attend us well. She was more and more concern about the money being paid, and once we were quoted a specific amount to pay she all of a sudden increased the charges. It¡¯s extremely disrespectful of her and a complete shame on the airlines how they treat their passengers. Are bags were very well going to fit in the required measurements. But still we ended up paying 106€ because no one was INTERESTED in listening and resolving the concern.",negative

I have been told by staff that my bag was too large and I would have to pay for it.

Thankfully, a second hostess came by, recognized the error and took us in.",neutral
 Really bad airline. Rather than provided accurate information eg flight is delayed until x just kept providing an estimate of when the flight is to land. Never ever been on a flight with them that is on time. Very unreliable airline.,negative
  EasyJet lost my bag. I had to fill an online form for lost baggage. They gave updates on the bag status for 3 weeks. Post that the status was removed. No compensation was paid. The airline staff was helpful at the airport however they were Ill treated by various contracted service providers of easyJet. Besides this the airport facilities provided by easyJet are horrible. One has to check in ones luggage at the checkin. The instructions on the checking machines are inadequate. These machines fail to scan the bar codes on the boarding passes. The only relief is good and helpful staff but the numbers are too low. ,negative
"  Do not use this airline. My flight was cancelled and they refunded 10% of the money and refuse to investigate where the remainder is. For the last 2 weeks they have used delay tactics to send me back to the bank. Even my bank has said they¡¯re delaying the refund. How can 1 of 8 refund transactions go through but 7 don¡¯t. Now Easyjet refuse to investigate it further until I get a letter from my bank saying they don¡¯t have the money. So, either I¡¯m a liar or my bank are apparently? I¡¯m pretty sure this is illegal, delaying a refund like this. ",negative

"  Really bad and poor customer service and manage booking system. I had booked two EasyJet tickets for a flight this Christmas from Uk to Spain. I tried to add a selected seat today Nov 26th for one of the passengers, which included an extra large cabin bag and other different perks. Unfortunately, their system when you tried to get one of those selected seats, it does not allow you to continue with the process without buying obligatory another seat for the other passenger even I do not need it. So I decided to contact them by chat to see if they can get me a solution. After expending 30 minutes chatting with the customer service agent, he told me that he can provide me with this service but ?5 more expensive than the website price. I asked him, why, and he mentioned that doing it through the website is cheaper. The situation was ridiculous, even though I spent precious time chatting with him, EasyJet wants to charge me more because of their badly designed system. I wished I could do it by the website without expending more time. So I recommend to people to even booked passenger tickets separately and you can manage the options individually or book flight tickets with another company which has a better system, EasyJet tries to get as much money as they can from their loyal customers. But never more, even I was one of the people affected by their famous data breach and never claim anything because I have been using Easy Jet for a long time and always I had good service. But not anymore, I am very disappointed with them and I encourage other people to go for different airline companies. EasyJet never again.",negative
" While booking it all seems to be a very nice airline mainly because its cheap. I flew from Berlin to Amsterdam on November 18, flight EJU5107 seat 12A (exit row). Immediately I noticed that the flight was seriously delayed. During boarding, the easyJet ground staff is very unclear about who should board first. Nothing was announced either. As a result, it turned into chaos. After I boarded the plane, certain staff seem to speak very bad English. That shouldn't be too much of a problem, this becomes dangerous when there's an emergency and you need to communicate. I have flown with easyJet on a regular basis and all easyJet flights are always delayed (over an hour). Therefore I'm not recommending easyJet, especially for passengers who have a transfer where there is a high chance that they will miss their flight. The good thing is that the seats are very comfortable. Better than other low cost airlines.",neutral

" Four people in our tour group made our own reservations for a trip from the US to Paris. The travel day began with the initial flight and then Easy Jet reservations were made to fly hours later to Lisbon Portugal. We landed on time at CDG airport and received notification from Easy Jet that our flight to Lisbon was delayed for 90 minutes. No issue there for us - just a bit more time to stretch our legs. The communication from Easy Jet came in a text. I still have a picture of the text received. We arrived at the gate prior to the original departure time to find that the flight was only 11 minutes late and because we were not at the gate two hours prior to the original departure time we were not allowed to board the airplane. The gate agent would lend absolutely no support. We were not the only passengers that were left that day. We each purchased our ticket and a carry on bag for the flight. There were no other flights from CDG airport available to Lisbon that day which was not an option for us as we had to meet our tour group. We each had to make reservations for TAP Portugal out of Orly Airport - about an hour Uber Drive from CDG. This expenditure cost each of us nearly $400 - the Uber Drive, the last minute flight and the baggage. I reached out to Easy Jet upon our arrival home. The emails have been non-stop with sending our information, picture of the text message received and basic pleading to have our money refunded. We were only issued the tax on the flight which came to $19.06 Euro. We will never travel Easy Jet in the future. We will share our experience to whoever will listen and get the word out that this company takes no responsibility for their lack of customer service and their lack of communication. The deal we received in booking this reservation was excellent so in good faith, reimbursing each of us would not have broken the bank for the company.

"  Dodgy tactics to milk your money, never pay for extra services, you won't get anything extra. The only good aspect will be low prices if you are traveling alone with small or no bags. I've traveled with them 6 times, the first 2 times I paid for the speedy boarding + cabin bag, but was shocked by the complete chaos in boarding where everyone was boarding at the same time either standard or speedy, and I even couldn't find a place to put by bag (all was taken), had to put away from where I sit although I paid extra for an overhead cabin bag. The next 4 times, I just opted for the standard service as everyone apparently was getting the same service, and used the same cabin bag every time. On my most recent one, the flight was delayed almost an hour, stood in the queue for a long time then when boarding started the employee asked me to get out of the queue to fit my bag in the scale, at this point, I was extremely exhausted and didn't want to lose my place in the queue so told her I will just pay whatever the extra cost to get on the plane.

Then on the way back on the 3rd of October Ezy6414 @ 9:15, they decided my standard bag was too big for the cabin, because apparently on Feb2021, they shrunk the seats and the cabin size even more, and charged me ?24 for it. That bag was half empty, I could have brought a smaller one had I known. Why are they going against standardisation? They actively want to catch you, the lady there could have let it go, it's not like that money goes to her pocket, but some people enjoy letting others down. They must hate their jobs immensely (customer service is difficult, especially with money grabbing management that are paid 6digits compared to people in her level with 1.65bn revenue).

I called to have my flight rebooked to an earlier flight and explained my frustration at the fact that no one had contacted me in advance. I was told that my seats would be rebooked for the new flight to the extra legroom seats I had before. The next day I called again to explain that the reservation does not have me in an extra legroom seat as I paid for and asked this to be corrected. The person on the line was not willing to refund my fee as I that would mean I would also have to give up the cabin baggage allowance I also paid for. I explained to him how frustrated this was for me as a customer, and at the end of the call he asked me to hang up on me before he hung up on me himself. This is a poor example of customer service, and if the trip wasn't so last minute, I would ask for a refund and take my business elsewhere. I am not responsible for the flight being cancelled last minute and I made all the arrangements in advance to ensure a smooth trip. I am beyond disappointed in the service I've received and will consider this when making future reservations.",negative

  Worst flight company ever. Flight was delayed.

"  Do not book with this airline, after waiting over 8 hours at Rhodes airport, with no information no staff no offer of water, our return flight was cancelled, had to find our own accommodation at 3.30 am and pay for it and the taxi, flight rescheduled for the following day at 4.30 pm. Once again waited around as flight delayed, no information, finally board flight, had to wait an hour and a half for take off on the plane, finally take off, told plane has not restocked with drinks etc. Finally land then had to wait nearly two hours for our luggage to be released. Applied for compensation for my cancelled flight and expenses which has been rejected as it was cancelled for extreme circumstances - ie Gatwick would not give them a landing slot the previous evening. So having spent over ?400, in extra expenses due to EasyJet they have paid any compensation, I¡¯m sure they must have to be compensated by Gatwick for having to keep their pilot and staff for longer. Will never fly with them again. Do not use them.",negative
"  At first, the ground crew manager came up to the passengers asking for volunteers to change to another flight (they would fly to Santiago de Compostela instead, and have a bus waiting for them to take them to Porto, and all they offered was a 500€ compensation, which is much less than what they should actually have to pay every passenger if no one took the offer and they had to refuse entry to passengers) as they mismanaged and overbooked this flight (even though they kept insisting on that it was an aircraft issue and they had to use a smaller one, while the people at the check in desks said clearly that it was overbooked). After that, the boarding process took ages, as some people had their passes invalidated due to the mentioned overbooking issue, meaning their seats (mine included) were unavailable. What's funny about this is that even people in rows as low as 10-15 or so had their seats invalidated. Anyway the boarding process took well over an hour for the lucky ones, all the while the ground crew was being extremely rude to people that didn't yet fully understand the issue, instead of explaining what they were trying to do to solve the issue (we passengers do not care how your worthless service screwed up the bookings, do not belittle us for not understanding what stupid excuses you make). Now for the unlucky ones that had their seats invalidated, we were put to the side while they tried to figure out what to do, all the while the ground crew kept insisting for us to take the 500€ and go on another flight or whatever, which I find extremely distasteful, knowing that all of us should be compensated much better had we been refused entry. Some people that were put to the side still accepted the offer, which in the end did make room for everyone else on the flight, after of course another hour or so of waiting. Now with all that said, I wouldn't have minded the issue as much if it weren't for the rudeness of the ground crew, the almost 2 hours of keeping us in the dark about what was going to happen to us, and the persistence of the ground crew manager to have us go to another flight, if you really wanted that to happen offer something better than just 500€, you know very well the compensation the airline would have to give us had we been refused entry. To add insult to injury, when at last the flight took off, we weren't offered anything at all in flight, not one measly bottle of water or a bag of chips or a small cup of coffee, nothing, absolutely worst customer service ever. As a bonus, the cabin crew hit my leg with the food/beverage cart while I was sleeping, admittedly I had my leg on the corridor, which I hadn't done on purpose or willingly, but instead of waking me up to move my leg, they just hit it and all I got was a ""Oh sorry sir"", then the attendant moved on like nothing happened. It only hurt for a bit, it's not like I want monetary compensation or anything for that, but yeah a cup of coffee could have made it up for almost everything. Worst airline I used so far, don't recommend it, I certainly won't be using it ever again.",negative
"  My paid cabin bag was 1cm too long but several cm below the height and depth limits. However the ground staff would not let me bring it on the plane and it was sent to the hold with a 30 euro excess. On the plane the luggage racks were half empty. This militant fund raising exercise is ridiculous. I had bright the exact Same bag on the incoming leg a few days earlier. Oh, and both flights were over two hours late.",negative
"  I purchased 2 tickets and paid for ""Standard Plus"" . The speedy boarding and hold luggage was included. This was shown on our boarding passes When I arrived at the gate the employee of easyjet insisted that I had to pay for the hold luggage. I showed him the boarding pass showing that I had paid for speedy boarding etc. He said that was irrelevant as his records showed that I needed to pay. As I had to board the flight I paid for this. Following this I found proof of the previous payment and showed him, but he said it was ""too late now and I need to apply for the refund."" ",negative
"  The flight was delayed for 2.5hrs, causing us to miss our bus (which had a 90mins buffer for the original arrival time), we then had to book alternative travel, which cost as much as the flight ticket. Instead of 27e and being home before midnight, we spent 180e+ and were home at 02:30 am. Contacting easyJet to get some sort of reimbursement is a nightmare, apparently getting reimbursement for a delayed flight isn't possible, the reason given, because it was delayed. The delay according to EasyJet was extraordinary circumstances, according to our pilot these circumstances were EasyJet running an overfull schedule that Gatwick could not service, and EasyJet not having staff to service these flights. The impression I'm given by easyJet's communication then is that it's my own fault for having incurred additional costs on arrival because I choose to fly with EasyJet. I used to love EasyJet before the pandemic, but now I, unfortunately, must advise anyone who considers them to definitely avoid them.",negative
"  Flight was delayed for two hours, when we finally got off the ground I was tired and hoping to sleep through the 1.5hr flight. However, all 5 air hostesses were sat right behind us gossiping loudly. After about 15 minutes I turned around and asked if they could keep the noise down a little, as I was tired and trying to nap after the delayed flight. In response I was met with hostilities, one of the hostesses telling me I'm not in a hotel and shouldn't feel so entitled. I couldn't believe it, and they continued to say nasty things about me and my partner for the rest of the flight. Even when we were leaving the plane they decided to make snarky jokes about my partner to her face. Absolutely no consideration for their customers and even happy to insult their customers in front of them. Customer service is non existent with this company, but if you'd like to be verbally abused throughout the duration of your flight and pay for the privilege, go right ahead. Myself, never ever again, absolutely disgusting.",negative
"  I would like to report on a very unpleasant experience with a baggage inspector and in this context I would like to claim back the illegally collected fine of 29€. The whole thing happened on August 17th, 2022 at around 6:20 p.m. at Gate A38 of BER Airport, where I and my travel companion should have boarded flight EJU5539 to Paris Orly at 5:35 p.m. So the flight was already delayed. Shortly before passing the counter, a very unfriendly baggage inspector waved me out. He said my hand luggage was too big. It was a business case (see picture attached), which I have been using for years with EasyJet. On the baggage measurement system, it also fitted perfectly in terms of height and width. It only exceeded the thickness by a minimum of approx. 0.5 cm (which the baggage inspector had to indicate with a pen).  When I then took the suitcase to repack something for my travel companion, the employee yelled at me where I wanted to go. He threatened me it's too late, I have to pay or the luggage will stay here. After I still managed to take out a few things and the case continued to protrude slightly over the limit, I tried to explain to the employee that this is just air in the case and that the exact dimensions can be maintained by pressing lightly. The employee then slapped my hands and yelled ""hands off"" and threatened again that the suitcase had to stay here. Under this pressure, I paid in order not to miss the flight. I suspect that the employee deliberately wanted to play off his position of power. Unfortunately there is no way to counteract this. The customer service in particular treats the customers here like dirt. Either you get an email with an answer with copy & paste FAQ's or on Instagram it is claimed that unfortunately nothing can be done. (Where there is a will, there is a way? ) Hiermit m?chte ich von einer sehr unangenehmen Erfahrung mit einem Gep?ckkontrolleur berichten und in diesem Zusammenhang die widerrechtlich eingezogene Strafgeb¨¹hr von 29€ (siehe Kontoauszug) zur¨¹ckfordern. Das ganze spielte sich den 17.08.22 um ca. 18:20 am Gate A38 des Flughafen BER ab, an welchem ich mit meiner Reisebegleitung bereits um 17:35 auf den Flug EJU5539 nach Paris Orly h?tte boarden sollen. Der Flug war also schon versp?tet. Kurz vor passieren des Schalters winkte mich dann ein sehr unfreundlicher Gep?ckkontrolleur heraus. Er meinte mein Handgep?ckst¨¹ck sei zu gro?. Dabei handelte es sich um einen Business Koffer (siehe Bild im Anhang), mit dem ich schon seit Jahren problemlos mit EasyJet reiste. Auf der Gep?ckmessanlage passte er von H?he und Breite dementsprechend auch perfekt rein. Lediglich die Dicke ¨¹berschritt er minimal um ca. 0,5 cm (was der Gep?ckkontrolleur mit einem Kugelschreiber andeuten musste). Als ich dann den Koffer nahm, um etwas zu meiner Reisebegleitung umzupacken schrie mich der Mitarbeiter an wo ich hinwollte. Er drohte mir es ist zu sp?t, ich muss zahlen oder das Gep?ck bliebe hier. Nachdem ich es dennoch schaffte ein paar Sachen herauszunehmen und der Koffer weiterhin minimal ¨¹ber die Begrenzung ragte, versuchte ich dem Mitarbeiter zu verdeutlichen, dass dies nur Luft im Koffer ist und durch leichtes andr¨¹cken exakt die Ma?e eingehalten werden. Daraufhin schlug der Mitarbeiter auf meine H?nde und schrie ,,H?nde weg"" und drohte erneut, dass der Koffer hierbleiben m¨¹sse. Unter diesem Druck zahlte ich, um den Flug nicht zu verpassen. Ich vermute, dass der Mitarbeiter bewusst seine Machtposition ausspielen wollte. Leider gibt es keine M?glichkeit dagegen vorzugehen. Insbesondere der Kundenservice behandelt die Kunden hier wie Dreck. Entweder man bekommt als Mail eine Antwort mit Copy&Paste FAQ's oder auf Instagram wird behauptet man k?nne da leider nichts tun.

  Take very good care at online check-in. I had purchased cabin baggage when I bought my ticket. At check in I opted for a seat change. I did not add cabin baggage because I had already bought it. Upon confirmation I found to my shock that my cabin baggage had disappeared. It was no longer possible to change that. Customer service was useless. I was forced to buy hold luggage at an additional GBP 28.49 because cabin baggage was no longer available.

  Easyjet is the Worst airline by far that I have flown. Standing in line here at Tivat airport in Montenegro for 1.5 hours waiting for boarding as the monitors say boarding on time at 1:30pm. At 2:15pm the terminals are still saying on time departure at 1:30! Not a single easy jet rep around to even ask a question. Even easyjet's website says departure at 1:30pm and on time even though it is already 2:15pm. Pathetic is an understatement! Lat time I am flying with these guys.,negative

The flight was shorter than 1500 km with two hours of delay for European regulation the airline company should have offered us drinks and snacks and kept us up to date with the reason of the delay but nothing of this happens. Our understanding is the airport was missing staff. When we asked to the hostess in charge for drinks and food she answered we left Milano at 22 when it was obvious to everyone it was wrong.

Unbelievable, how can this even happen they have planning people?

Although it took me 2 emails and one phone call hanging on for 25 minutes without reply, the 2nd call was answered within 10 minutes and the extremely helpful young man whom I spoke to was very very helpful and discussed this with his managers and they agreed to grant me a refund due to exceptional circumstances, I cannot praise Easyjet enough for their prompt action which has taken a huge amount of weight off my mind. We have always found them an exceptionally good airline to fly with and not experienced any delays.

Easyjet insist they have zero responsibility as we arrived 1.35 mins after time published for arrival so under the 2 hrs. They can get away with this by grossly exaggerating arrival time. I wondered why they were saying this short hop took so long, now I know. They are dishonest and bordering on corrupt. We had a horrific time at Gatwick, met with disdain by the most unprofessional person I've ever met. Told to rebook missed flight for 2 days later and pay transfer of ?120. No assistance offered and absolutely no sympathy. Stayed in a hotel and flew with TUI the next day. They were wonderful in comparison. We all need to write to the transport secretary instead of Easyjet because they couldn't care less what customers are saying. They keep issuing lies about helping customers as much as they can but this is more corrupt nonsense. Why their staff put up with this chaos is beyond me, they should all follow their Italian colleagues and walk out. I hate to see jobs lost but I'd actually be happy to see Easyjet no longer exist. The people responsible for the current debacle wouldn't suffer of course.

It is now the end of May and I have made 2 failed attempts at claiming over ?700 worth of taxi bills that I had to pay for, due to there being 7 in our party and no 7 seater taxis available at 2 am in the morning when we arrived, with young children, almost 100 miles from our home and further from our car which was parked at Gatwick! Filled out the claim form and the person had the nerve to say they wouldn't give us a refund because the flight was only 4 minutes late!

"  Perfectly satisfactory flights. This was at a time when easyJet was getting a lot of media criticism because of cancellations due to staff Covid, but our experience was entirely positive. Rapid bag drop, speedy boarding was fully applied on this flight (not so good on the return, but that was down to the airport using buses for transfer to the plane), the flight left on time and arrived a little early, and the cabin crew were very pleasant. We had extra-legroom seats in one of the over wing emergency exit rows but the standard seats looked fine for someone my height (1.74 m). Space is helped by the thin seats, I was concerned on first sitting down that these seemed rather firm but they must be well shaped because I stayed comfortable for the 3hr50 flight. My only dissatisfaction would be with the price, hence my low mark for 'value for money' - it was ?600 each and, even given that it was the start of a UK holiday period, that's pretty eye watering.",positive

We went to boarding gate at departure time and staff said should have gone back through arrivals to check in to print pass, and we were creating problems. There were at least 10 passengers in the same boat who asked for boarding cards to be printed. Easyjet cancels the flight then expects checked in passengers to go back to check in then back through security?

We decided to go to the airport to see what our options would be, as we were travelling due to a family bereavement. We arrived at Bristol Airport at 0400 to be greeted by a very busy easyJet check in area. I made my way to the special assistance desk as this had the smallest queue. We were approached by a easyJet representative, I explained our situation and we were rudely told that we needed to go onto the easyJet app and to sort it out ourselves, they were too busy to help. I asked to speak to the duty manager, who eventually came over to see me, they explained that we were expected to manage our own booking via the app, after explaining out circumstances and the reasons we were due to travel they agreed to transfer us onto another easyJet flight to Antalya later on that day at 1520, and that we would have to pay for the onward 6 hour road transport to take us to our original location in Bodrum, to keep the receipt and claim the money back as there policy states they are only able to book road transport within the UK and not overseas. We were advised that our original flight was cancelled due to crew sickness. Apparently easyJet had no standby crew available in order to allow our flight to Bodrum depart. No empathy was shown by any easyJet ground staff at Bristol.

They hadn't been informed of the changes either. This was a holiday to celebrate my 50th birthday. I will never fly with Easyjet again. Shoddy, disgusting service.",negative
"  I've flown easyjet once before and I fly several times a month, they are by far the least accommodating. I showed up to the airport over an hour early and by the time I got to the counter I was refused entry due to being too close to the boarding time? Just absolutely ridiculous, never once in my life have I missed a flight and here I am at the airport having to make last minute arrangements due to the lack of competence easyjet and its employees have. It is also odd considering the last easyjet flight I took did not board until after its departure time causing me to sit at the airport for even long. I'm sure they're glad they got my money this last time though!",negative
" EasyJet lost my baggage and couldn't care less. After 48 hours they only sent one email saying ""sorry for any inconvenience"", but no updates to where my luggage is or when I will get it back. Should I go to the shop and buy a new wardrobe? There is no way of contacting them, no numbers are manned.",negative
  Very poor and lengthy bag drop plus poor gate/embarking arrangements. Took at least an hour to drop bag off leaving little time to use airport facilities at Malaga and gate was just as poorly managed.,negative
"  First time I come across a budget airline that only includes a small backpack as a base. Even the small cabin suitcase allowance is an add on. So we were forced to upgrade to ¡°upfront seats¡± (+25€ per person) to have a cabin suitcase. This option also includes a priority check in with the EasyJet Plus queue to skip the normal long single queue for check in (see screenshot of easyJet email). We arrived in the Lisbon airport terminal 2 more than 2 hours in advance though we knew that we could have priority check in at EasyJet plus. When we waited for a while and finally arrived at the counter 203, the woman there was very rude and told us they do not have priority boarding today and that she doesn¡¯t know anything about it. We insisted with the proof from our email we can skip the long queue at the check in counters. She didn¡¯t even bother to look at what was written in that easyJet email nor give any explanation to why this service was removed ¡°today¡±. She said the priority boarding is only for people who require special assistance. She was like ¡°oh your flight is to Paris, you¡¯ve got plenty of time¡± in a nonchalant manner. And she just spoke directly to the clients in the long queue, ¡°next one¡±, waving us away.  No apologies, no emails from easyJet communicating this before we arrive at the airport and nothing was written before people started queuing. We paid an extra 50 euros for this extra convenience but they did not honour their contract and completely ignored us at the EasyJet plus counter. We spoke to the service centre (Portway) for the airline at the airport but the woman there also refused to help. Said she can¡¯t do anything about it. So we waited almost 1.5 hours in the normal queue. After we got our boarding passes, I met a lady in front of us had the same case as what we endured, but worse. She was refused on the EasyJet plus priority check in queue and then refused her boarding because she was ¡°late¡±. So she missed her flight. Both of us arrived more than 2 hours before the flight time (the check in counter only opens 2 hours before the flight time). But I had to run to the gates in order not to miss my flight. We have taken many other low cost airlines like Transavia and Ryan Air, Jetstar, Tiger, Hong Kong Express but we never had any horrible experience like this.",negative
" Expensive and unreliable. Be careful, as the price you see is not the price you pay, which was for our trip, nearly three times more! The airline changed the time of the flight to an hour and a half later, which was then delayed, jeopardising our onward journey and effectively losing us a half day of our holiday - not to mention loss of sleep over the onward connection. The on-board staff were friendly and tried to be understanding, but the ground staff were among the rudest I've ever encountered.",negative
"  My flight was cancelled due to the weather conditions and they informed the cancellation of the flight just 10mins before flight departure. Instead of helping us get another flight, they told us to go back to departure gate and no one was even there on the gate. And then we were told to rebook our flight online and then we were just told to leave the airport which took around 2hrs due to the security. I saw the departure of so many flights which were scheduled just within 1hrs of my flight. They could have delayed my flight maybe or at least assisted in rebooking but they chose to do nothing. Amidst this chaos, where I was still processing what was happening, I rebooked the wrong flight and I have been trying to contact the customer service but guess what no one is responding. There's no customer service at airport and they don't respond online. Wouldn't recommend the flight to anyone.",negative
"  A quick, efficient, friendly service from easyJet. The plane arrived on stand from a previous sector and was turned around in less than 20 minutes! The crew on board were welcoming and a credit to the airline. Only thing which let it down was the slow ground service at Belfast Int¡¯l in unloading but not the airline¡¯s fault. Overall, a great experience. Will definitely use easyJet for my next trip!",positive
"  I was unable to go on this flight due to the COVID restrictions introduced by the German government. EasyJet refused to let me cancel or give me any kind of refund despite claiming that the flight was converted for COVID cancellations when I booked. I would absolutely not recommend EasyJet for COVID era travel, they don¡¯t care about their customers at all.",negative
" Paid 533 euros, as per proof sent to Skytrax, with one change of dates, for this domestic flight of 01h20m. If this is not extortion I don't know what is. The plane was crowded, there was not enough space for baggage, the cabin was too warm, crew were Portuguese whom have become increasingly unfriendly, unnecessarily formal and even arrogant, easyJet have absorbed TAP's vicious habits in this route and what it seems their crew from 4 years ago. The resuming of flights by Ryanair on this route will put them back on their knees from where they shouldn't have left. Unfortunately they will very likely try to hijack the Regional Government with artificial arguments, which by incompetence, ignorance or dissimulation, they could concede to even more 'support', as if they needed. It is how this so called low cost airlines work. Commercial aviation needs urgent supervision by national Regulators. On a positive note which isn't enough to give them more than one star rating, their telephone support actually works and is attentive, however as per usual with airlines this may change from one day to another.",negative
"  Together with my husband and five-year-old son, we arrived at the airport in advance due to the purchased additional luggage (23kg) We were one of the first to check-in because many people who flew to Berlin at that time had a problem with checking in at the airport by Easy Jet at a time when other airlines (e.g. Ryanair) did not have these problems. Aweek before departure, we observed changes overnight in the restrictions introduced in Germany due to the prevailing pandemic. We have completed all the documents required by the German side so that our trip could take place. In addition, we checked the EasyJet app and EasyJet Hub every day to be sure that any additional changes would not affect our flight. The last change made to the Easyjet Hub took place on December 20. On the day of departure, the Easy jet staff responsible for boarding informed us that we would not be admitted to the flight to Berlin because we have Polish passports and we do not have a transit ticket (from Berlin Brandenburg airport to another airport). The situation was extremely stressful for us, because despite having all the necessary documents, we were refused a flight. We asked to contact the shift manager to confirm this decision, informing in advance that we had spent too much time trying to resolve the situation, which could result in the inability to change the flight (we could have changed the flight up to 2 hours before departure) we informed the staff that I am pregnant and this situation stressed me as well as my five-year-old son, yet we were told to wait for the manager's decision. After two hours, we have been informed that we would not be allowed to fly despite the documents we presented due to the fact that the staff interpreted the restrictions in their own way. We asked the staff for help in changing tickets to another flight, but we were refused help, suggesting that we could contact customer service ourselves on the number that we can find on the Internet.  I tried to call customer service to explain the situation. Unfortunately, each of our attempts to connect ended with a broken signal despite no problems with the network.  At that time, we bought a next day flight from Manchester to Krakow, we had to perform additional tests on Covid because the previous certificates.",negative
  Both flight on A320. Boarding at HEL was chaotic because they were checking the vaccination certificate to passengers that had check-in electronically. At BER chick in was a breeze. Boarding was done with zone system; staff were easy going not creating problems with passengers carrying larger carry-ons. In flight service on menu buy items. Overall very good for low cost airline.,positive
"  I booked 2 tickets 28th Dec on Easyjet, Gatwick to Geneva to go to France for New Year. I booked Easyjet insurance in case things went wrong and I could not go. I am a flightclub member. France banned UK residents from coming to France so now we cant go - we are not allowed. EasyJet will not refund the flights as they are to Switzerland not France.  Easyjet are not doing the right thing and refunding flights. I spoke to Flightclub customer service who told me I could have a voucher. But with insurance I would have to call the insurance number to get a refund. After a few days i got thru to Insurance who told me my insurance did not cover governments telling me I couldn't go to their country! I then called Flightclub back who then said no voucher was available as I was flying to Geneva - not directly into France.! So all I could get back was my taxes! If you are in a similar situation please complain as this is outrageous behaviour!",negative
" Flight was OK, but was delayed by an hour because of a dreadful bag-check in. They were still checking bags in when the gate closed because of not enough check-in personnel. We stood in the queue for 90 minutes just to check our bags in watching the flight gate close with no communication from anyone. The rest of the flight was OK, landed one hour later than expected in the end which isn't too bad given the poor start.",neutral
